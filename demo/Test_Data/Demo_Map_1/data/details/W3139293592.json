The importance of BC is linked to sustainability goals, since it is an easily degradable biomaterial of low toxicity to the environment and is a renewable raw material. For use in the textile area, bacterial cellulose has attracted great interest from researchers, but it presents some challenges, notably hydrophilicity due to its porous structure. This bibliometric review article gathers studies and methods related to minimizing the hydrophilicity of bacterial cellulose in order to expand its applicability in the textile industry. The databases consulted were ScienceDirect, ProQuest and Web of Science, the documents investigated were scientific articles and the time period investigated was between 2015 and 2021. The discussion is focused on the applicability of BC in the textile industry, highlighting the research needs, especially with regard to reducing wettability.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":76,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
