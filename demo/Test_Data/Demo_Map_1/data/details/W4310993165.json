The concept was transformed into a field study with four modules built and tested with synthetic gray water. Each module set contains a small and larger module with the same treatment substrate and was fed hourly. A combination of lightweight structural material and biochar of agricultural residues and wood chips was used as the treatment substrate. In this article, we present the first 18 weeks of operation. Regarding the treatment efficiency, the parameters chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorous (TP), ortho-phosphate (ortho-P), total bound nitrogen (TN b ), ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 -N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N) were analyzed and are presented in this work. The results of the modules with agricultural residues are promising. Up to 92% COD reduction is stated in the data. The phosphate and nitrogen fractions are reduced significantly in these modules. By contrast, the modules with wood chips reduce only 67% of the incoming COD and respectively less regarding phosphates and the nitrogen fraction.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":6},"references":9,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
