They fall under the overarching classification of interactive connected smart (ICS) materials and can be integrated with inactive substrates to form hybrid material systems (HMS). This chapter articulates the embodied materials experience emerging from a case study of collaborative tinkering practice with hybrid materials embedding bioplastics and electronics, through digital fabrication and biomaterial cooking. This experience extends to an educational workshop, generating interactive artefact concepts and unveiling the potentials of this practice to enable multidisciplinary collaboration, experiential learning, and critical thinking.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":47,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
