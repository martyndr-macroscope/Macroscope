Bacteriocins are a group of ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides that help in maintaining the quality of food. The implementation of multi-omics approach has been important for the overall enhancement of the quality of the food. This review uses various recent technologies like proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics for the overall enhancement of the quality of food products. The matrix associated with the food products requires the use of sophisticated technologies that help in the extraction of a large amount of information necessary for the amelioration of the food products. This review would provide a wholesome view of how various recent technologies can be used for improving the quality food products and for enhancing their shelf-life.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":11},"references":145,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
