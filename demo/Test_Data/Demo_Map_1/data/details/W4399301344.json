Limited research on the salt tolerance of P. putida KT2440 has hindered its application. In this study, the strain KT2440 was tested to tolerate a maximum of 4% w/v NaCl cultured with minimal salts medium. Transcriptomic data in a high-salinity environment showed significant expression changes in genes in membrane components, redox processes, chemotaxis, and cellular catabolic processes. betB-encoding betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase was identified from the transcriptome data to overexpress and enhance growth profile of the strain KT2440 in minimal salts medium containing 4% w/v NaCl. Meanwhile, screening for exogenous salt-tolerant genes revealed that the Na+/H+ antiporter EcnhaA from Escherichia coli significantly increased the growth of the strain KT2440 in 4% w/v NaCl. Then, co-expression of EcnhaA and betB (KT2440-EcnhaA-betB) increased the maximum salt tolerance of strain KT2440 to 5% w/v NaCl. Further addition of betaine and proline improved the salt tolerance of the engineered strain to 6% w/v NaCl. Finally, the engineered strain KT2440-EcnhaA-betB was able to degrade 56.70% of benzoic acid and 95.64% of protocatechuic acid in minimal salt medium containing 4% w/v NaCl in 48 h, while no biodegradation was observed in the normal strain KT2440 in the same conditions. However, the strain KT2440-EcnhaA-betB failed to degrade catechol in minimal salt medium containing 3% w/v NaCl. This study illustrated the improvement in the salt tolerance performance of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and the feasibility of engineered strain KT2440 as a potential salt-tolerant bioremediation platform.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":8},"references":58,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
