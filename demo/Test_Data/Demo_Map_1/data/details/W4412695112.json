Apart from understanding the physical behaviour of novel materials, it is also important to grasp how designers and the general audience perceive them. On the one hand, this study investigated mycelium growth in 3D-printed minimal surface shapes using a wood-based filament, and on the other hand, it examined how both designers and the general public experience interacting with mycelium. Using a material-driven design research method, a workshop with architecture students was conducted where various triply periodic minimal surfaces were designed and 3D printed. These shapes were used as molds and impregnated with mycelium, and the growth of mycelium was analyzed visually and photographically. Data on the experiences of the 30 workshop participants of working with mycelium was collected through a survey and analyzed qualitatively. After exhibiting results of the workshop in a public-facing exhibition, semi-structured interviews with members of the general public about their perceptions of mycelium were conducted. Three-dimensionally printed minimal surfaces with wood-based filaments can function as structural cores for mycelium-based composites, and the density of the minimal surface appears to influence mycelium growth, which binds to wood-based filaments. Students exhibited stronger feelings for living materials compared to non-living ones, displaying both biophilia and, to a lesser extent, biophobia. Introducing hands-on workshops with living and experimental materials in design studio settings can help future generations of designers develop sensibilities for, and a critical approach towards, the impact of their design decisions on the environment and sustainability. The study also contributes empirical data on how members of the general public perceive mycelium as a material for design.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":53,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
