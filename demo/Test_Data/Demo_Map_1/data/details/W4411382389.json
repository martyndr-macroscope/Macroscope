The paper aims to analyze the designed building as a model spatial and functional solution that responds to the needs of education and climate change activities. The methodology includes an analysis of existing facilities with similar functions and a discussion and evaluation of the center designed by the author. The result of the paper is the identification of key features and functions that should characterize facilities of this type – including the flexibility of space to adapt to dynamic changes in scientific research and the integration of educational, research, and exhibition functions. The article also emphasizes the importance of locating in a disused limestone pit, enabling the use of its peculiarities as part of the facility's narrative, relating to the impact of human activity on the environment and its regeneration processes. The conclusions of the analysis highlight the importance of specialized spaces for educating the public and implementing ideas.</ns3:p>","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":12,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
