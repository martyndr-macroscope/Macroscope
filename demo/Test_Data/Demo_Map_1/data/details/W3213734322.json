The effect of these collaborations has mostly been to promote public engagement with science and commercial innovation. Yet, it is unclear how such arrangements work, what impact aesthetic approaches have, and whether they are appropriate ways for artists to engage with other disciplines. This text analyses two case studies of aesthetic strategies of 'mirroring' and 'friction synthesis' as deployed within institutional environmental governance processes. This text argues that aesthetic strategies can highlight blind spots in environmental governance and do this without creating an oppositional critique. Instead, aesthetic strategies can engage with existing governance processes and build alternative worlds within them.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":17,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
