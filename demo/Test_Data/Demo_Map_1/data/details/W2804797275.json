Forest landscape restoration (FLR) in particular may be said to have acted as an ambassador for the wider restoration cause. Yet how different communities and disciplines interpret this complex term has implications for their implementation decisions. Although the term FLR is used widely, it signifies different things to different people. Ambiguity may prove to be both an asset and a liability. The objective of this article is to understand how different disciplines interpret FLR. I first review the diversity of terms and definitions related to the broad concept of restoration and then identify the interpretations different groups make of the term ‘forest landscape restoration’. Five constructs are proposed based on these interpretations. The ultimate aim is to facilitate FLR implementation by raising awareness among practitioners and policymakers of the variety of interpretations of FLR, associated with different disciplines and communities of practice, and to facilitate the identification of common ground so that implementation can proceed. I conclude that there are significant divergences on the objectives of the term FLR and propose opportunities for collaboration, including through the sustainable development goals, to scale up restoration in the face of such divergences.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":66},"references":60,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
