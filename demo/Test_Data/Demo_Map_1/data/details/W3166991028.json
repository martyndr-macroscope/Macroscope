In the biomaterials industry, electrospinning is a ubiquitous fabrication method for producing nano- to micro-scale fibrous meshes that resemble native tissues, but this process traditionally utilizes solvents that are environmentally hazardous and pose a significant barrier to industrial scale-up and clinical translation. Applying sustainability principles to biomaterial production, we have developed a 'green electrospinning' process by systematically testing biologically benign solvents (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Q3C Class 3), and have identified acetic acid as a green solvent that exhibits low ecological impact (global warming potential (GWP) = 1.40 CO2eq. kg/L) and supports a stable electrospinning jet under routine fabrication conditions. By tuning electrospinning parameters, such as needle-plate distance and flow rate, we updated the fabrication of widely utilized biomedical polymers (e.g. poly-α-hydroxyesters, collagen), polymer blends, polymer-ceramic composites, and growth factor delivery systems. Resulting 'green' fibers and composites are comparable to traditional meshes in terms of composition, chemistry, architecture, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility. Interestingly, material properties of green synthetic fibers are more biomimetic than those of traditionally electrospun fibers, doubling in ductility (91.86 ± 35.65 vs. 45 ± 15.07%,n= 10,p< 0.05) without compromising yield strength (1.32 ± 0.26 vs. 1.38 ± 0.32 MPa) or ultimate tensile strength (2.49 ± 0.55 vs. 2.36 ± 0.45 MPa). Most importantly, green electrospinning proves advantageous for biofabrication, rendering a greater protection of growth factors during fiber formation (72.30 ± 1.94 vs. 62.87 ± 2.49% alpha helical content,n= 3,p< 0.05) and recapitulating native ECM mechanics in the fabrication of biopolymer-based meshes (16.57 ± 3.92% ductility, 33.38 ± 30.26 MPa elastic modulus, 1.30 ± 0.19 MPa yield strength, and 2.13 ± 0.36 MPa ultimate tensile strength,n= 10). The eco-conscious approach demonstrated here represents a paradigm shift in biofabrication, and will accelerate the translation of scalable biomaterials and biomimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":68},"references":92,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
