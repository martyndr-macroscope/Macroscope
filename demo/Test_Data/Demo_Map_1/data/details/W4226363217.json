There is substantial literature on coproduction for governance, but much of it is aspirational and methodological, and it does not ask why such processes fail to meet stated objectives. This review examines the literature on governance and co-production to fill this gap. The conceptual paper discusses governance through co-production. The purpose of this study is to identify gaps in the literature concerning the relations between co-production and governance in order to better understand co-production in governance. The study, therefore, identifies that the literature does not adequately address the cause and effect relationship between co-production and governance. When there is no shared decision-making framework and no common rules, the potential of co-production is likely to be limited. The main causes are that the many actors' values differ, and there is a lack of a defined framework for decision-making, which can lead to conflicts. Second, due to a lack of expertise and resources, not all citizens have equal access to co-production. As a result, in the case of co-production, it is vital to first clarify the governance model by outlining the process by which choices are made and implemented.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":41,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
