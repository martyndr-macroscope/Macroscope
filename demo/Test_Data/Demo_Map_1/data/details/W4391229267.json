It can thus be considered a potential theoretical underpinning of responsible innovation (RI). This article explores the relationship between CT and RI by looking at how CT can influence the practice of researchers who implement RI, typically as part of scientific and technical projects. It proposes a theoretical framework based on three dimensions of criticality: the legitimacy, motivational, and epistemological dimensions. These three dimensions can be used to represent a space of CT where RI scholars can take different roles which influence their RI practice. The article offers some anecdotal evidence to support the validity of the conceptual framework. It proposes a research agenda to validate this framework.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":4},"references":83,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
