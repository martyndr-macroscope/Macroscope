The highly selective generation of catalytical active species (•OH) to facilitate this process presents a significant scientific challenge. Therefore, a novel approach for designing photocatalysts with single-atom containment in metal-covalent organic frameworks (M-COFs) is proposed. The selection of imine-linked COFs containing abundant N and O-chelate sites provides a solid foundation for anchoring metal atom. These dispersed metal atom possess rapid accumulation and transfer capabilities for photogenerated electrons, while the periodic π-conjugated structure in 2D-COFs establishes an effective platform. Additionally, the Lewis acid properties of imine bonds in COFs can enhance the adsorption capacity toward gases with Lewis base properties, such as O","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":94},"references":75,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
