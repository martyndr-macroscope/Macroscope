Factors such as innovation, design methods, component reuse, prototyping, and digital fabrication empower prosumer designers to realize their ideas and enhance products to meet their specific design requirements. This article presents a case that combines bioinspired design methods with prosumer characteristics from the perspective of a designer who uses biological research results acting as a prosumer. By analyzing prosumer needs, bioinspired design, and domestic fabrication requirements, designers define the methods that best suit their possibilities. As a result of using biological information, the geometry of Samara seeds, propeller sizing, wind tunnel tests, and subsequent improvements, the custom design of a bioinspired microgenerator has been refined to the final design of a bicycle flashlight. The aim is to popularize a working approach that facilitates the interaction of design methods and reinforces domestic manufacturing processes. Implementing bioinspired design methods within the prosumer context offers a methodological alternative to transform the current economic model, promoting systemic sustainability and the development of proprietary technologies.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":50,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
