Traditional microbiology education often fails to engage diverse audiences, perpetuating gaps in societal decision‐making. This opinion piece argues for expanded microbial literacy through interdisciplinary, experiential learning, with exhibitions proposed as critical platforms to bridge science, culture and society. Drawing on the International Microbiology Literacy Initiative (IMiLI) mission, the contributions of spatial and narrative‐driven encounters are considered—from ancient memory palaces to modern theatres of microbial activity—in transforming otherwise abstract microbial processes into tangible, transferrable, actionable knowledge. Individual case studies of historic and contemporary exhibitions such as We the Bacteria: Notes Toward Biotic Architecture are examined through a curatorial vision to understand how the relationship between people and microbes can be shaped through experiential knowledge while advancing microbial literacy. However, such initiatives require careful balancing of innovation with ethical communication to avoid reductive or misleading narratives. Scaling these approaches through global collaboration between scientists, educators and designers—aligned with IMiLI's vision of lifelong, learner‐centric microbiology education—could effectively engage audiences who have limited access to scientific knowledge, resources, or engagement opportunities and support progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goals.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
