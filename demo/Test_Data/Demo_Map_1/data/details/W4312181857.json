The article explores the creation and manipulation of life through the examples of three types of transgenic art projects: works by Eduardo Kac, performance, and the creation of semi-living organisms. The main aim of the article is to present the phenomenon of bioart against the background of fundamental dogmatic truths concerning creation and man, and then to draw theological conclusions. The addressed issues concern interspecies boundaries, bioartists’ interference with life, and man’s place in the world. An analysis and reflection of this kind reveals the transcendental nature of life in terms of its creatureliness in relation to God, places fundamental truths at the forefront, refers to theological and biblical terminology, and shows theological anthropology as the most appropriate place to understand the essence of life.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":12,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
