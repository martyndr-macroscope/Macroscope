Constitutive vectors are composed of 16 synthetic constitutive promoters upstream of RFP, with a broad host range BBR1 origin and a kanamycin resistance marker. The family also has seven inducible systems (Jungle Express, Psal/NahR, Pm/XylS, Prha/RhaS, LacO1/LacI, LacUV5/LacI, and Ptet/TetR) controlling RFP expression on BBR1/kanamycin plasmid backbones. For four of these inducible systems (Jungle Express, Psal/NahR, LacO1/LacI, and Ptet/TetR), we created variants that utilize the RK2 origin and spectinomycin or gentamicin selection. Relevant RFP expression and growth data have been collected in the model bacterium Escherichia coli as well as Pseudomonas putida . All pGinger vectors are available via the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) Public Registry.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":27,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
