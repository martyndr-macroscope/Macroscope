The authors transform a squid’s skin into an audio visualizer called Chromatophony. This is accomplished by sending an electric tone signal composed as music to the skin. Although Chromatophony’s appearance is similar to that of computer-generated images, it is based on a natural phenomenon with a colorful mosaic display. By comparing chromatophores with pixels, the authors propose Living Images to expand the potential of visual expression from the perspective of bioart theory.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":14,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
