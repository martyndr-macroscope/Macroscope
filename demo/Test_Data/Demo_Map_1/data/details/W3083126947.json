In this exploratory article, we propose an original and tentative definition and taxonomy of Bio-Synergistic materials. By analyzing the best examples within the taxonomy, we argue that they elicit emerging materials experiences related to being alive, provocative, and surprising, unfolding a unique set of emotions, feelings, and experiences for users. Such experiences promote a shift in values in society, addressing a complex system of values related to interdependence, environmental consciousness, multi-species collaborations, caring, transience, and imperfection, and re-centering design approaches from being anthropocentric to becoming more-than-human. The findings are articulated in an original framework of Bio-Synergistic materials for socially meaningful design. This preliminary investigation may be extended into a solid research theme, catalyzing positive implications for nature, technology, and society.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":3},"references":51,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
