The turbine engine is one of the machines that often experience damage to the point where it has a big impact on the cessation of the palm oil processing process. The digital twin concept focuses on the characteristics of a turbine engine so that it can represent physical objects in digital form. Meanwhile, predictive maintenance focuses on parameters that affect turbine engine damage, as well as data obtained from sensors, such as temperature data, capacity, and normal engine time to critical engine time. The application of digital twins for predictive maintenance of turbine engines requires five stages, namely building digital twins, obtaining, and exploring data, preprocessing training data, develop predictive models, and deploy algorithms. This study describes the architectural design of the predictive maintenance model using the digital twin concept which is applied to the maintenance of turbine engines in the palm oil processing process. In future research, the predictive maintenance model using the digital twin concept is expected to be able to predict machine maintenance schedules to overcome the risk of forced downtime, increase the life of production machines and help estimate maintenance costs.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
