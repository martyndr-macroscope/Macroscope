Yet we have little understanding of how both designers and scientists identify what makes a good collaborative project brief, a phase we call treasure hunting. We conducted two studies with 18 designers and 10 scientists to better understand this mechanism: how do designers generate ideas from laboratories and how scientists perceive these ideas? We found that designers’ strategies rely on identifying the uniqueness of the laboratory’s research and their long-term vision. We also identified four strategies to ideate from the laboratories’ research: finding new application domains, bringing the research to the hands of the end-user, styling and finding new research directions. In the second study, we presented the resulting ideas back to professors and results suggest that initial designers’ ideas —sacrificial ideas— can be a powerful tool to support scientists reframing process.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":4},"references":35,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
