In an effort to increase predictability of expression of genes of interest in a variety of possible bacterial hosts we propose a composition standard for debugging and reassembling all regulatory parts that participate in the performance of such devices. As a case study we address the n -octane and dicyclopropyl ketone (DCPK)-inducible P alkB promoter of the alkane biodegradation pOCT plasmid of Pseudomonas putida . The standardized expression module consisted of an edited alkS regulatory gene that is divergently expressed and separated of P alkB by a synthetic DNA buffer sequence. The native DNA sequence of the structural alkS gene was modified to alleviate the catabolite repression exerted by some carbon and nitrogen sources through the Crc/Hfq complex of some hosts. The P alkB promoter along with the alkS variants were then formatted as SEVA (Standard European Vector Architecture) cargoes and their activity parameters in P. putida determined with GFP and luminiscent reporters. The thereby refactored system showed improvements in various features desirable in conditional expression modules: inducibility, capacity, noise reduction and on/off ratio. When applied to other promoter/regulator pairs, the compositional standard thereby implemented in the AlkS/ P alkB module will enable more complex genetic programming in non-model bacteria.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":51,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
