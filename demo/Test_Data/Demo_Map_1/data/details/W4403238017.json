With the escalating impacts of global climate change and increasing human activities, microalgal production must be enhanced by reducing freshwater and land use and minimizing carbon emissions. The advent of 3D printing offers novel opportunities for optimizing microalgae production, though it faces challenges such as high production costs and scalability concerns. This work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in 3D-printed bioreactors for microalgal production, focusing on 3D printing techniques, bio-ink types, and their applications across environmental, food, and medical fields. This review highlights the benefits of 3D-printed bioreactors, including improved mass transfer, optimized light exposure, enhanced biomass yield, and augmented photosynthesis. Current challenges and future directions of 3D printing in microalgal production are also discussed to offer new insights into boosting microalgal cultivation efficiency for expanded applications.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":7},"references":78,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
