This analysis incorporates 146 articles on this topic, published from 2014 to 2024 and indexed in the Scopus database. A bibliometric approach was used to systematically analyze these publications, incorporating performance analysis and science mapping techniques. The findings reveal that the core themes in AI-enabled SC research within Industry 5.0 include sustainable SC management, advanced technology integration to enhance manufacturing efficiency, and digitalization-driven sustainable industrialization. Emerging themes address the integration of advanced AI technologies in SC processes, supporting sustainable industrial development and the conceptualization of an Industry 5.0 paradigm. The study serves as a critical resource for academics, scholars, and industry practitioners in exploring the integration of AI and Industry 5.0 in supporting sustainable supply chains.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":79,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
