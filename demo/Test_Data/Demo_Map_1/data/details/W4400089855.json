The method allows for rapid prototyping of macrofluidic devices with control over fluid manipulation and environmental conditions. We employed a high-resolution laser cutter to etch fluidic channels into various substrates, optimizing parameters such as laser power, speed, and substrate material. Our results demonstrate excellent performance in controlling fluid flow and maintaining environmental conditions, handling a wide range of fluids and flow rates. The devices were tested in multiple settings such as with high school students and in research laboratories in universities. We tested the laser-printed macrofluidcs mechanically for durability. We present previous works in microbiology with plants, microbial, and mammalian cell lines showing reliable operation with minimal leakage and consistent fluid dynamics. The versatility and scalability of this approach make it a promising tool for advancing research and innovation in fluidics, providing a robust platform for growing, manipulating, and experimenting with diverse biological systems from cells to whole organisms. We conclude that laser-printed macrofluidics can significantly contribute to fields such as biomedical research, synthetic biology, tissue engineering, and STEM education.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":41,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
