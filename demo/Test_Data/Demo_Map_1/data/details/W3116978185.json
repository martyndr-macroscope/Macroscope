Bioglycerol, with its growing production as a co‐product of biodiesel, is an attractive low‐cost feedstock for the synthesis of platform chemicals by microbial fermentation. 2,3‐butanediol (2,3‐BDO) is amongst the top biorefinery platform chemicals that can be produced by glycerol fermentation. RESULTS The ‘Circular Economy’ concept is demonstrated by converting the by‐product bioglycerol using a cell‐free extract of Enterobacter aerogenes NCIM 2695 (National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms, NCIM), yielding 22 g L −1 2,3‐BDO, in 96 h, 98% atom economy and 0.4 g/g E factor. The cell‐free bioglycerol conversion to 2,3‐BDO was proved using a modified procedure for determining glycerol dehydrogenase enzyme assay by protein analysis and it was also shown to be cell‐bounded. CONCLUSION Our study offers an effective utilization of the leftover material (i.e. cell‐free extract) that biocatalysed C3 to C4 diol, which adds value to the overall economics of the process using only crude glycerol (C3) itself as a fermentative medium. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":55,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
