For this, we analyzed 194 manuscripts published in the Scopus and Web of Science databases that dealt with cultured meat under the perspective of cellular agriculture, employing several nomenclatures. The results indicate that there is still no consensus in the literature about the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities of cultured meat, which constitutes an emerging, multifaceted, and encouraging field of study, and a series of inferences have been made that provide insights into the knowledge analyzed. Finally, we propose an analytical model that combines sub-scenarios from which it becomes possible to understand and anticipate the direction of this new food biotechnology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":21},"references":130,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
