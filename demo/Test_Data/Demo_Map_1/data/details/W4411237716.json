A Scoping Review of Post-Anthropocentric Artifacts and Their Design Strategies","authors":["Madlen Kneile","Judith Dörrenbächer","Marc Hassenzahl","Matthias Laschke"],"venue":"ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","year":2025,"doi":"10.1145/3743674","url":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3743674","openalex":"https://openalex.org/W4411237716","abstract":"The threatening environmental problems of our time challenge the notion that humans are separate from and dominant over nature. As a result, many studies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) address alternatives to human-centered design and explore post-anthropocentric approaches that decenter humans and consider nature in technology design. The question, however, is how to design post-anthropocentric technology that engages humans and nature. Based on the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a scoping review and analyzed 53 papers, from which we extracted 114 post-anthropocentric artifacts that enable human-nature engagement. We identified seven design strategies, such as recognizing, exploring, and empowering that can guide the future design of post-anthropocentric artifacts. Most of the artifacts included support human agency, fewer support nature's agency, or advocate for nature to achieve an equitable human-nature relation. We identified opportunities for the field, such as empowering nature and further exploring the implications of post-anthropocentric design for addressing environmental problems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":0},"references":149,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
