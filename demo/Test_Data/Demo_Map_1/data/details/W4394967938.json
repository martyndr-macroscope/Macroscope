Its fundamental principles are based on the reduction, reuse and recycling of resources, promoting sustainability and minimizing waste. This new way of thinking has applications in a variety of sectors, from manufacturing to waste management. The implementation of government policies and regulations play an important role in promoting the circular economy by setting standards and requirements for responsible resource management. However, there are challenges and barriers that need to be overcome, such as resistance to change and the need for upfront investments. Despite these obstacles, there are successful examples of circular economy around the world, demonstrating the tangible benefits of this approach in terms of waste reduction. This paper presents an exploration and analysis of the circular economy, providing a vision of its foundation, applications and challenges in promoting a more sustainable management of resources and products globally.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":208,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
