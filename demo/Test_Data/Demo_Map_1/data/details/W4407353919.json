Sustainable development states the urgent need to implement actions to gradually replace fossil resources, including the use of renewable raw materials such as residues and secondary raw materials from other industries as a promising alternative to replace fossil resources. This research explores an approach focused on the design of renewable materials by developing a bio-based textile coating with the use of sawdust from radiata pine, which is the result of industrial wood transformation processes. The methodology adopted a transdisciplinary approach, integrating knowledge from design, engineering, and sociology disciplines. A perceived sawdust quality study was carried out in its original format, while two different coated textile substrates were developed, using knife-over-roller and spray coating processes, which were evaluated from user acceptance and functional performance points of views. Finally, a clothing prototype for workwear, using the bio-based coatings, was developed, employing a mono-material design concept (i.e., using the same material in all its forms). The results obtained from users and laboratory studies favour the knife-over-roller coating and the removable clothing design, which provides improved usability performance. The obtained conclusions highlight that transdisciplinary collaboration is essential to address complex challenges in the development of solutions, placing the design of material as a necessary prior action in the design process of final products.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":55,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
