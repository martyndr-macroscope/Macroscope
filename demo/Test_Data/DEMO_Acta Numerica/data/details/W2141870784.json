Due to their indefiniteness and often poor spectral properties, such linear systems represent a significant challenge for solver developers. In recent years there has been a surge of interest in saddle point problems, and numerous solution techniques have been proposed for this type of system. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss a large selection of solution methods for linear systems in saddle point form, with an emphasis on iterative methods for large and sparse problems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":2235},"references":476,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
