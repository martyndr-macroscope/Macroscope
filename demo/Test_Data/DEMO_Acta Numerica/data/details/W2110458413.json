Krylov methods and variants of subspace iteration have been improved to the point that problems of the order of several million variables can be solved. The methods and software that have led to these advances are surveyed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":132},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
