This article surveys nonlinear eigenvalue problems associated with matrix-valued functions which depend nonlinearly on a single scalar parameter, with a particular emphasis on their mathematical properties and available numerical solution techniques. Solvers based on Newton’s method, contour integration and sampling via rational interpolation are reviewed. Problems of selecting the appropriate parameters for each of the solver classes are discussed and illustrated with numerical examples. This survey also contains numerous MATLAB code snippets that can be used for interactive exploration of the discussed methods.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":200},"references":190,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
