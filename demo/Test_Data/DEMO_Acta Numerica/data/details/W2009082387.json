We review the different ways devised to speed them up, both with regard to components and their architecture. In addition, we discuss the requirements for software that can take advantage of existing and future architectures.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":60},"references":21,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
