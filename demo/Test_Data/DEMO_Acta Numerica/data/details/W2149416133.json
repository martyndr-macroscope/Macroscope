As with most optimization methods, SQP is not a single algorithm, but rather a conceptual method from which numerous specific algorithms have evolved. Backed by a solid theoretical and computational foundation, both commercial and public-domain SQP algorithms have been developed and used to solve a remarkably large set of important practical problems. Recently large-scale versions have been devised and tested with promising results.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1733},"references":79,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
