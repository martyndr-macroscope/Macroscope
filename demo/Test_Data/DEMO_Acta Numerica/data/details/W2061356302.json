The retention of Lie-group structure under discretization is often vital in the recovery of qualitatively correct geometry and dynamics and in the minimization of numerical error. Having introduced requisite elements of differential geometry, this paper surveys the novel theory of numerical integrators that respect Lie-group structure, highlighting theory, algorithmic issues and a number of applications.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":751},"references":80,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
