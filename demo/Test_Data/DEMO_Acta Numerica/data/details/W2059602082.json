In this paper, devoted to l 1 /nuclear norm minimization as ‘optimization beasts’, we give a detailed description of two attractive first-order optimization techniques for solving problems of this type. The first one, aimed primarily at lasso-type problems, comprises fast gradient methods applied to composite minimization formulations. The second approach, aimed at Dantzig-selector-type problems, utilizes saddle-point first-order algorithms and reformulation of the problem of interest as a generalized bilinear saddle-point problem . For both approaches, we give complete and detailed complexity analyses and discuss the application domains.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":45},"references":113,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
