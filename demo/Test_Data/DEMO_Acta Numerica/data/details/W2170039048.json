The variational technique gives a unified treatment of many symplectic schemes, including those of higher order, as well as a natural treatment of the discrete Noether theorem. The approach also allows us to include forces, dissipation and constraints in a natural way. Amongst the many specific schemes treated as examples, the Verlet, SHAKE, RATTLE, Newmark, and the symplectic partitioned Runge–Kutta schemes are presented.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":1505},"references":142,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
