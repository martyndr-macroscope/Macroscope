In conjunction with iterative methods, preconditioning is often the vital component in enabling the solution of such systems when the dimension is large. We attempt a broad review of preconditioning methods.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":182},"references":161,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
