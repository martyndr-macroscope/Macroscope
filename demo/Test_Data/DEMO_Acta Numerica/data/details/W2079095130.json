Iterative methods for initial value problems have a history of more than a century, and in the works of Picard (1893) and Lindelöf (1894) they were given a firm theoretical basis. In particular, the superlinear convergence on finite intervals is included in Lindelöf (1894).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":27},"references":40,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
