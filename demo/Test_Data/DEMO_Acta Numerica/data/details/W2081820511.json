These techniques are based on solving initial value partial differential equations for level set functions, using techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. The methodology results in robust, accurate, and efficient numerical algorithms for propagating interfaces in highly complex settings. We review the basic theory and approximations, describe a hierarchy of fast methods, including an extremely fast marching level set scheme for monotonically advancing fronts, based on a stationary formulation of the problem, and discuss extensions to multiple interfaces and triple points. Finally, we demonstrate the technique applied to a series of examples from geometry, material science and computer vision, including mean curvature flow, minimal surfaces, grid generation, fluid mechanics, combustion, image processing, computer vision, and etching, deposition and lithography in the microfabrication of electronic components.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":251},"references":108,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
