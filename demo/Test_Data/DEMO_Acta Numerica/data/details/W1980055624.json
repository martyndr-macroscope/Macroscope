We shall show that under reasonable invariance and assumptions, all image (and shape) analyses can be reduced to a single partial differential equation. In the same way, movie analysis leads to a single parabolic differential equation. We discuss some applications to image segmentation and movie restoration. The experiments show how accurate and invariant the numerical schemes must be and we compare several (old and new) algorithms by discussing how well they match the axiomatic invariance requirements.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":126},"references":86,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
