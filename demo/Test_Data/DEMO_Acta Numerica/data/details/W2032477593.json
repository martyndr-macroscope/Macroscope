The approaches to grid generation that are discussed include Cartesian, multi-block-structured, overlapping and unstructured. Emphasis is placed on those methods that can create high-quality grids appropriate for the solution of equations of a hyperbolic nature, such as those that arise in fluid dynamics. Numerous figures illustrate the different grid generation techniques.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":25},"references":44,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
