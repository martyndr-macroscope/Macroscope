This paper reviews the main ideas of reduced-order modelling techniques based on Krylov subspaces and describes some applications of reduced-order modelling in circuit simulation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":330},"references":81,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
