Continuum models have been developed explaining microstructure as the mixture of these symmetry-related states on a fine scale to minimize energy. This article is a review of numerical methods and the numerical analysis for the computation of crystalline microstructure.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":178},"references":153,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
