To this end, it provides, without any recourse to any a priori assumptions of a geometrical or mechanical nature, a mathematical justification of two-dimensional linear shell theories , by means of asymptotic methods , with the thickness as the ‘small’ parameter . A major virtue of this approach is that it naturally leads to precise mathematical definitions of linearly elastic ‘membrane’ and ‘flexural’ shells . Another noteworthy feature is that it highlights in particular the role played by two fundamental tensors , each associated with a displacement field of the middle surface, the linearized change of metric and linearized change of curvature tensors . More specifically, under fundamentally distinct sets of assumptions bearing on the geometry of the middle surface , on the boundary conditions , and on the order of magnitude of the applied forces , it is shown that the three-dimensional displacements, once properly scaled, converge (in H 1 , or in L 2 , or in ad hoc completions) as the thickness approaches zero towards a ‘two-dimensional’ limit that satisfies either the linear two-dimensional equations of a ‘membrane’ shell (themselves divided into two subclasses) or the linear two-dimensional equations of a ‘flexural’ shell . Note that this asymptotic analysis automatically provides in each case the ‘limit’ two-dimensional equations , together with the function space over which they are well-posed. The linear two-dimensional shell equations that are most commonly used in numerical simulations, namely Koiter's equations , Naghdi's equations , and ‘shallow’ shell equations , are then carefully described, mathematically analysed, and likewise justified by means of asymptotic analyses. The existence and uniqueness of solutions to each one of these linear two-dimensional shell equations are also established by means of crucial inequalities of Korn's type on surfaces , which are proved in detail at the beginning of the article. This article serves as a mathematical basis for the numerically oriented companion article by Dominique Chapelle, also in this issue of Acta Numerica .","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
