To this end procedural programs for the evaluation of problem-specific functions are transformed into programs that also compute the required derivative values at the same numerical arguments in floating point arithmetic. Disregarding many important implementation issues, we examine in this article complexity bounds and other more mathematical aspects of the program transformation task sketched above.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":106},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
