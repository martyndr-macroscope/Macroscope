But trying to be three things at once makes the notion difficult to understand. We will explain tensors in an accessible and elementary way through the lens of linear algebra and numerical linear algebra, elucidated with examples from computational and applied mathematics.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":33},"references":296,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
