Despite significant progress in the past few decades, the numerical solution of Kohn–Sham DFT problems remains challenging, especially for large-scale systems. In this paper we review the basics as well as state-of-the-art numerical methods, and focus on the unique numerical challenges of DFT.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":47},"references":312,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
