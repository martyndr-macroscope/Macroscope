It covers discrete time strong and weak approximation methods that are suitable for different applications. A range of approaches and results is discussed within a unified framework. On the one hand, these methods can be interpreted as generalizing the well-developed theory on numerical analysis for deterministic ordinary differential equations. On the other hand they highlight the specific stochastic nature of the equations. In some cases these methods lead to completely new and challenging problems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":266},"references":350,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
