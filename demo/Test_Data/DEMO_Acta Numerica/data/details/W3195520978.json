The study of liquid crystals has made tremendous progress over the past four decades, which is of great importance for fundamental scientific research and has widespread applications in industry. In this paper we review the mathematical models and their connections to liquid crystals, and survey the developments of numerical methods for finding rich configurations of liquid crystals.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":53},"references":267,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
