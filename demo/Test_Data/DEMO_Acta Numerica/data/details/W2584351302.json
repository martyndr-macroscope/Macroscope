In essence, SfM involves the three main stages of (i) extracting features in images ( e.g. points of interest, lines, etc. ) and matching these features between images, (ii) camera motion estimation ( e.g. using relative pairwise camera positions estimated from the extracted features), and (iii) recovery of the 3D structure using the estimated motion and features ( e.g. by minimizing the so-called reprojection error ). This survey mainly focuses on relatively recent developments in the literature pertaining to stages (ii) and (iii). More specifically, after touching upon the early factorization-based techniques for motion and structure estimation, we provide a detailed account of some of the recent camera location estimation methods in the literature, followed by discussion of notable techniques for 3D structure recovery. We also cover the basics of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, which can be viewed as a specific case of the SfM problem. Further, our survey includes a review of the fundamentals of feature extraction and matching ( i.e. stage (i) above), various recent methods for handling ambiguities in 3D scenes, SfM techniques involving relatively uncommon camera models and image features, and popular sources of data and SfM software.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":12},"references":86,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
