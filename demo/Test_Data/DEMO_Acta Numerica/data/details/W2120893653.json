Let us mention, for example, the design of hydraulic turbines or rheologically complex flows appearing in many processes involving plastics or molten metals. Their simulation raises a number of difficulties, some of which are likely to remain while others are now resolved. Among the latter are those related to incompressibility which are also present in the simulation of incompressible or nearly incompressible elastic materials. Among the still unresolved are those associated with high Reynolds numbers which are also met in compressible flows. They involve the formation of boundary layers and turbulence, an ever present phenomenon in fluid mechanics, implying that we have to simulate unsteady, highly unstable phenomena.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":45},"references":69,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
