This article is a survey specifically oriented towards the needs and interests of a numerical analyst. This survey includes some original material not found anywhere else. We include the important mathematics which is a very modern development, as well as the computational software that is transforming the theory into useful practice.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":533},"references":96,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
