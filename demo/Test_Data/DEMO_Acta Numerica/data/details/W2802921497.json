We consider both the fixed-point form $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{x})$ and the equations form $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})=0$ and explain why both versions are necessary to understand the solvers. We include the classical methods to make the presentation complete and discuss less familiar topics such as Anderson acceleration, semi-smooth Newton’s method, and pseudo-arclength and pseudo-transient continuation methods.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":99},"references":158,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
