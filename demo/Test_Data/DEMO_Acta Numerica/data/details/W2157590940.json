However, they were not seriously applied to linear programming because of the dominance of the simplex method. Barrier methods fell from favour during the 1970s for a variety of reasons, including their apparent inefficiency compared with the best available alternatives. In 1984, Karmarkar's announcement of a fast polynomial-time interior method for linear programming caused tremendous excitement in the field of optimization. A formal connection can be shown between his method and classical barrier methods, which have consequently undergone a renaissance in interest and popularity. Most papers published since 1984 have concentrated on issues of computational complexity in interior methods for linear programming. During the same period, implementations of interior methods have displayed great efficiency in solving many large linear programs of ever-increasing size. Interior methods have also been applied with notable success to nonlinear and combinatorial problems. This paper presents a self-contained survey of major themes in both classical material and recent developments related to the theory and practice of interior methods.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":270},"references":65,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
