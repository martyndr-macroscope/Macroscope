The initial inclusion problem, which typically involves several operators combined through monotonicity-preserving operations, is seldom solvable in its original form. We embed it in an auxiliary space, where it is associated with a surrogate monotone inclusion problem with a more tractable structure and which allows for easy recovery of solutions to the initial problem. The surrogate problem is solved by successive projections onto half-spaces containing its solution set. The outer approximation half-spaces are constructed by using the individual operators present in the model separately. This geometric framework is shown to encompass traditional methods as well as state-of-the-art asynchronous block-iterative algorithms, and its flexible structure provides a pattern to design new ones.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":10},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
