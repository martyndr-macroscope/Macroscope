The method is referred to as persistent homology , and has numerous applications to scientific problems. We discuss the definition and computation of homology in the standard setting of simplicial complexes and topological spaces, then show how one can obtain useful signatures, called barcodes, from finite metric spaces, thought of as sampled from a continuous object. We present several different cases where persistent homology is used, to illustrate the different ways in which the method can be applied.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":236},"references":88,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
