Emphasis is given to the error analysis that comes naturally with the framework. Examples of finite element and finite difference HMM are presented. Applications to dynamical systems and stochastic simulation algorithms with multiple time scales, spall fracture and heat conduction in microprocessors are discussed.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":585},"references":217,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
