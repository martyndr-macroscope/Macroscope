This photon count is a stochastic process due to the quantum nature of light. It follows that all images are noisy. Ever since digital images have existed, numerical methods have been proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Such ‘denoising’ methods require a noise model and an image model. It is relatively easy to obtain a noise model. As will be explained in the present paper, it is even possible to estimate it from a single noisy image.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":193},"references":148,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
