This paper describes some of the physical and mathematical properties of the solutions being sought, some of the issues that are encountered when the governing equations are solved numerically, and some of the numerical methods that are being used in this area.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":25},"references":68,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
