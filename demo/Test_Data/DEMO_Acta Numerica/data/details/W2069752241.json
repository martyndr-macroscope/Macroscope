To make the question a bit more precise, I decided to select the best optimization methods known to date – those methods that deserve to be in a subroutine library – and for each method ask: what do we know about the behaviour of this method, as implemented in practice ? To make my task more tractable, I decided to consider only algorithms for unconstrained optimization.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":328},"references":117,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
