This contribution explains why and how kernels are applied in these disciplines. It uncovers the links between them, in so far as they are related to kernel techniques. It addresses non-expert readers and focuses on practical guidelines for using kernels in applications.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":269},"references":190,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
