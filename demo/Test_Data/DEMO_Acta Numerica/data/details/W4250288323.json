Indeed, the search direction sequence { w n } n ≥0 was improperly defined leading to a slow convergence; for the ‘small’ values of k (e.g. 10 2 , 10 3 ) the computed results were essentially correct, but for larger values the slow convergence prevented us from reaching the correct limit since we stopped iterating after a fixed number of iterations (300 or 500, depending of the test problem).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
