We include in the presentation techniques for deriving effective equations, a brief discussion on analysis of related limit processes and numerical methods that are based on homogenization principles. We concentrate on first- and second-order partial differential equations and present results concerning both periodic and random media for linear as well as nonlinear problems. In the numerical sections, we comment on computations of multi-scale problems in general and then focus on projection-based numerical homogenization and the heterogeneous multi-scale method.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":144},"references":76,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
