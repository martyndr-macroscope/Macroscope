This survey focuses on sequential data assimilation techniques using probabilistic particle-based algorithms. In addition to surveying recent developments for discrete- and continuous-time data assimilation, both in terms of mathematical foundations and algorithmic implementations, we also provide a unifying framework from the perspective of coupling of measures, and Schrödinger’s boundary value problem for stochastic processes in particular.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":42},"references":83,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
