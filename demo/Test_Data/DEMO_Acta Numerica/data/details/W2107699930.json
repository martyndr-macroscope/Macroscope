They have been known, tested and analysed for several years now and many positive properties have been identified. This paper gives a selective but up-to-date survey of several recent developments that explains their usefulness from the theoretical point of view and contributes useful new classes of radial basis function. We consider particularly the new results on convergence rates of interpolation with radial basis functions, as well as some of the various achievements on approximation on spheres, and the efficient numerical computation of interpolants for very large sets of data. Several examples of useful applications are stated at the end of the paper.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":1514},"references":57,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
