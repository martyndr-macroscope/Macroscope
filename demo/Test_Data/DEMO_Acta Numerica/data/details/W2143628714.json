Further new applications to areas such as polynomial systems of equations, linear eigenvalue problems, interior methods for linear programming, parametric programming and complex bifurcation are surveyed. Complexity issues and available software are also discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":262},"references":312,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
