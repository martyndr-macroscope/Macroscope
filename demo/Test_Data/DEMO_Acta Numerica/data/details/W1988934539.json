They lead to a complete L^\\infty(L^1) -approximation theory with which error estimates for numerical methods for this type of equation can be obtained. The approach we consider consists in obtaining continuous dependence results for the solutions of parabolic conservation laws and deducing from them the corresponding results for the entropy solution. This is a natural approach, as the entropy solution is nothing but the limit of solutions of parabolic scalar conservation laws as the viscosity coefficient goes to zero.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":31},"references":109,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
