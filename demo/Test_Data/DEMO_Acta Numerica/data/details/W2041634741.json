We then discuss numerical methods of computing the respective Gauss-type quadrature rules and orthogonal polynomials. The basic task is to compute the coefficients in the three-term recurrence relation for the orthogonal polynomials. This can be done by methods relying either on moment information or on discretization procedures. The effect on the recurrence coefficients of multiplying the weight function by a rational function is also discussed. Similar methods are applicable to computing Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, although their recurrence relations are more complicated. The paper concludes with a brief account of available software.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":158},"references":159,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
