In particular, we indicate how Conley's Fundamental Decomposition Theorem is naturally related to combinatorial approximations of dynamical systems. Furthermore, we show that computations of Morse decompositions and isolating blocks can be performed efficiently. We conclude with examples indicating how these ideas can be applied to finite- and infinite-dimensional discrete and continuous dynamical systems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":50},"references":39,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
