The numerical analysis of bifurcation problems is discussed and the convergence theory for several important bifurcations is described for both projection and finite difference methods. These results are used to provide a convergence theory for the mixed finite element method applied to the steady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Numerical methods for the calculation of several common bifurcations are described and the performance of these methods is illustrated by application to several problems in fluid mechanics. A detailed description of the Taylor–Couette problem is given, and extensive numerical and experimental results are provided for comparison and discussion.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":129},"references":160,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
