This state of affairs means that one cannot rely on the formal ellipticity of the differential operator to ensure the convergence of standard numerical algorithms. Thus new ideas and approaches are required. The survey begins by examining the asymptotic nature of solutions to stationary convection-diffusion problems. This provides a suitable framework for the understanding of these solutions and the difficulties that numerical techniques will face. Various numerical methods expressly designed for convection-diffusion problems are then presented and extensively discussed. These include finite difference and finite element methods and the use of special meshes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":190},"references":41,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
