This approach is very reasonable: since the derivative is a local property of a function, it makes little sense (and is costly) to invoke many function values far away from the point of interest.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":143},"references":120,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
