In particular, we examine their role in a posteriori error estimation, and in the formulation of iterative methods for solving the large sparse sets of linear equations arising from finite element discretization.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":188},"references":39,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
