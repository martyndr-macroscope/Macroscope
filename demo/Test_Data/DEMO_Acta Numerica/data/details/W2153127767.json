For self-adjoint and coercive linear elliptic boundary value problems (with Laplace's equation and the equations of linear elasticity as two typical examples), the convergence theory reached a mature, if not its final state. The present article reviews old and new developments for this type of equation and describes the recent advances.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":211},"references":65,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
