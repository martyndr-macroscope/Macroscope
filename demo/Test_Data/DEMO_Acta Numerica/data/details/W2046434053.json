We introduce the most commonly used models and comment on their applicability. We briefly outline the results of mathematical analysis and then mostly concentrate on the main issues raised by numerical simulations. A special emphasis is laid on recent results in numerical analysis, recent developments of new methods and challenging open issues.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":108},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
