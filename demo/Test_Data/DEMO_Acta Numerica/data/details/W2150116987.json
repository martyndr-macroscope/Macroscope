State-of-the-art algorithms for solving unconstrained, bound-constrained, linearly constrained and non-linearly constrained problems are discussed. As well as important conceptual advances and theoretical aspects, emphasis is also placed on more practical issues, such as software availability.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":143},"references":201,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
