These algorithms typically examine only a subset of the input to solve basic problems approximately, including matrix multiplication, regression and low-rank approximation. The survey describes the key ideas and gives complete proofs of the main results in the field. A central unifying idea is sampling the columns (or rows) of a matrix according to their squared lengths.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":54},"references":42,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
