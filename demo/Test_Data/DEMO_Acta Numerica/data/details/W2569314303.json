This includes what we consider to be the basic methods, such as recurrence relations, series expansions (both convergent and asymptotic), and numerical quadrature. Several other methods are available and some of these will be discussed in less detail. Examples will be given on the use of special functions in certain problems from mathematical physics and mathematical statistics (integrals and series with special functions).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":19},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
