The classical shallow-water equations, the Saint-Venant system, were originally proposed about 150 years ago and still are used in a variety of applications. For many practical purposes, it is extremely important to have an accurate, efficient and robust numerical solver for the Saint-Venant system and related models. As their solutions are typically non-smooth and even discontinuous, finite-volume schemes are among the most popular tools. In this paper, we review such schemes and focus on one of the simplest (yet highly accurate and robust) methods: central-upwind schemes. These schemes belong to the family of Godunov-type Riemann-problem-solver-free central schemes, but incorporate some upwinding information about the local speeds of propagation, which helps to reduce an excessive amount of numerical diffusion typically present in classical (staggered) non-oscillatory central schemes. Besides the classical one- and two-dimensional Saint-Venant systems, we will consider the shallow-water equations with friction terms, models with moving bottom topography, the two-layer shallow-water system as well as general non-conservative hyperbolic systems.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":96},"references":162,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
