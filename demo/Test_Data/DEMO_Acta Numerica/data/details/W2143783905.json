The finite element schemes are introduced as discrete differential forms, matching the coordinate-independent statement of Maxwell's equations in the calculus of differential forms. The asymptotic convergence of discrete solutions is investigated theoretically. As discrete differential forms represent a genuine generalization of conventional Lagrangian finite elements, the analysis is based upon a judicious adaptation of established techniques in the theory of finite elements. Risks and difficulties haunting finite element schemes that do not fit the framework of discrete differential forms are highlighted.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":854},"references":115,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
