It finds its major application in the generation of meshes used in the simulation of physical processes. This paper connects the predominantly combinatorial work in classical computational geometry with the numerical interest in mesh generation. It focuses on the two- and three-dimensional case and covers results obtained during the twentieth century.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":97},"references":30,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
