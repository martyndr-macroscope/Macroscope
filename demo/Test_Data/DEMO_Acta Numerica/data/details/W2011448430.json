After an introduction to boundary integral equations, this review describes some of the methods which have been proposed for their approximate solution. It discusses, as simply as possible, some of the techniques used in their error analysis, and points to areas in which the theory is still unsatisfactory.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":83},"references":120,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
