In this paper we survey how this analysis is done via a number of examples. We precede this catalogue of examples with short primers on both condition numbers and probabilistic analyses.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":6},"references":56,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
