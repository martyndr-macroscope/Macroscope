Symplectic integrators are numerical methods specifically aimed at advancing in time the solution of Hamiltonian systems. Roughly speaking, ‘symplecticness’ is a characteristic property possessed by the solutions of Hamiltonian problems. A numerical method is called symplectic if, when applied to Hamiltonian problems, it generates numerical solutions which inherit the property of symplecticness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":380},"references":56,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
