We begin by describing a fundamental result in this area which states that stable, consistent and monotone schemes converge as the discretization parameter tends to zero. We review methodologies to construct finite difference, finite element and semi-Lagrangian schemes that satisfy these criteria, and, in addition, discuss some rather novel tools that have paved the way to derive rates of convergence within this framework.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":60},"references":155,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
