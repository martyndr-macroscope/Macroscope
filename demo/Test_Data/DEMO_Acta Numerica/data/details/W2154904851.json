The core of the material is presented in sufficient detail that the survey may serve as a text for teaching constrained global optimization. After giving motivations for and important examples of applications of global optimization, a precise problem definition is given, and a general form of the traditional first-order necessary conditions for a solution. Then more than a dozen software packages for complete global search are described. A quick review of incomplete methods for bound-constrained problems and recipes for their use in the constrained case follows; an explicit example is discussed, introducing the main techniques used within branch and bound techniques. Sections on interval arithmetic, constrained propagation and local optimization are followed by a discussion of how to avoid the cluster problem. Then a discussion of important problem transformations follows, in particular of linear, convex, and semilinear (= mixed integer linear) relaxations that are important for handling larger problems. Next, reliability issues – centring on rounding error handling and testing methodologies – are discussed, and the COCONUT framework for the integration of the different techniques is introduced. A list of challenges facing the field in the near future concludes the survey.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":420},"references":232,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
