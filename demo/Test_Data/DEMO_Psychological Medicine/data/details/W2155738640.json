This result was reflected in the scores on a self-reporting questionnaire. A control group showed little change over those years. The persistence of psychiatric problems was related to life experience, as measured by a life-event interview.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":34},"references":12,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
