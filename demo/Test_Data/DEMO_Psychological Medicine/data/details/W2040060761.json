A sample of 36 subjects, weighted with poor eyetrackers, was brought into the National Institute of Mental Health laboratory and retested on electro-oculogram and infrared tracking procedures. They were also administered psychological tests which assessed nine dimensions relevant to schizophrenic, neuropsychological, and affective disorders. In the area of schizophrenia-like symptoms , measures of attention deficits, stimulation avoidance, and identity problems predicted poor eyetracking for the whole sample. Using the poor eyetracking subjects alone ( N = 24), interpersonal withdrawal was also significantly related to poor performance but not stimulation avoidance. In the neuropsychological area , measures of attention control and perceptual-motor dysfunction for the total sample, and perceptual problems and general intellectual decrements for the poor eyetrackers were significantly related to poor performance. There was no relationship between measures of affective dysfunction and poor eyetracking.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":13},"references":104,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
