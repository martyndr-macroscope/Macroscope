Women who persisted in breastfeeding were less neurotic on the EPI but did not differ from artificial feeders in psychiatric history or sexuality before pregnancy. Breast feeders showed greater impairment of sexuality and slightly more depression at 3 months postpartum. These differences had largely disappeared at 6 months. Possible reasons for these negative effects of breast feeding are discussed and are likely to be multifactorial.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":93},"references":13,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
