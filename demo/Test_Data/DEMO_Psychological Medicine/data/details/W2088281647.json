A personal or family history of migration from the Caribbean is a major risk factor for psychosis; the consistency of this finding justifies a systematic evaluation of potential aetiological factors. Any hypothesis derived from the evidence so far must explain: increased incidence in first and second generation migrants; increased risk for all psychoses (including affective psychoses); and an effect specifically associated with a migration history from the Caribbean to Northern Europe.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":279},"references":0,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
