On each occasion respondents were rated as cognitively impaired, borderline impaired or unimpaired (using a brief information/orientation scale), with the validity of these ratings assessed in subsequent clinical interviews. Where follow-up screening was not possible, information was derived from death certificates and hospital case-notes. Over 8 years (1985–93) the overall incidence rate per person–year at risk was 1·58%, giving age-specific rates of 0·72, 1·32, 1·63, 3·46, 2·55 and 1·41% for the age groups 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, 85–89 and ≥ 90 respectively. Of 43 individuals classified at screening as borderline impaired in 1985 and 1989, 19 were diagnosed as demented at clinical interviews conducted within 16 weeks of screening. Four-year follow-ups among the remaining 24 showed that 15 had died, while 6 showed a worsened cognitive status. Controlling for both age and sex, aggregated 4-year mortality was significantly higher among those defined at screening in 1985 and 1989 as either impaired or borderline, when compared with the unimpaired.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":22},"references":30,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
