The screen results were compared with those found in a younger population drawn from the same area, and a similar rate of efficiency was found. However, in the adolescent age group the screen was more accurate at detecting true negative cases (specificity) but less able to identify true positive cases (sensitivity). Overall, the multiple criterion screen proved more efficient than a variety of single screen criteria, and the findings also suggest that certain screen measures used in adolescence may be more effective at identifying disturbed girls while others are more effective at identifying disturbed boys. This confirms the principle that the choice of screening instruments must be made with reference to their proposed use.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
