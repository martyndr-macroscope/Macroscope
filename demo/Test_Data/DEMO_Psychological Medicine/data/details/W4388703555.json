Whether neurofeedback (NF) directly targeting them is suited for treatment remains unclear. This study sought to determine feasibility and estimate effects of individualized, functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based real-time NF (rtfNIRS-NF) and high-beta electroencephalography-based NF (EEG-NF), assuming superiority over waitlist (WL). Methods Single-center, assessor-blinded feasibility study with randomization to rtfNIRS-NF, EEG-NF, or WL and assessments at baseline ( t 0), postassessment ( t 1), and 6-month follow-up ( t 2). NF comprised 12 60-min food-specific rtfNIRS-NF or EEG-NF sessions over 8 weeks. Primary outcome was the binge-eating frequency at t 1 assessed interview-based. Secondary outcomes included feasibility, eating disorder symptoms, mental and physical health, weight management-related behavior, executive functions, and brain activity at t 1 and t 2. Results In 72 patients (intent-to-treat), the results showed feasibility of NF regarding recruitment, attrition, adherence, compliance, acceptance, and assessment completion. Binge eating improved at t 1 by −8.0 episodes, without superiority of NF v. WL (−0.8 episodes, 95% CI −2.4 to 4.0), but with improved estimates in NF at t 2 relative to t 1. NF was better than WL for food craving, anxiety symptoms, and body mass index, but overall effects were mostly small. Brain activity changes were near zero. Conclusions The results show feasibility of food-specific rtfNIRS-NF and EEG-NF in BED, and no posttreatment differences v. WL, but possible continued improvement of binge eating. Confirmatory and mechanistic evidence is warranted in a double-blind randomized design with long-term follow-up, considering dose–response relationships and modes of delivery.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":11},"references":70,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
