Psychiatrists need to play a public mental health leadership role in increasing the coverage of mental health care through task shifting of effective interventions to non-specialist health workers. Psychiatrists' new roles should include designing and managing such programmes, building clinical capacity, supervision and quality assurance, providing referral pathways and research.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":225},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
