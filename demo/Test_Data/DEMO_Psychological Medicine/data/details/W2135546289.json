We tested whether social capital, measured at the neighbourhood level, was associated with the incidence of schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20). Method We administered a cross-sectional questionnaire on social capital to 5% of the adult population in 33 neighbourhoods (wards) in South London ( n =16 459). The questionnaire contained items relating to two social capital constructs: social cohesion and trust (SC&amp;T) and social disorganization (SocD). Schizophrenia incidence rates, estimated using data from the Aetiology and Ethnicity in Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses (AESOP) study, provided the outcome. We used multi-level Poisson regression to test our hypothesis while controlling for individual- and neighbourhood-level characteristics. Results We identified 148 cases during 565 576 person-years at-risk. Twenty-six per cent of the variation in incidence rates was attributable to neighbourhood-level characteristics. Response from the social capital survey was 25.7%. The association between SC&amp;T and schizophrenia was U-shaped. Compared with neighbourhoods with medial levels of SC&amp;T, incidence rates were significantly higher in neighbourhoods with low [incidence rates ratio (IRR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–3.3] and high (IRR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3–4.8) levels of SC&amp;T, independent of age, sex, ethnicity, ethnic density, ethnic fragmentation and socio-economic deprivation. Conclusion Neighbourhood variation in SC&amp;T was non-linearly associated with the incidence of schizophrenia within an urban area. Neighbourhoods with low SC&amp;T may fail to mediate social stress whereas high SC&amp;T neighbourhoods may have greater informal social control or may increase the risk of schizophrenia for residents excluded from accessing available social capital.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":12,"cited_by_count":145},"references":39,"networkCitations":12,"seed":false}
