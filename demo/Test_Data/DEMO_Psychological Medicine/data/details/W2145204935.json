Results showed memory deficits for old, alcohol intoxicated, and sleep deprived subjects in cued recall of weakly related pairs. In contrast, there were no differences between these three groups and a control group of young subjects in cued recall of strongly related pairs, and there were no differences between groups in priming. This pattern of results is interpreted to support (a) a hypothesis of functional similarities between the memory deficits associated with adult ageing, alcohol intoxication, and sleep deprivation; (b) the notion that memory deficits in these subjects are more likely to occur in tasks which require effortful rather than automatic processes; and (c) the view that the memory deficits observed are due to inefficiencies at both encoding and retrieval.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":48},"references":39,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
