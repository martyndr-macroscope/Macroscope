ESM is a structured diary technique recording real-time self-report data about the current mental state using a mobile application. We will review how ESM may contribute to (1) service user engagement and empowerment, (2) self-management and recovery, (3) goal direction in clinical assessment and management of care, and (4) shared decision-making. However, despite the evidence demonstrating the value of ESM-based approaches in enhancing person-centered mental health care, it is hardly integrated into clinical practice. Therefore, we propose a global research agenda for implementing ESM in routine mental health care addressing six key challenges: (1) the motivation and ability of service users to adhere to the ESM monitoring, reporting and feedback, (2) the motivation and competence of clinicians in routine healthcare delivery settings to integrate ESM in the workflow, (3) the technical requirements and (4) governance requirements for integrating these data in the clinical workflow, (5) the financial and competence related resources related to IT-infrastructure and clinician time, and (6) implementation studies that build the evidence-base. While focused on ESM, the research agenda holds broader implications for implementing digital innovations in mental health. This paper calls for a shift in focus from developing new digital interventions to overcoming implementation barriers, essential for achieving a true transformation toward person-centered care in mental health.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":12},"references":73,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
