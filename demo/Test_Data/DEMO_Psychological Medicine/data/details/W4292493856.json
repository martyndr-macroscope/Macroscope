However, it remains unknown how individuals adjust prosocial learning to avoid punishment or to pursue reward. Given that arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide that has been involved in modulating various social behaviors in mammals, it could be a crucial neurochemical facilitator that supports prosocial learning. Methods In 50 placebo controls and 54 participants with AVP administration, we examined the modulation of AVP on the prosocial learning characterized by reward and punishment framework, as well as its underlying neurocomputational mechanisms combining computational modeling, event-related potentials and oscillations. Results We found a self-bias that individuals learn to avoid punishment asymmetrically more severely than reward-seeking. Importantly, AVP increased behavioral performances and learning rates when making decisions to avoid losses for others and to obtain gains for self. These behavioral effects were underpinned by larger responses of stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) to anticipation, as well as higher punishment-related feedback-related negativity (FRN) for prosocial learning and reward-related P300 for proself benefits, while FRN and P300 neural processes were integrated into theta (4–7 Hz) oscillation at the outcome evaluation stage. Conclusions These results suggest that AVP context-dependently up-regulates altruism for concerning others' losses and reward-seeking for self-oriented benefits. Our findings provide insight into the selectively modulatory roles of AVP in prosocial behaviors depending on learning contexts between proself reward-seeking and prosocial punishment-avoidance.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":87,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
