TCT can be effective in enhancing neurocognition and function in schizophrenia, but such gains require significant time and effort and elude many patients. Methods As a strategy to increase and/or accelerate TCT-induced clinical gains, we tested the dose- and time-course effects of the pro-attentional drug, amphetamine (AMPH; placebo, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg po; within-subject double-blind, order balanced) on auditory learning in schizophrenia patients [ n = 32; M:F = 19:13; age 42.0 years (24–55)]. To understand predictors and/or mechanisms of AMPH-enhanced TCT, we also measured auditory fidelity (words-in-noise (WIN), quick speech-in-noise (QuickSIN)) and neurocognition (MATRICS comprehensive cognitive battery (MCCB)). Some measures were also acquired from age-matched healthy subjects (drug free; n = 10; M:F = 5:5). Results Patients exhibited expected deficits in neurocognition. WIN and QuickSIN performance at low signal intensities was impaired in patients with low v. high MCCB attention/vigilance (A/V) scores; these deficits were corrected by AMPH, maximally at 2.5–5 mg ( d 's = 0.79–1.29). AMPH also enhanced auditory learning, with maximal effects at 5 mg ( d = 0.93), and comparable effects 60 and 210 min post pill. ‘Pro-learning’ effects of AMPH and AMPH-induced gains in auditory fidelity were most evident in patients with low MCCB A/V scores. Conclusions These findings advance our understanding of the impact of pro-attentional interventions on auditory information processing and suggest dose- and time-course parameters for studies that assess the ability of AMPH to enhance the clinical benefits of TCT in schizophrenia patients.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":7},"references":48,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
