Previous studies highlight a relationship between poor self-regulation and onset of eating pathology. In this study, we investigated whether this association is mediated by decision-making difficulties. Methods To test this hypothesis, we used data from the Millennium Cohort Study. Decision-making performance was assessed with the Cambridge Gambling Task at age 11. Principal components analysis was used to derive an index of ED symptoms at age 14. The trajectories of scores of two subscales of the Child Social Behaviour Questionnaire, Independence and Self-Regulation (ISR) and Emotional Dysregulation (EmotDy), were modelled from ages 3 to 7 years in a latent growth curve analysis. The individual predicted values of the intercept (set at baseline, 3 years) and the slope (rate of annual change) were then used in the mediation analysis. Results In our sample of 11 303 individuals, there was evidence for mediation by three measures of decision-making at age 11 (poor quality of decision-making, delay aversion and low risk-adjustment) in the association between EmotDy across ages 3–7 and ED symptoms at age 14 even after the adjustment for relevant covariates. We found no evidence of association between ISR and ED symptoms. Conclusion Our findings suggest that emotion regulation processes during childhood may be relevant for the future onset of ED symptoms via their association with decision-making skills. These findings, obtained from a large, representative, sample, shed light on the relationship between self-regulation, decision-making and symptoms of EDs.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":11},"references":44,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
