Environmental pathways (family functioning, non-kinship care, maltreatment) were specified as potential mediators of PCE. Methods Participants were 372 (190 PCE; 47% male), primarily Black, low socioeconomic status, enrolled at birth. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed using Youth Self-Report at ages 12 and 15 and Adult Self-Report at age 21. Extended random-intercept cross-lagged panel modeling was used to account for potential bidirectional relationships between internalizing and externalizing behaviors over time, examining potential mediators. Results Adjusting for covariates, significant indirect effects were found for each mediator at different ages. For family functioning, these were both internalizing ( β = 0.83, p = 0.04) and externalizing behaviors ( β = 1.58, p = 0.02) at age 12 and externalizing behaviors at age 15 ( β = 0.51, p = 0.03); for non-kinship care, externalizing behaviors at ages 12 ( β = 0.63, p = 0.02) and 15 ( β = 0.20, p = 0.03); and for maltreatment, both internalizing and externalizing behaviors at ages 15 ( β = 0.64, p = 0.02 for internalizing; β = 0.50, p = 0.03 for externalizing) and 21 ( β = 1.39, p = 0.01 for internalizing; β = 1.11, p = 0.01 for externalizing). Direct associations of PCE with internalizing and externalizing behaviors were not observed, nor cross-lagged relationships between internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Conclusions Negative associations of PCE with behavioral adjustment persist into EA via environmental pathways, specifying intervention points to disrupt adverse pathways toward healthy development.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":70,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
