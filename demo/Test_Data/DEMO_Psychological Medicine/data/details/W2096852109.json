The present study investigates compositional and improvisational skills in five idiots-savants. The findings are interpreted as indicating that a representational system of musical rules and structures is accessible to persons of low general intelligence, and that such a system may underlie reproductive as well as generative musical capacity.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":57},"references":19,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
