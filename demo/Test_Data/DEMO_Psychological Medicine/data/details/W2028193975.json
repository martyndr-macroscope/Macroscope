The original case material was coded in terms of Present State Examination syndromes and analysed statistically for internal consistency and discrimination between the two diagnostic entities. Kraepelin's DP and MDI were found to define homogeneous groups of disorders which could be clearly distinguished from one another. A CATEGO re-classification of the cases revealed an 80·2% concordance rate between Kraepelin's diagnoses and ICD-9. Cluster analysis of the original data reproduced closely Kraepelin's dichotomous classification of the psychoses but suggested that DP was a narrower concept than schizophrenia today, while MDI was a composite group including both ‘typical’ manic-depressive illnesses and schizoaffective disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":75},"references":27,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
