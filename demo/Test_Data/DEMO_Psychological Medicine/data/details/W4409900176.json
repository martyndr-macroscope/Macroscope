We also evaluate potential moderating effects of other risk factors and whether substance misuse signals increased risk of transitioning from thinking about to attempting suicide. Method US Army veterans and deactivated reservists ( N = 6,811) completed surveys in 2016–2018 (T1) and 2018–2019 (T2). Weights-adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate the associations of binge drinking, smoking/vaping, cannabis use, prescription drug abuse, illicit drug use, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and drug use disorder (DUD) at T1 with suicide ideation, plan, and attempt at T2. Interaction models tested for moderation of these associations by sex, depression, and recency of separation/deactivation. Suicide attempt models were also fit in the subgroup with ideation at T1 ( n = 1,527). Results In models controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and prior suicidality, binge drinking, cannabis use, prescription drug abuse, illicit drug use, and AUD were associated with subsequent suicidal ideation (AORs = 1.42–2.60, p s &lt; .01). Binge drinking, AUD, and DUD were associated with subsequent suicide plan (AORs = 1.23–1.95, p s &lt; .05). None of the substance use variables had a main effect on suicide attempt; however, interaction models suggested certain types of drug use predicted attempts among those without depression. Additionally, the effects of smoking/vaping and AUD differed by sex. Substance misuse did not predict the transition from ideation to attempt. Conclusions Alcohol and drug misuse are associated with subsequent suicidal behaviors in this population. Awareness of differences across sex and depression status may inform suicide risk assessment.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":46,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
