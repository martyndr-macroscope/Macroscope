It is relevant to a broad range of ages, levels and types of disability and care provided; and, in assessing health and well-being, to both caregivers and non-caregivers. Scales, including both positive and negative dimensions, have demonstrated good internal consistency on two occasions. The instrument is potentially useful in a range of research and practical settings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":86},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
