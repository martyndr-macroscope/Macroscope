Significantly higher incidence of Grade 3–4 CSP (moderate to large) compared with the controls was found only in the schizophrenics. When a broader interpretation of CSP, including indeterminant (Grade 1) and small (Grade 2) CSP was used, three additional patients with bipolar disorder were found to have Grade 1–2 CSP, and the total prevalence of Grade 1–4 CSP in the patients with bipolar disorder was significantly higher than that in the control subjects but slightly lower than that in the schizophrenic patients. CSP was not observed in any patient with major depression. There were no differences between the patients with and without CSP in age, sex, education, or the duration of illness. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neurodevelopmental abnormality may be present in schizophrenia, and such an abnormality may also be present in some patients with bipolar disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":65},"references":15,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
