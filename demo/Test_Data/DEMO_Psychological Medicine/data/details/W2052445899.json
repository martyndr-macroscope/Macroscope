Explicit memory tested by both recognition and recall was unimpaired. In contrast, implicit memory was significantly impaired in primigravidae. Impairment in implicit memory correlated with the subjective memory ratings. The dissociation of explicit and implicit memory is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":98},"references":23,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
