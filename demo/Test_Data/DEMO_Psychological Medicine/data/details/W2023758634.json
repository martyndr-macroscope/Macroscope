However, it did show that patients' level of social functioning was related to their level of insight, and to how well they coped with the prodromes of mania and whether they could detect prodromes of depression. The results suggest that it is worth exploring ways of teaching patients to monitor their moods and to promote insight and good strategies for coping with their prodromes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":173},"references":12,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
