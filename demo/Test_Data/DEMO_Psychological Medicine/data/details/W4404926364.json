While the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear, early CP have also been linked with peer victimization and internalizing problems. The goals of the current study were: (1) to examine peer victimization and internalizing problems as potential serial mediators explaining increased medical and psychiatric service use in adolescents with a history of childhood CP, and; (2) to explore whether the proposed mediation models vary by sex. Methods Participants ( N = 744; 53% boys, Mage = 8.39 years) from an ongoing longitudinal study that began in 2008 in Québec, Canada were recruited and assessed for CP, service use, and other behaviours via self-, parent- and teacher-reported questionnaires. Serial mediation analyses were conducted to examine the effects of peer victimization and internalizing problems on the association between childhood CP and adolescent medical and psychiatric service use, controlling for sex and household income. Results Adolescents with childhood CP reported higher medical and psychiatric service use than non-CP peers. Peer victimization and internalizing problems significantly mediated this association in both general medical and psychiatric service use models. The models did not vary by sex. Conclusions Findings support higher levels of service use in adolescents with a history of CP, mediated by peer victimization and internalizing problems. Specifically, results highlight the importance of examining peer and socioemotional factors that may explain the increased service usage observed among youth with CP, to support better health outcomes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":46,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
