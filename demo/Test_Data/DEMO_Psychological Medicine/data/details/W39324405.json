A PREDICTION EQUATION FOR THE ULTIMATE PUNCHING SHEAR RESISTANCE OF PERFORATED SLABS IS PRESENTED. THIS IS BASED ON STUDYING THE BEHAVIOR OF VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF HOLE SIZE, SHAPE, NUMBER, AND LOCATION. THE PROPOSED EQUATION IS A SIMPLIFIED, LOWER BOUND DESIGN EQUATION SUITABLE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF STRESS VALUES. /ACI/","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
