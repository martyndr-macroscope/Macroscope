Despite a similar percentage weight loss the reduction in plasma tryptophan was greater in women than men. In addition, only in women was dieting associated with increased prolactin secretion following intravenous tryptophan, a measure of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) function. These results suggest that dieting reduces the availability of circulating tryptophan for brain 5-HT synthesis. Women appear more vulnerable than men both to this effect and to its consequences for brain 5-HT function. Altered brain 5-HT function may play a part in some of the psychological consequences of dieting, including the development of clinical eating disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":162},"references":39,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
