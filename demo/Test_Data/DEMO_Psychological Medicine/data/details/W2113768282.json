The data for the efficacy of intervention programmes are reviewed. The evidence relating to the benefits gained by patients is equivocal. The indication is that a selective rather than a blanket service is needed, with the target for intervention being patients at high risk for psychological morbidity. The advantages of one type of support over another remain unproven.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":96},"references":35,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
