Methods N = 4,664 male participants from a UK birth cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children – ALSPAC). Seven indicators of pubertal timing were measured repeatedly from 7 to 17 years (age at: peak height velocity, peak weight velocity, peak bone mineral content velocity, Tanner stage 3 pubic hair, Tanner stage 3 genitalia, axillary hair, and voice break), categorised into ‘early’, ‘on-time,’ and ‘late’ (mean ± 1 SD). Depressive symptoms (binary variable indicating higher versus lower levels) were assessed at 14 and 18 years, and depression (ICD-10 diagnosis) was assessed at 18 years. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between each indicator of pubertal timing and depressive symptoms/depression, adjusted for socioeconomic status (SES) and prepubertal body mass index (BMI). Results Compared to males with normative pubertal development, the odds of depression at age 18 were higher in those with early age at peak height velocity (OR: 2.06; 95% CI 1.27–3.34), early age at peak weight velocity (OR: 2.10; 95% CI 1.16–3.79), and early age at Tanner genitalia stage 3 (OR: 1.81; 95% CI 1.01–3.26). There was no evidence for associations between pubertal timing and depressive symptoms at age 14 or 18. Conclusions We found evidence that males with an earlier pubertal timing had increased odds of depression at age 18. Early maturing boys could be targeted for interventions aimed at preventing depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":52,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
