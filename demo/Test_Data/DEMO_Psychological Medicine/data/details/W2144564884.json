Ratings based on subject and informant accounts using the APFA were compared. There was good agreement for estimates of levels of dysfunction, and moderate agreement for type of dysfunction. An anticipated under-reporting of difficulties by subjects was not found. The extent of personality dysfunction was predictive of whether a close informant was available; however, closeness of informant was not consistently associated with subject–informant agreement.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":29},"references":19,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
