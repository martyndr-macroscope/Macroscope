Their scores on a subscaled version of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (the DAS-24) were compared. The DAS total scores mirrored previous findings in that the total scores for recovered individuals returned to normal or near-normal levels. However, the dependency subscale scores remained elevated for the recovered depressed group. It is proposed that these results support the conclusion that self-report measures of cognitive vulnerability should focus on specific rather than global effects, if progress is to be made in the search for true vulnerability factors.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":38},"references":41,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
