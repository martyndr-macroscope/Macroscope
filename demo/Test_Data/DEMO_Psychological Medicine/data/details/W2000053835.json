Cronbach's α ranged from 0·92 to 0·94 for the total sample and from 0·76 to 0·82 for those with current depression. Item total correlations, as well as several tests of concurrent and discriminant validity are reported. Factor analysis revealed three dimensions (cognitive/mood, anxiety/arousal and vegetative) for each scale. Analysis of sensitivity to change in symptom severity in an open-label trial of fluoxetine ( N = 58) showed that the IDS-C and IDS-SR were highly related to the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Given the more complete item coverage, satisfactory psychometric properties, and high correlations with the above standard ratings, the 30-item IDS-C and IDS-SR can be used to evaluate depressive symptom severity. The availability of similar item content for clinician-rated and self-reported versions allows more direct evaluations of these two perspectives.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":61,"cited_by_count":2127},"references":32,"networkCitations":61,"seed":false}
