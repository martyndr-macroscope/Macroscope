Large differences in both rates and methods of suicide were found in individual migrant groups. The rates were more akin to those in the country of origin than of the Australian-born, no matter how long the migrants had lived in Australia. By contrast, methods of suicide used by migrants approached more closely those of the Australian-born the longer they had lived in Australia. The change in methods used was greatest in those migrant groups coming from countries with a language and culture more akin to those in Australia. A discussion follows of various possible sociological and cultural factors, both within the countries of origin and within Australia, which could have contributed to these results.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":50},"references":30,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
