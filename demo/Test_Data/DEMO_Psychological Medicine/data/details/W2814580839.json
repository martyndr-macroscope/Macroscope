The aim of the study was to investigate the utility of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as a harm reduction intervention in this population. Method Fifty tobacco smokers with a psychotic disorder were enrolled onto a 24-week pilot study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02212041) investigating the efficacy of a 6-week free e-cigarette intervention to reduce smoking. Cigarette and e-cigarette use was self-reported at weekly visits, and verified using carbon monoxide tests. Psychopathology, e-cigarette acceptability and adverse effects were assessed using standardised scales. Results There was a significant (⩾50%) reduction in cigarettes consumed per day between baseline and week 6 [ F (2.596,116.800) = 25.878, p &lt; 0.001], and e-cigarette use was stable during this period [ F (2.932,46.504) = 2.023, p = 0.115]. These changes were verified by significant carbon monoxide reductions between these time points [ F (3.335,126.633) = 5.063, p = 0.002]. Conclusions The provision of e-cigarettes is a potentially useful harm reduction intervention in smokers with a psychotic disorder.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":46},"references":37,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
