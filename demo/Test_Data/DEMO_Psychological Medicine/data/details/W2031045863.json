We evaluated a manualized psychodynamic therapy (PDT) for adolescents with these co-morbid disorders. Method In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 66 adolescents diagnosed with mixed disorders of conduct and emotions (F92 in ICD-10) were randomly assigned to a manualized in-patient PDT group or a waiting list/treatment-as-usual (WL/TAU) control condition. Diagnoses according to DSM-IV were also documented. Patients were compared using rates of remission as the primary outcome. The Global Severity Index (GSI) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were used as secondary measures. Assessments were performed at baseline, post-treatment and at the 6-month follow-up. Results The sample consisted of severely impaired adolescents with high rates of further co-morbid disorders and academic failure. Patients in the treatment group had a significantly higher rate of remission [odds ratio (OR) 26.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.42–108.55, p &lt; 0.001]. Compared with the control group, the PDT group resulted in significantly better outcomes on the SDQ ( p = 0.04) but not the GSI ( p = 0.18), with small between-group effect sizes (SDQ: d = 0.38, GSI: d = 0.18). However, the scores of patients treated with PDT were post-treatment no longer significantly different from normative data on the GSI and within the normal range on the SDQ. The effects in the treatment group were stable at follow-up. Furthermore, most patients were reintegrated into educational processes. Conclusion PDT led to remarkable improvement and furthered necessary preconditions for long-term stabilization. In future, PDT should be compared to other strong active treatments.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":35},"references":53,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
