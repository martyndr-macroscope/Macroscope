For the 82 cases, death certificates were obtained and coroners' inquest reports sought. The victims were predominantly young single men or older married women; both groups had strong psychiatric histories; and there were no suicides which had political overtones, apart from the index case. Compared with suicides by this method in the past, a higher proportion of victims were born in the UK. It is proposed that a code of practice for the reporting of suicides by the media is required.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":78},"references":7,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
