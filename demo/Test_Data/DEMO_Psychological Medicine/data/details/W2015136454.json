They were interviewed on two occasions several days apart. Overall reliability of diagnosis ranged from K = 0·55 (conduct disorder) to 1·0 (substance abuse or dependence). In general, reliability for scale scores of psychopathology was somewhat lower in out-patients than in-patients, though the opposite was the case for anxiety disorders and psychosocial incapacity and the reliability of the diagnosis of conduct disorder – the only individual diagnosis sufficiently common to permit this comparison. Unreliability of reports of behavioural problems was found to be related to admitting to being a liar in the first interview. The implications of these results for the use of the CAPA are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":272},"references":14,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
