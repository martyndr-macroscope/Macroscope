Four versions of Sternberg's memory comparison task were used. Unipolar depressives showed impaired memory scanning in 3 of the tasks compared with controls, and in one task compared with patients with anxiety states. They were also slower than the other patients and controls in the non-scanning processing stages. They seemed to adopt a less efficient search strategy, and showed more controlled processing as opposed to automatic detection in a paper-and-pencil version of the task.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":125},"references":32,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
