Almost equal proportions of neurotics and non-neurotics had experienced a single stressful event. Significantly more neurotics than non-neurotics had suffered multiple stressful events. An analysis of the multiple events revealed that many were related and involved a single calamity. For multiple unrelated stressful events no significant difference was found between neurotic and non-neurotic depressions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":42},"references":49,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
