The first (‘chloro-anaemia’) was a form of hypochromic anaemia possibly associated with gastric ulceration and poor diet. This form predominated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The second (‘chloro-anorexia’) was a disorder of psychogenic origin resembling, but not identical to, anorexia nervosa. The latter form predominated in earlier periods but also occurred throughout the nineteenth century; it was also known as ‘the virgin's disease’ or ‘febris amatoria’. The ‘green’ of‘;green-sickness’ may originally have indicated innocence rather than a green colour of the skin.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":30},"references":36,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
