It has always been possible to employ physical methods of treatment for punitive ends, against which the introduction of liberal policies is no complete safeguard. Indulging one's personal animosities towards a difficult or violent patient has always been condemned, but the motives of a psychiatrist may be particularly easily misconstrued. These inherent risks in a psychiatrist's situation are illustrated by a case from the 19th century.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":28,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
