Significantly more patients in each group than controls showed abnormal activation of transketolase, not only by 0·3 mM thiamin diphosphate (TDP) but also in further activation by increase to 3 mM. This indicated the presence in a proportion of the alcoholic and the demented patients of an abnormal enzyme variant, similar to that previously found in vitro . The modified transketolase activation test may warn not only of marginal thiamin deficiency but also independently, of susceptibility to brain damage in patients at risk.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":28},"references":30,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
