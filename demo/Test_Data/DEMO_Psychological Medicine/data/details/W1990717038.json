Tyrosine and homovanillic acid (precursor and metabolite respectively of dopamine) were also determined. Results suggest an association between affective state and the above precursor amino acids with lower concentrations in primary depression and higher ones when anxiety or agitation predominate. This leads to lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in depression and higher concentrations in anxiety and agitation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":44},"references":31,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
