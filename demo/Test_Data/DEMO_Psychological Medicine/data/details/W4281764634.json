Emerging evidence suggests that interventions designed to target and isolate one key change mechanism may also produce meaningful change in core symptoms. Although both ‘broad’ and ‘focused’ digital programs have demonstrated efficacy, no study has performed a direct, head-to-head comparison of the two approaches. We addressed this through a randomized non-inferiority trial. Method Participants with recurrent binge eating were randomly assigned to a broad ( n = 199) or focused digital intervention ( n = 199), or a waitlist ( n = 202). The broad program targeted dietary restraint, mood intolerance, and body image disturbances, while the focused program exclusively targeted dietary restraint. Primary outcomes were eating disorder psychopathology and binge eating frequency. Results In intention-to-treat analyses, both intervention groups reported greater improvements in primary and secondary outcomes than the waitlist, which were sustained at an 8-week follow-up. The focused intervention was not inferior to the broad intervention on all but one outcome, but was associated with higher rates of attrition and non-compliance. Conclusion Focused digital interventions that are designed to target one key change mechanism may produce comparable symptom improvements to broader digital interventions, but appear to be associated with lower engagement.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":24},"references":40,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
