This process enables individuals to comprehend and anticipate social behaviors in a more intuitive manner. Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia frequently demonstrate deficits in this domain, which contribute to impaired social functioning. The present meta-analysis aims to assess the extent of spontaneous mentalizing impairments in schizophrenia. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in four prominent databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science. Following the review of the retrieved records and subsequent citation searching, a total of 15 studies were selected for inclusion in the quantitative synthesis. The data of 526 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 536 controls were subjected to analysis. Effect sizes for intentionality and appropriateness were computed utilizing weighted or standardized mean differences, and heterogeneity was evaluated. Results Patients with schizophrenia exhibited substantial impairments in intentionality and appropriateness during mentalizing tasks, with large effect sizes. No significant differences were observed in random movement tasks, although patients also demonstrated deficits in interpreting goal-directed movements. Furthermore, high heterogeneity in some outcomes and variability in study methodologies were also noted. Conclusions This analysis corroborates substantial spontaneous mentalizing deficits in schizophrenia, underscoring their potential role in impaired social functioning. In conjunction with previous analyses, the present findings emphasize the pervasive nature of mentalizing deficits in schizophrenia, encompassing explicit, implicit, and spontaneous dimensions. These results hold significant implications for therapeutic strategies designed to augment social cognition in individuals with schizophrenia.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":67,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
