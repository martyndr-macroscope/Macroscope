There is evidence that shame has trauma-like characteristics, suggesting it can be understood within the same conceptual framework as trauma and dissociation. Evidence for causal links among trauma, dissociation, and psychosis thus warrant the investigation of how shame may influence causal mechanisms for psychosis symptoms. Methods This study tested the interaction between dissociation and shame, specifically external shame (feeling shamed by others), in predicting psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) six months later in a general population sample ( N = 314). It also tested if social safeness moderates these effects. A longitudinal, online questionnaire design tested a moderation model (dissociation-shame) and a moderated moderation model (adding social safeness), using multiple regressions with bootstrap procedures. Results Although there was no direct effect of dissociation on PLEs six months later, there was a significant interaction effect with shame, controlling for PLEs at baseline. There were complex patterns in the directions of effects: For high-shame-scorers, higher dissociation predicted higher PLE scores, but for low-shame-scorers, higher dissociation predicted lower PLE scores. Social safeness was found to significantly moderate these interaction effects, which were unexpectedly more pronounced in the context of higher social safeness. Conclusions The results demonstrate evidence for an interaction between dissociation and shame on its impact on PLEs, which manifests particularly for those experiencing higher social safeness. This suggests a potential role of social mechanisms in both the etiology and treatment of psychosis, which warrants further testing in clinical populations.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":3},"references":32,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
