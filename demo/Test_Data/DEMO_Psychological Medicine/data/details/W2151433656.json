This will lead on to the pathways by which the genetic factors also appear to control stressful life events in adolescence and adult life, and then to a consideration of causes that are entirely environmental. We will conclude by considering the causes of the gender differences in the prevalence of depression during adult life.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":67},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
