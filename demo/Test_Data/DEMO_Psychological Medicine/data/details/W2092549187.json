This hypothesis is tested using a neuroendocrine probe approach with the challenge drug pyridostigmine, an indirect cholinergic agent thought to release growth hormone (GH) by decreasing inhibitory somatostatin tone. The consequent increments in plasma GH were considered to reflect central acetylcholine responsivity. Fifty-four volunteers were tested: 27 DSM-III-R major depressives (18 women and 9 men) and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Subjects were cannulated at 9.00 h following an overnight fast and two baseline samples were taken at 15 min intervals. Pyridostigmine 120 mg was administered orally and thereafter samples were taken at the time points +60, +90, +120 and +180 min. GH responses were significantly greater in depressives than controls and this effect was more marked for men than women. These results support the proposal that muscarinic upregulation and/or supersensitivity is associated with depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":38},"references":45,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
