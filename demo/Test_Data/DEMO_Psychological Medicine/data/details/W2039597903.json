Prior research with racially/ethnically homogeneous samples has demonstrated widespread co-occurrence of psychotic experiences (PEs) and common mental health conditions, particularly multi-morbidity, suggesting that psychosis may be related to the overall severity of psychiatric disorder rather than any specific subtype. In this study we aimed to examine whether PEs are associated with the presence of specific disorders or multi-morbidity of co-occurring disorders across four large racially/ethnically diverse samples of adults in the USA. Method. Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) and separately from the Asian and Latino subsamples of the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS). Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between PEs and individual subtypes of DSM-IV disorder, and to test for a linear dose–response relationship between the number of subtypes and PEs. Results. Prevalence of PEs was moderately greater among individuals with each subtype of disorder in each data set [odds ratios (ORs) 1.8–3.8], although associations were only variably significant when controlling for clinical and demographic variables. However, the sum of disorder subtypes was related to odds for PEs in a linear dose–response fashion across all four samples. Conclusions. PEs are related primarily to the extent or severity of psychiatric illness, as indicated by the presence of multiple psychiatric disorders, rather than to any particular subtype of disorder in these data. This relationship applies to the general population and across diverse racial/ethnic groups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":18,"cited_by_count":103},"references":49,"networkCitations":18,"seed":false}
