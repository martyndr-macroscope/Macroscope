Single studies usually have limited statistical power or may be difficult to interpret or generalize and so the findings from a single study can rarely justify a change in clinical practice or in an aetiological theory. Even when planning larger studies or mega-trials (Yusuf et al. 1984), a thorough review of existing literature is needed and the results of the study need to be placed in that context, though single studies can exert an important and powerful influence.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":31},"references":28,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
