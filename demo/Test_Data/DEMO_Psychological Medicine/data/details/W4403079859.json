There is however, limited knowledge about the longitudinal course of this relationship. Methods Systemic inflammation (C-Reactive Protein, CRP) and cognition (nine cognitive domains) was measured from baseline to 1 year follow-up in first treatment SZ and BD ( n = 221), and healthy controls (HC, n = 220). Linear mixed models were used to evaluate longitudinal changes separately in CRP and cognitive domains specific to diagnostic status (SZ, BD, HC). Hierarchical clustering was applied on the entire sample to investigate the longitudinal course of transdiagnostic inflammatory-cognitive subgroups. Results There were no case-control differences or change in CRP from baseline to follow-up. We confirm previous observations of case-control differences in cognition at both time-points and domain specific stability/improvement over time regardless of diagnostic status. We identified transdiagnostic inflammatory-cognitive subgroups at baseline with differing demographics and clinical severity. Despite improvement in cognition, symptoms and functioning, the higher inflammation – lower cognition subgroup (75% SZ; 48% BD; 38% HC) had sustained inflammation and lower cognition, more symptoms, and lower functioning (SMI only) at follow-up. This was in comparison to a lower inflammation – higher cognition subgroup (25% SZ, 52% BD, 62% HC), where SMI participants showed cognitive functioning at HC level with a positive clinical course. Conclusions Our findings support heterogenous and transdiagnostic inflammatory-cognitive subgroups that are stable over time, and may benefit from targeted interventions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":2},"references":111,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
