W. Kosterlitz retired from the Chair of Pharmacology. The formation of the unit was made possible by the provision of sufficient laboratory and office space by the university, by the continuing support from the U.S. Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence, and a new substantial grant from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention), now provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":6,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
