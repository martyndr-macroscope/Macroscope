However, these patterns are disrupted by aging and psychiatric conditions. This study aims to investigate how fractal patterns vary across the sleep–wake cycle, differ based on individuals' recency of depression diagnosis, and change before and after a depressive episode. Methods Using actigraphy from two cohorts ( n = 378), we examined fractal motor activity patterns both between individuals without depression and with varying recencies of depression and within individuals before and after depressive symptom recurrence. To evaluate fractal patterns, we quantified temporal correlations in motor activity fluctuations across different time scales using a scaling exponent, α . Linear mixed models were utilized to assess the influence of the sleep–wake cycle, (recency of) depression, and their interaction on α . Results Fractal activity patterns in all individuals varied across the sleep–wake cycle, showing stronger temporal correlations during wakefulness (larger α = 1.035 ± 0.003) and more random activity fluctuations during sleep (smaller α = 0.784 ± 0.004, p &lt; 0.001). This sleep–wake difference was reduced in recently depressed individuals (1–6 months), leading to larger α during sleep (0.836 ± 0.017), compared to currently depressed (0.781 ± 0.018, p = 0.006), remitted (0.776 ± 0.014, p &lt; 0.001), and never-depressed individuals (0.773 ± 0.016, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, remitted individuals who experienced depressive symptom recurrence during antidepressant tapering exhibited a larger α during sleep after the symptom onset as compared to before (after: α = 0.703 ± 0.022; before: α = 0.680 ± 0.022; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions These findings suggest a link between fractal motor activity patterns during sleep and depressive symptom recurrence in remitted individuals and those with recent depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":53,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
