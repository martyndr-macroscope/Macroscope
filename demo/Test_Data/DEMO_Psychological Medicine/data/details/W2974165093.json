Methods Studies were identified through a systematic literature search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Web of Science through January 2018. Twenty-two publications met inclusion criteria (total N = 61 985). Two random effects meta-analyses were conducted: (1) to identify the proportion of children and adolescents with ADHD that met criteria for ASD; and (2) to compare the severity of dimensionally-measured ASD symptomology in children and adolescents with and without ADHD. Results The overall pooled effect for children and adolescents with ADHD who met threshold for ASD was 21%. There was no significant difference between community samples (19%) and clinical samples (24%) or between US studies v. those from other countries. Children and adolescents with ADHD had substantially more dimensionally-measured ASD traits compared with those who did not have ADHD ( d = 1.23). Conclusion The findings provide further evidence that ADHD and ASD are associated in nature. Clinical and research implications are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":94},"references":125,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
