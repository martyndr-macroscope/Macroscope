This review considers the associations between serotonergic and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) systems. We follow the standpoint of a previous Editorial Review (Bhagwagar &amp; Cowen, Psychological Medicine 2008, 38 , 307–313) and consider another possible mechanism of vulnerability to depressive disorder, that is we suggest that the gene×environment interaction involves complex participation of serotonergic genes modulating response to stress through the HPA system.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":56},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
