However, few studies have explored affect dynamics in individuals in remission from depression, and results have been mixed. Methods A community sample of 18-year-olds ( N = 345) completed diagnostic interviews and EMA probing emotions and low interest/motivation 5× daily for 2 weeks. Affect home base, variability, and inertia were compared across currently depressed, remitted, and never-depressed groups. Results Both depression groups had a higher negative affect (NA) and low interest/motivation home base, lower positive affect (PA) home base, greater variability of NA, PA, and low interest/motivation, and greater NA and low interest/motivation inertia than never-depressed participants. Additionally, the currently depressed group had a higher sad home base specifically, greater variability across most negative emotions and low interest/motivation, and greater low interest/motivation inertia than the remitted group. The currently depressed and remitted groups did not differ in anxious, upset, or PA home base, anxious or PA variability, and inertia of all negative emotions and PA. Conclusions Findings suggest that a number of abnormalities in emotion and reward functioning persist after a depressive episode resolves, however, the tendency to experience higher levels of sadness, greater range of a variety of negative emotions, and more variable and persistent low interest/motivation are exacerbated during depressive episodes. Conversely, greater intensity and persistence of some negative emotions (anxiety, upset) and blunted positive emotions appear to equally characterize depression in both the symptomatic and remitted state.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":5},"references":39,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
