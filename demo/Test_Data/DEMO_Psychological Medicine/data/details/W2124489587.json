This study aimed to investigate the association between high CRP concentration and depression while taking physical health into account. Method A cross-sectional study of a community-dwelling sample of 5438 men aged 70+. Participants with scores ⩾7 on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) were considered to display clinically significant depressive symptoms. We measured the serum concentration of CRP with a high-sensitivity assay. The assessment of physical co-morbidity included three components: the Charlson weighted index, self-report of major health events on a standardized questionnaire, and the physical component of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Other measured factors included age, native language, education, a standardized socio-economic index, smoking, prior or current history of depression treatment, cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score &lt;24) and body mass index (BMI). Results Participants with depression ( n =340) were older than their controls without depression (age in years: 76·6±4·4 v . 75·4±4·1). Men with CRP concentration &gt;3 mg/l had an increased odds ratio (OR) [1·59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·20–2·11] of being depressed compared to men with CRP ⩽3 mg/l. This association became non-significant once we adjusted the analysis for the measures of physical co-morbidity and other confounding factors (OR 1·22, 95% CI 0·86–1·73). Conclusions The physiological mechanisms that lead to the onset and maintenance of depressive symptoms in older men remain to be determined, but CRP concentration is unlikely to play a significant role in that process.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":54},"references":39,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
