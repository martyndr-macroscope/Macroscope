The contrast is sharpest for those suffering from dementia who are much more likely to receive neuroleptic medication than their counterparts in London. Analysis indicates that the differences may reflect the greater emphasis in New York on the nursing-medical model of care, rather than any differences between the residents themselves.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":26},"references":16,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
