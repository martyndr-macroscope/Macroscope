Previous findings that depressed patients experience high frequency intrusive memories were confirmed, as was an association between intrusive memories of childhood abuse and severity of depression. Patients reported intrusive memories for a variety of other events, particularly involving illness and death. Limited support was obtained for the hypotheses that the course of depression would be related to the activation of negative memories, and that immediate life events would trigger the activation of memories of similar events from the past.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":118},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
