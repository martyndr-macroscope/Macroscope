Lateral, third and fourth ventricles and cerebral density numbers were measured. In the schizophrenic patients there was a significant increase in third ventricle width. Ventricular Brain Ratio (VBR) and there were significantly higher densities of white matter in the right frontal and parietal region.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":15},"references":31,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
