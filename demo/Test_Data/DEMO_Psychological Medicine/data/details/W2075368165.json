The determination of the hour of suicide was precise in 99 cases, presumptive (within a range of 1 hour) in 53, while for another 44 cases it was possible to define a probable time of suicide, grouping into four 6-hour periods (night, morning, afternoon, and evening). The remaining 27 cases were excluded as it was impossible to determine the time reliably. The data were analysed both by means of χ 2 test for goodness-of-fit and by single cosinor. A specific pattern, characterized by a significant peak in the late morning – early afternoon hours was found for the entire sample and sex subgroups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":35},"references":16,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
