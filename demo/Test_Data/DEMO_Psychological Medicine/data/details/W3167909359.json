Negative symptoms are prominent among individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis (i.e. those with prodromal syndromes) and predictive of conversion to illness. Mechanisms underlying negative symptoms are unclear in the CHR population. Methods The current study evaluated whether CHR participants demonstrated deficits in the willingness to expend effort for rewards and whether these impairments are associated with negative symptoms and greater risk for conversion. Participants included 44 CHR participants and 32 healthy controls (CN) who completed the Effort Expenditure for Reward Task (EEfRT). Results Compared to CN, CHR participants displayed reduced likelihood of exerting high effort for high probability and magnitude rewards. Among CHR participants, reduced effort expenditure was associated with greater negative symptom severity and greater probability of conversion to a psychotic disorder on a cross-sectional risk calculator. Conclusions Findings suggest that effort-cost computation is a marker of illness liability and a transphasic mechanism underlying negative symptoms in the SZ spectrum.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":19},"references":83,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
