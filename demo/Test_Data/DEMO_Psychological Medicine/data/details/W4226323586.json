Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an opportunity to examine APP using real-world data. In this study, we use EHR data to identify periods when patients were prescribed 2 + antipsychotics and compare these with periods of antipsychotic monotherapy. To determine the relationship between APP and subsequent instances of ADRs: QT interval prolongation, hyperprolactinaemia, and increased body weight [body mass index (BMI) ⩾ 25]. Methods We extracted anonymised EHR data. Patients aged 16 + receiving antipsychotic medication at Camden &amp; Islington NHS Foundation Trust between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2018 were included. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to elucidate the relationship between APP and the subsequent presence of QT interval prolongation, hyperprolactinaemia, and/or increased BMI following a period of APP within 7, 30, or 180 days respectively. Results We identified 35 409 observations of antipsychotic prescribing among 13 391 patients. Compared with antipsychotic monotherapy, APP was associated with a subsequent increased risk of hyperprolactinaemia (adjusted odds ratio 2.46; 95% CI 1.87–3.24) and of registering a BMI &gt; 25 (adjusted odds ratio 1.75; 95% CI 1.33–2.31) in the period following the APP prescribing. Conclusions Our observations suggest that APP should be carefully managed with attention to hyperprolactinaemia and obesity.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":27,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
