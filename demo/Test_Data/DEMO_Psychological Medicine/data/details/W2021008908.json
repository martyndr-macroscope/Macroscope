Decision making in deliberate self-harm (DSH), a reward-driven, high-risk behaviour, has received little attention. This study assessed decision making and problem solving in adolescents with current or past SH. Method Decision making and problem solving were assessed using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Means–Ends Problem-Solving Procedure (MEPS) respectively in 133 adolescents (57 healthy and 22 depressed controls with no SH history and 54 with SH history). A second analysis separated the SH group into current ( n =30) and past ( n =24) SH. Results The collective performance of adolescents with SH history did not differ from depressed or healthy adolescents on the IGT. However, current self-harming adolescents had a trend towards more high-risk choices ( p =0.06) than those with previous SH history and were the only group not to significantly improve over time, persisting with high-risk strategy throughout. Those who no longer self-harmed learnt to use a low-risk strategy similar to healthy and depressed controls. Recency of last SH episode correlated with IGT performance. Depressed participants performed well on the IGT but poorly on the MEPS. By contrast, both collective and divided SH groups had comparable MEPS scores to healthy controls, all performing better than depressed participants. Conclusion Poor decision making is present in adolescents who currently self-harm but not in those with previous history; improvement in decision-making skills may therefore be linked to cessation of self-harm. Depressed adolescents who do and do not self-harm may have distinct characteristics.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":127},"references":45,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
