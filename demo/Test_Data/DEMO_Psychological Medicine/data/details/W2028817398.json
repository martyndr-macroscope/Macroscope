The consequences for the provision of acute psychiatric beds for elderly patients has been investigated by comparing the usage of beds by younger and older patients with depression over a 4-year period. Overall, elderly depressed patients consumed one and a half times as many bed days as younger depressed patients and a quarter of all acute bed days available in the hospital were used by elderly depressed patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":8},"references":8,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
