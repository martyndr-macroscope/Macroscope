Scales to measure the severity of different dimensions of auditory hallucinations and delusions are few. Biochemical and psychological treatments target dimensions of symptoms and valid and reliable measures are necessary to measure these. Method. The inter-rater reliability and validity of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS: auditory hallucination subscale and delusions subscale), which measure several dimensions of auditory hallucinations and delusions were examined in this study. Results. The two scales were found to have excellent inter-rater reliability. Their validity as compared with the KGV scale (Krawiecka et al . 1977) was explored. Conclusions. It is concluded that the PSYRATS are useful assessment instruments and can complement existing measures.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":40,"cited_by_count":1405},"references":14,"networkCitations":40,"seed":false}
