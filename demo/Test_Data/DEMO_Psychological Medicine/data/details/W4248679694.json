The findings of Pilling and colleagues are clear-cut. There is good evidence of worthwhile benefit from two forms of treatment. Family therapy delivered to people with schizophrenia who are in contact with carers, and particularly in single family rather than group approaches, lowers relapse rates and improves medication compliance. Cognitive therapy improves mental states and may be particularly useful for those with resistant symptoms. By contrast two other psychological treatments, social skills training and cognitive remediation, have failed to show evidence of benefit in controlled trials. The findings of these review articles have important implications for treatment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
