Studies suggest that religiosity has greater buffering effects on mental health problems among US Blacks and Hispanics than Whites. However, whether race/ethnic differences exist in the associations of religiosity, alcohol consumption and AUD is unclear. Method Using 2004–2005 NESARC data (analytic n = 21 965), we examined the relationship of public religiosity (i.e. frequency of service attendance, religious social group size), and intrinsic religiosity (i.e. importance of religious/spiritual beliefs) to frequency of alcohol use and DSM-IV AUD in non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks, Hispanics and NH Whites, and whether associations differed by self-identified race/ethnicity. Results Only public religiosity was related to AUD. Frequency of religious service attendance was inversely associated with AUD (NH Whites β : −0.103, p &lt; 0.001; NH Blacks β : −0.115, p &lt; 0.001; Hispanics β : −0.096, p &lt; 0.001). This association was more robust for NH Blacks as compared with NH Whites and Hispanics (interaction β : 0.025, p &lt; 0.001). Among NH Whites, higher intrinsic religiosity was inversely associated with alcohol use frequency ( β : −0.143, p &lt; 0.001). These effects were more robust among NH Whites (interaction ( β : 0.072, p &lt; 0.033) than for NH Blacks ( β : −0.080, p &gt; 0.05) or Hispanics ( β : −0.002, p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions US adults reporting greater public religiosity were at lower risk for AUD. Public religiosity may be particularly important among NH Blacks, while intrinsic religiosity may be particularly important among NH Whites, and among Hispanics who frequently attend religious services. Findings may be explained by variation in drinking-related norms observed among these groups generally, and in the context of specific religious institutions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":124},"references":88,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
