There was no significant effect upon semantic retrieval or simple reaction time. It was concluded that vasopressin benefited the initial processes of consolidation and learning, while the reduction of the amnesic effects of alcohol may support the contentions of other authors that the peptide improves memory in states of mild amnesia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":25},"references":39,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
