Persistent hypersecretion of cortisol in individuals vulnerable to depression also has implications for the medical co-morbidities associated with mood disorder. Pharmacological treatments targeted at the HPA axis represent a novel approach to the management of depression and its complications; however, a better understanding of the molecular basis of HPA axis dysfunction in depressed patients will be needed before this promise can be fulfilled.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":190},"references":22,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
