From direct interviews prior to ( T1 ), and then in the same individuals after the pandemic onset ( T2 ), we assessed the influence of personal psychiatric history on changes in symptoms and wellbeing. Methods Two hundred and four (19–69 years/117 female) individuals from a multigenerational family study were followed clinically up to T1 . Psychiatric symptom changes ( T1 -to- T2 ), their association with lifetime psychiatric history (no, only-past, and recent psychiatric history), and pandemic-specific worries were investigated. Results At T2 relative to T1 , participants with recent psychopathology (in the last 2 years) had significantly fewer depressive (mean, M = 41.7 v. 47.6) and traumatic symptoms ( M = 6.6 v. 8.1, p &lt; 0.001), while those with no and only-past psychiatric history had decreased wellbeing ( M = 22.6 v. 25.0, p &lt; 0.01). Three pandemic-related worry factors were identified: Illness/death, Financial, and Social isolation. Individuals with recent psychiatric history had greater Illness/death and Financial worries than the no/only-past groups, but these worries were unrelated to depression at T2 . Among individuals with no/only-past history, Illness/death worries predicted increased T2 depression [ B = 0.6(0.3), p &lt; 0.05]. Conclusions As recent psychiatric history was not associated with increased depression or anxiety during the pandemic, new groups of previously unaffected persons might contribute to the increased pandemic-related depression and anxiety rates reported. These individuals likely represent incident cases that are first detected in primary care and other non-specialty clinical settings. Such settings may be useful for monitoring future illness among newly at-risk individuals.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":47,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
