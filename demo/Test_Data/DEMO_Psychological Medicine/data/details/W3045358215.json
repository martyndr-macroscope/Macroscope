However, AVHs also occur in populations with no need for care or distress. Aims This study investigated whether adversity exposure would differentiate clinical and healthy voice-hearers within the context of a ‘three-hit’ model of vulnerability and stress exposure. Methods Samples of 57 clinical and 45 healthy voice-hearers were compared on the three ‘hits’: familial risk; adversity exposure in childhood and in adolescence/adulthood. Results Clinical voice-hearers showed greater familial risk than healthy voice-hearers, with more family members with a history of psychosis, but not with other mental disorders. The two groups did not differ in their exposure to adversity in childhood [sexual and non-sexual, victimisation; discrimination and socio-economic status (SES)]. Contrary to expectations, clinical voice-hearers did not differ from healthy voice-hearers in their exposure to victimisation (sexual/non-sexual) and discrimination in adolescence/adulthood, but reported more cannabis and substance misuse, and lower SES. Conclusions The current study found no evidence that clinical and healthy voice-hearers differ in lifetime victimisation exposure, suggesting victimisation may be linked to the emergence of AVHs generally, rather than need-for-care. Familial risk, substance misuse and lower SES may be additional risk factors involved in the emergence of need-for-care and distress.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":6},"references":37,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
