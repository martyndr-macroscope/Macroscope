We evaluated 124 psychiatric or neurological case reports from the journal according to modern diagnostic criteria and present a brief outline of the contributors' and patients' sociodemographic characteristics, selected case reports and the surmised risk factors. A reliable diagnostic reassignment of the well-described cases was feasible; this may indicate that patients retain similar psychiatric disturbances over the centuries. As in the popular literature of the period, examples of ‘sentimental students’ and ‘desperate soldiers’ represented the most frequently discussed, prototypical high-risk personalities in the Journal , which marked the step from literature to empirical science. The influences of this case material upon contemporary psychiatric writing and thought are reviewed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":20},"references":19,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
