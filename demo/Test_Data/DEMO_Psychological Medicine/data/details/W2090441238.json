The study of cognition as an independent construct began in earnest when the detection of brain morphological abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) in patients with schizophrenia (Johnstone et al . 1976; Weinberger et al . 1979) prompted the search for behavioural correlates. It became apparent that impairments typical of damage to frontal or medial temporal lobes could be seen in patients with schizophrenia, irrespective of symptom type or severity (Goldberg et al . 1988; McKenna et al . 1990). Since then a number of findings have been replicated sufficiently to make certain conclusions about the nature and extent of cognitive dysfunction in this disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":22},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
