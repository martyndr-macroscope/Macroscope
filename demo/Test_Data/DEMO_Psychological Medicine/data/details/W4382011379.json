By the end of 2021, more than 260 million people worldwide had been infected and 5.2 million people had died because of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Various countermeasures have been implemented to contain the infections, depending on the country, infection prevalence, and political and infrastructural resources. The pandemic and the containment measures have induced diverse psychological burdens. Using internet queries as a proxy, this study examines the psychological consequences on a European level of SARS-CoV-2 containment measures. Methods Using informetric analyses, this study reviews within 32 European countries a total of 28 search parameters derived from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as aspects of affective disorder. Results Our results show that there are several psychological aspects which are significantly emphasized during the pandemic and its containment measures: ‘anxiety’, ‘dejection’, ‘weariness’, ‘listlessness’, ‘loss of appetite’, ‘loss of libido’, ‘panic attack’, and ‘worthlessness’. These terms are significantly more frequently part of a search query during the pandemic than before the outbreak. Furthermore, our results revealed that search parameters such as ‘psychologist’, ‘psychotherapist’, ‘psychotherapy’ have increased highly significantly ( p &lt; 0.01) since the pandemic. Conclusions The psychological distress caused by the pandemic correlates significantly with the frequency of people searching for psychological and psychotherapeutic support on the Internet.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":47,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
