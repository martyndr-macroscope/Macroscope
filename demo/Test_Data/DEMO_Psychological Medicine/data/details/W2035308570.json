Correlation of plasma nortriptyline levels and changes in the severity of depression, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale, showed no significant relationships. The implications of the study are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":19},"references":14,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
