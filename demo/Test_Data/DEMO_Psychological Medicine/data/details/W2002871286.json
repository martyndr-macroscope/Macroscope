The role of vulnerability factors to increase the likelihood of severs events occurring in the first place has remained largelu unexplored. The vulnerability factor which has received the most attention is a lack of social support, particularly lack of a confiding relationship with a husband for women. A reanalysis of a number of published studies is undertaken; this shows that there is a positive relationship between lack of intimacy and the occurrence of adversity. The implications of this finding are briefly discussed, with emphasis on the need for a life-span developmental perspective in future life events research.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":24},"references":20,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
