This study examined a range of socio-environmental risk factors associated with clusters of FEP, aiming a) to compare clusters of FEP and community controls using the Maudsley Environmental Risk Score for psychosis (ERS), a weighted sum of the following risks: paternal age, childhood adversities, cannabis use, and ethnic minority membership; b) to explore the putative differences in specific environmental risk factors in distinguishing within patient clusters and from controls. Methods A univariable general linear model (GLS) compared the ERS between 1,263 community controls and clusters derived from 802 FEP patients, namely, low (n = 223) and high-cognitive-functioning (n = 205), intermediate (n = 224) and deteriorating (n = 150), from the EU-GEI study. A multivariable GLS compared clusters and controls by different exposures included in the ERS. Results The ERS was higher in all clusters compared to controls, mostly in the deteriorating ( β =2.8, 95% CI 2.3 3.4 , η 2 = 0.049) and the low-cognitive-functioning cluster ( β =2.4, 95% CI 1.9 2.8, η 2 = 0.049) and distinguished them from the cluster with high-cognitive-functioning. The deteriorating cluster had higher cannabis exposure (mean difference = 0.48, 95% CI 0.49 0.91) than the intermediate having identical IQ, and more people from an ethnic minority (mean difference = 0.77, 95% CI 0.24 1.29) compared to the high-cognitive-functioning cluster. Conclusions High exposure to environmental risk factors might result in cognitive impairment and lower-than-expected functioning in individuals at the onset of psychosis. Some patients’ trajectories involved risk factors that could be modified by tailored interventions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":1},"references":80,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
