After an initial prototype-based proposal failed to gain acceptance, the Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group (P&amp;PDWG) developed a hybrid model containing categorical and dimensional components. A clash of perspectives both within the P&amp;PDWG and between the P&amp;PDWG and DSM-5 oversight committees led to the rejection of this proposal from the main body of DSM-5. Major issues included conflicting ways of conceptualizing validation, differences of opinion from personality disorder experts outside the P&amp;PDWG, divergent concepts of the magnitude of evidence needed to support substantial changes, and the disagreements about clinical utility of the hybrid model. Despite these setbacks, the ‘Alternative DSM-5 Model of Personality Disorder’ is presented in Section III of the DSM-5. Further research should clarify its performance relative to the DSM-IV criteria reprinted in the main DSM-5 text.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":202},"references":56,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
