The results suggest that even positive, supportive family relationships can have a distinctly detrimental effect, and that a depressed in-patient's return to his or her family represents a crucial period for the further course of the disorder. The findings are discussed with respect to the social support literature and the ‘Expressed Emotion’ concept. It is held that neither paradigm provides an adequate explanation, and alternative mediating mechanisms are suggested.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":10},"references":32,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
