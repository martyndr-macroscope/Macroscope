Evidence from short-term follow-up (6-week post-treatment) studies suggests that these deficits may improve or be reversed with treatment, although longer-term outcomes are unknown. Here we examined the one-year trajectory of functional activation in brain circuitry associated with reward anticipation in people with recent onset SZ who participated in coordinated specialty care (CSC) treatment, hypothesizing normalization of brain response mirroring previous short-term findings in first-episode individuals. Method Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and ventral striatum (VS) associated with reward anticipation during the Incentivized Control Engagement Task (ICE-T) was analyzed in a baseline sample of 49 healthy controls (HCs) and 52 demographically matched people with SZ, with follow-up data available for 35 HCs and 17 people with SZ. Results In agreement with our hypothesis, significant time × diagnosis interactions were observed across all regions, in which reward anticipation-associated BOLD response increased in SZ to above baseline HC levels at follow-up. Increased VS activation was associated with decreased reality distortion symptoms over the follow-up period. Baseline reward anticipation-associated BOLD response in the right anterior insula was associated with improvement in reality distortion symptoms. Conclusions These findings suggest that functional deficits in reward anticipation may be reversed after one year of CSC in recent onset participants with SZ, and that this improvement is associated with reduced positive symptoms in the illness.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":32,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
