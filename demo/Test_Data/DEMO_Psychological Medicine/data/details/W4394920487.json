However, variations in human brain glucose metabolism in concordance with seasonal changes remain under explored. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we examined seasonal effects on brain glucose metabolism, which we measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in 97 healthy participants. To maximize the sensitivity of regional effects, we computed relative metabolic measures by normalizing the regional measures to white matter metabolism. Additionally, we explored the role of rest–activity rhythms/sleep–wake activity measured with actigraphy in the seasonal variations of regional brain metabolic activity. Results We found that seasonal variations of cerebral glucose metabolism differed across brain regions. Glucose metabolism in prefrontal regions increased with longer daylength and with greater day-to-day increases in daylength. The cuneus and olfactory bulb had the maximum and minimum metabolic values around the summer and winter solstice respectively (positively associated with daylength), whereas the temporal lobe, brainstem, and postcentral cortex showed maximum and minimum metabolic values around the spring and autumn equinoxes, respectively (positively associated with faster daylength gain). Longer daylength was associated with greater amplitude and robustness of diurnal activity rhythms suggesting circadian involvement. Conclusions The current findings advance our knowledge of seasonal patterns in a key indicator of brain function relevant for mood and cognition. These data could inform treatment interventions for psychiatric symptoms that peak at specific times of the year.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":60,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
