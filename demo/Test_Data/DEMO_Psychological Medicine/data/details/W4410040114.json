Yet our understanding of how CM influences the dynamic symptom change throughout a patient’s trajectory remains limited. Hence, we investigated the impact of CM on depression severity in MDD with a focus on various treatment phases during inpatient treatment and after discharge (1 or 2 years later) and validated findings in a real-world setting. Methods We used longitudinal data from a cohort study sample ( n = 567) and a clinical routine sample ( n = 438). CM was measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and depression severity was assessed using Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI). The long-term clinical trajectory was assessed using the Life Chart Interview. Results Our analyses revealed that CM significantly increased depression severity before, during, and after inpatient therapy in both samples. Although CM was associated with higher depression severity at the beginning of inpatient treatment and lower remission rates upon discharge, no discernible impact of CM was evident on the relative change in symptoms over time during inpatient treatment. CM consistently predicted higher relapse rates and lower rates of full remission after discharge during long-term follow-up in both samples. Conclusions Our findings affirm the link between CM and the development of more severe and persistent clinical trajectories within real-world clinical settings. Furthermore, conventional psychiatric treatments may not lead to comparable outcomes for individuals with a history of CM, underscoring the necessity for tailored therapeutic interventions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":57,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
