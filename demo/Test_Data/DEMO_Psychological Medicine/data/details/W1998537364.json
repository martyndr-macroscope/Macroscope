However, no study has examined the impact of staff–patient agreement on treatment outcomes in specialist mental health services. We investigated whether a better staff–patient agreement on needs for care predicts more favourable outcome in patients receiving community-based psychiatric care. Method A 3-month prevalence cohort of 188 patients with the full spectrum of psychiatric conditions was assessed at baseline and at 4 years using the Camberwell Assessment of Need (CAN), both staff (CAN-S) and patient versions (CAN-P), and a set of standardized outcome measures. Baseline staff–patient agreement on needs was included among predictors of outcome. Both clinician-rated (psychopathology, social disability, global functioning) and patient-rated (subjective quality of life and satisfaction with services) outcomes were considered. Results Controlling for the effect of sociodemographics, service utilization and changes in clinical status, better staff–patient agreement makes a significant additional contribution in predicting treatment outcomes not only on patient-rated but also on clinician-rated measures. Conclusions Mental health care should be provided on the basis of a negotiation process involving both professionals and service users to ensure effective interventions; every effort should be made by services to implement strategies aiming to increase consensus between staff and patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":52},"references":39,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
