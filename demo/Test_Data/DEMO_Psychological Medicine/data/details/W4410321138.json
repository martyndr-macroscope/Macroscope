Methods We analyzed SCZ, BP, and MDD genome-wide association datasets available from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium using the PLEIO framework and characterized the pleiotropic loci identified using pathway and tissue enrichment analyses. Pleiotropic and disorder-specific loci were also assessed. Results Our pleiotropy-informed genome-wide analysis identified 553 variants that included 192 loci not reaching genome-wide significance in input datasets. These were enriched for five molecular pathways: cadherin signaling ( p = 2.18 × 10 −8 ), Alzheimer’s disease-amyloid secretase ( p = 4 × 10 −4 ), oxytocin receptor-mediated signaling ( p = 1.47 × 10 −3 ), metabotropic glutamate receptor group III ( p = 5.82 × 10 −4 ) and Wnt signaling ( p = 1.61 × 10 −11 ). Pleiotropic loci demonstrated the strongest enrichment in the brain cortex ( p = 5.8 × 10 −28 ), frontal cortex ( p = 3 × 10 −31 ), and cerebellar hemisphere ( p = 9.8 × 10 −28 ). SCZ-BP-MDD pleiotropic variants were also enriched for neurodevelopmental brain transcriptomic profiles related to the second-trimester post-conception (week 21, p = 7.35 × 10 −5 ; week 17, p = 6.36 × 10 −4 ) and first year of life ( p = 3.25 × 10 −5 ). Conclusions Genetic mechanisms shared among SCZ, BP, and MDD appear to be related to early neuronal development. Because the genetic architecture of psychopathology transcends diagnostic boundaries, pleiotropy-focused analyses can lead to increased gene discovery and novel insights into relevant pathogenic mechanisms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":43,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
