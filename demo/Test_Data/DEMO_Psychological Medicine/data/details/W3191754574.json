The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia patients with residual negative symptoms. Methods In this 6-week, randomized, single-blind, controlled study, a total of 100 schizophrenia patients with residual negative symptoms were randomly assigned to the MBI or control group. The 6-week MBI group and the control group with general rehabilitation programs maintained their original antipsychotic treatments. The scores for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were recorded at baseline and week 6 to assess psychotic symptoms, cognitive performance, and emotional state, respectively. Results Compared with general rehabilitation programs, MBI alleviated the PANSS-negative subscore, general psychopathology subscore, and PANSS total score in schizophrenia patients with residual negative symptoms ( F = 33.77, p Bonferroni &lt; 0.001; F = 42.01, p Bonferroni &lt; 0.001; F = 52.41, p Bonferroni &lt; 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, MBI improved RBANS total score and immediate memory subscore ( F = 8.80, p Bonferroni = 0.024; F = 11.37, p Bonferroni = 0.006), as well as SCL-90 total score in schizophrenia patients with residual negative symptoms ( F = 18.39, p Bonferroni &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Our results demonstrate that MBI helps schizophrenia patients with residual negative symptoms improve clinical symptoms including negative symptom, general psychopathology symptom, and cognitive impairment.
