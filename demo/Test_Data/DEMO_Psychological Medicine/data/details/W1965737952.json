A set of 8 questions derived from the Cornell Medical Index was used as an index of emotional distress. The concentration camp survivors had a higher prevalence of emotional distress and more symptoms of this type than other European-born members of the community, controlling for age and education. The findings suggested that 16·0% of the emotional distress observed in male camp survivors and 22·9% of that among female camp survivors could be attributed to the camp experience almost three decades after the Holocaust. In this survey, data were elicited in a context unrelated to benefit-seeking such as clinic or compensation claims.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":52},"references":18,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
