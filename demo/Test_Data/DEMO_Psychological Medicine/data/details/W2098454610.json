The estimates were reliable measures, but they did not correlate with the subjects' actual body widths. The implications of this finding especially when relating anorexic patients' self-perceptions to their clinical outcome, are discussed. It seems preferable to use such estimates untransformed by division with the subjects' actual body widths.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":41},"references":19,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
