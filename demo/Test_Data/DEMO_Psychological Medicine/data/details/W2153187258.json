Method We studied clinical correlates of insight in a sample of 110 adolescent recent-onset psychosis patients (mean age 15.53 years; psychotic symptoms present for &lt;6 months). Insight was measured with the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD) at baseline, 6 months and 12 months follow-up. Results Insight improved over the early phases of the illness, in parallel with psychopathological improvement. Poor insight at baseline and 6 months correlated with poor functioning at 6 and 12 months respectively. Schizophrenia patients had poorer insight than patients with bipolar disorder at 6 and 12 months but not at baseline. Logistic and linear regressions were used to predict 12-month diagnoses and functioning based on insight measurements. Baseline awareness of illness was a significant predictor for diagnosis [odds ratio (OR) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.97]. Treatment compliance at 6 months did not correlate with baseline SUMD subscores, but correlated with insight into having a disorder (Spearman's ρ=0.21, p =0.039), its consequences (Spearman's ρ=0.28, p =0.006) and the need for treatment (Spearman's ρ=0.26, p =0.012) at 6 months. The ‘attribution of symptoms’ dimension of insight is poorly correlated with other insight dimensions and with other clinical variables. Conclusions Poor insight correlates with symptom severity and global functioning but also has some trait value for schizophrenia, which is apparent once acute psychotic symptomatology is not prominent. A multi-dimensional approach to the assessment of insight is necessary, as different dimensions are influenced by different factors.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":49},"references":54,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
