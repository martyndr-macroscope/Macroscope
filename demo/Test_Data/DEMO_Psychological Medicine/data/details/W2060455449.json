Cognitively oriented psychotherapy for early psychosis (COPE) is aimed at facilitating the adjustment of the person, and preventing or alleviating secondary morbidity in the wake of the first psychotic episode. The present study reports on the outcomes of a controlled trial comparing two conditions: COPE versus No-COPE. Method. Ninety-one people participated in the trial which was analysed by intention-to-treat, including 12 people who were assigned to COPE but refused to participate. Assessments were conducted at pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment. Hospital readmission data were obtained through a Psychiatric Case Register. The study was conducted in a front-line public mental health service, the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC). Clients in both COPE and No-COPE were provided with full access to the complete range of EPPIC services. Results. There were no significant differences between the two conditions on the nine primary outcome variables. Hospital readmissions were assessed for each client at yearly intervals up to 4 years following the completion of treatment and again there were no significant between-group differences. Conclusions. The study indicated that there was no significant advantage to COPE over and above routine care at EPPIC.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":66},"references":45,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
