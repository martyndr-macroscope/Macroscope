However, its neural mechanisms remain unclear. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) region may be associated with SI in MDD patients. This study aimed to elucidate the neural mechanisms of SI in MDD patients by analyzing changes in gray matter volume (GMV) in brain structures in the ACC region, which has not been adequately studied to date. Methods According to the REST-meta-MDD project, this study subjects consisted of 235 healthy controls and 246 MDD patients, including 123 MDD patients with and 123 without SI, and their structural magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Correlation analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to determine whether there was a correlation between GMV of ACC and SI in MDD patients. Results MDD patients with SI had higher HAMD scores and greater GMV in bilateral ACC compared to MDD patients without SI (all p &lt; 0.001). GMV of bilateral ACC was positively correlated with SI in MDD patients and entered the regression equation in the subsequent logistic regression analysis. Conclusions Our findings suggest that GMV of ACC may be associated with SI in patients with MDD and is a sensitive biomarker of SI.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":121,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
