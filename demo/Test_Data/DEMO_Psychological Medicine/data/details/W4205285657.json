Accumulating evidence suggests an important association between deployment and the development of other mental health symptoms beyond post-traumatic stress disorder. Methods This study examined the prevalence of agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, and hostility symptoms in a cohort of Dutch ISAF veterans ( N = 978) from pre-deployment up to 10 years after homecoming. The interaction of potential moderating factors with the change in mental health symptoms relative to pre-deployment was investigated at each time point. Results The probable prevalence of agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, and hostility symptoms significantly increased over time to respectively 6.5, 2.7, 3.5, and 6.2% at 10 years after deployment. Except for hostility symptoms, the probable prevalence at 10 years after deployment was the highest compared to all previous follow-up assessments. Importantly, less perceived social support after returning from deployment was found as a risk factor for all different mental health symptoms. Unit support was not associated with the development of mental health problems. Conclusions This study suggests a probable broad and long-term impact of deployment on the mental health of military service members. Due to the lack of a non-deployed control group, causal effects of deployment could not be demonstrated. Continued effort should nevertheless be made in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of mental health symptoms, even a decade after deployment. The findings also underscore the importance of social support after homecoming and its potential for the prevention of long-term mental health problems.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":12},"references":49,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
