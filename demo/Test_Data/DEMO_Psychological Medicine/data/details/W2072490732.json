Selected aspects of the acquisition, maintenance, and elimination of this type of morphine dependent behaviour were studied and the findings are discussed in terms of their relevance to man.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":80,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
