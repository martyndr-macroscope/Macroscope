The results strongly support the view that general practitioners' diagnostic habits should be validated before their records are used to provide data on ‘official’ estimates of psychiatric morbidity. It is recommended that, whatever the quality of the data, large tables of official socio-economic or medical statistics should be supplemented by graphical summaries, as they quite often are in France.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":9},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
