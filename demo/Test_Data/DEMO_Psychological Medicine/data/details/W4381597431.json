Given that cannabis use is more prevalent among people with depression, legalisation may lead to more adverse events in this population. Cannabis legalisation in Canada included the legalisation of flower and herbs (phase 1) in October 2018, and the deregulation of cannabis edibles one year later (phase 2). This study investigated disparities in cannabis-related emergency department (ED) visits in depressed and non-depressed individuals in each phase. Methods Using administrative data, we identified all adults diagnosed with depression 60 months prior to legalisation ( n = 929 844). A non-depressed comparison group was identified using propensity score matching. We compared the pre–post policy differences in cannabis-related ED-visits in depressed individuals v. matched (and unmatched) non-depressed individuals. Results In the matched sample (i.e. comparison with non-depressed people similar to the depressed group), people with depression had approximately four times higher risk of cannabis-related ED-visits relative to the non-depressed over the entire period. Phases 1 and 2 were not associated with any changes in the matched depressed and non-depressed groups. In the unmatched sample (i.e. comparison with the non-depressed general population), the disparity between individuals with and without depression is greater. While phase 1 was associated with an immediate increase in ED-visits among the general population, phase 2 was not associated with any changes in the unmatched depressed and non-depressed groups. Conclusions Depression is a risk factor for cannabis-related ED-visits. Cannabis legalisation did not further elevate the risk among individuals diagnosed with depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":23,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
