Pleasant experiences have proved to be recalled significantly more quickly than unpleasant experiences in healthy volunteer subjects, and especially in those scoring low on neuroticism or high on extraversion as measured by the Eysenck Personality Inventory. The overall pleasant/unpleasant differential was found to persist on re-testing some months later with an alternative form of the test. The technique appears to be a valid and simple means for exploring hedonic selectivity in memory.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":55},"references":5,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
