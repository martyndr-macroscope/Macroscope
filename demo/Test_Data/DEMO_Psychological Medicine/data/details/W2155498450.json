The current training package can improve skills and is well accepted. If it were to produce a modest fall in the suicide rate, such training would be cost-effective. However, a future training programme should develop a broader training package to reach those who will not attend.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":146},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
