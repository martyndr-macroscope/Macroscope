Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) can be used to quantify cumulative genetic risk for a trait at an individual level. Recent studies suggest PRSs for anorexia nervosa (AN) may also predict risk for other disordered eating behaviors, but no study has examined if PRS for AN can predict disordered eating as a global continuous measure. This study aimed to investigate whether PRS for AN predicted overall levels of disordered eating, or specific lifetime disordered eating behaviors, in an Australian adolescent female population. Methods PRSs were calculated based on summary statistics from the largest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN genome-wide association study to date. Analyses were performed using genome-wide complex trait analysis to test the associations between AN PRS and disordered eating global scores, avoidance of eating, objective bulimic episodes, self-induced vomiting, and driven exercise in a sample of Australian adolescent female twins recruited from the Australian Twin Registry ( N = 383). Results After applying the false-discovery rate correction, the AN PRS was significantly associated with all disordered eating outcomes. Conclusions Findings suggest shared genetic etiology across disordered eating presentations and provide insight into the utility of AN PRS for predicting disordered eating behaviors in the general population. In the future, PRSs for EDs may have clinical utility in early disordered eating risk identification, prevention, and intervention.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":2},"references":56,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
