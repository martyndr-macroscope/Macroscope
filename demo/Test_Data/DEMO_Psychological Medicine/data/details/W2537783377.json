In this open-label 1-year extension study we report the long-term effects and tolerability of memantine add-on therapy to clozapine. Method Completers of the first trial who experienced beneficial effects during 12 weeks of memantine treatment received memantine for 1 year. Primary endpoints were memory and executive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S). Results Of 31 randomized controlled trial completers who experienced beneficial effects from memantine, 24 received memantine for 1 year. The small improvement in memory found in the memantine condition in the placebo-controlled trial remained stable in the extension study. Executive function did not improve. After 26 weeks of memantine add-on therapy to clozapine, PANSS negative symptoms ( r = 0.53), PANSS positive symptoms ( r = 0.50) and PANSS total symptoms ( r = 0.54) significantly improved. Even further significant improvement in all these measures was observed between 26 weeks and 52 weeks of memantine, with effect sizes varying from 0.39 to 0.51. CGI-S showed a non-significant moderate improvement at 26 weeks ( r = 0.36) and 52 weeks ( r = 0.34). Memantine was well tolerated without serious adverse effects. Conclusions In the 1-year extension phase the favourable effect of adjunctive memantine on memory was sustained and we observed further improvement of negative, positive and overall symptoms in patients with clozapine-treated refractory schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":29},"references":83,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
