Here we investigated the shared familiality of IC and these other nociplastic and psychiatric conditions. Methods Subjects were identified in the Utah Population Database, which links genealogy data back to the 1800s to medical record diagnosis billing code data back to 1995. We computed the relative risk of each of these disorders among first (FDR), second (SDR), and third-degree relatives (TDR) of six proband groups: IC, FM, IBS, ME/CFS, PD, and MDD. Given the known familial aggregation of each of these disorders, we conducted our analyses to test for heritable interrelationships using proband subgroups whose members did not have the diagnosis assessed in their relatives. Results We observed strong evidence for heritable interrelationships among all six disorders. Most analyses indicated significantly increased risk for each of the six disorders in FDR, SDR, and TDR of all or most proband groups. Out of 30 possible bidirectional disorder interrelationships, 26 were significant among FDR, 23 were significant among SDR, and 7 were significant among TDR. Clustering was observed in both close and distant relatives. Conclusions Our results support a common, heritable component to IC and other nociplastic and psychiatric conditions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":9},"references":54,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
