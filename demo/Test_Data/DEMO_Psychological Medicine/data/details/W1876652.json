Hypotheses were tested on samples of 'somatizers', 'psychologizers' and controls recruited by epidemiological procedures. Although 'somatizers' were found to be similar to 'psychologizers' in many respects, they were (i) less depressed; (ii) reported lower levels of social dissatisfaction, social stress and less dependence on their relatives; (iii) more likely to have an unsympathetic attitude towards mental illness and less likely to consult a doctor about psychological symptoms, and (iv) more likely to have received medical in-patient care as an adult before they had consulted their doctor with their current illness. These findings are discussed in the context of previous research.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":140},"references":0,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
