Though the savant poet performed less efficiently on formal language tests supposed to tap creativity, there were few differences between the two poets in regard to the poems' content and the use of various structural devices. The poems by the savant referred more often to aspects of self-analysis, while descriptions of people not related to the self were less frequent. Both poets made use of similes and metaphors. The results are discussed in terms of different modular domains within the language system.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":23},"references":58,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
