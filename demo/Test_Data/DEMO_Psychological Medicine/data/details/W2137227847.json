A few patients had significantly lower H-reflex recovery curves. Chronic neuroleptic treatment produced relatively lower recovery curves, whereas fluoxetine, a specific serotonin uptake blocker, produced relatively higher curves.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":22},"references":44,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
