The two groups were comparable except that the bipolar group tended to have more frequent episodes of illness and to have more family histories of affective disorder. There was no significant difference between the CBC values in each group.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":4,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
