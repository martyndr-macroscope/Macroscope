However, a major challenge in this field is elucidating the ontological basis of these changes. Here, we aimed to explore the relationship between brain structural changes in MDD-related brain aging and neurotransmitter expression levels and transcriptomics. Methods Imaging data from 670 Japanese participants (MDD: health controls = 233:437) and the support vector regression model were utilized to predict and compare brain age between MDD patients and healthy controls. A map of differences in cortical thickness was generated, furthermore, spatial correlation analysis with neurotransmitters and correlation analysis with gene expression were performed. Results The degree of brain aging was found to be significantly higher in patients with MDD. Moreover, significant cortical thinning was observed in the left ventral area, and premotor eye field in patients with MDD. A significant correlation was observed between MDD-related cortical thinning and neurotransmitter receptors/transporters, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems. Enriched Gene Ontology terms, including protein binding, plasma membrane, and protein processing, contribute to MDD-related cortical thinning. Conclusions The findings of this study provide further evidence that patients with MDD experience more severe brain aging, deepening our understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms and genetic basis of the brain changes involved. Additionally, these findings hold promise for the development of interventions aimed at preventing further deterioration in MDD-related brain aging, thus offering potential therapeutic avenues.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":54,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
