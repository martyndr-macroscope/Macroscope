Studies of family relationships in anorexia nervosa have produced conflicting results. Some authors claim that family factors are related to short-term outcomes. Methods. Perceived rearing practices, as measured by the EMBU ( Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran : ‘My memories of Upbringing’) were examined in a sample ( N = 158) of adolescents with anorexia nervosa and compared with the perceptions of adolescents ( N = 159) from the general population. A further comparison was made between the groups of patients with good and bad short-term outcomes. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of different variables on short-term outcome. Results. Overall, small differences were observed in the perceptions of rearing practices as expressed by the controls and the anorexic patients. Patients with bad short-term outcome perceived more rejection and control–overprotection from both parents than those with good outcome. In the logistic regression analysis only Rejection from father and the EAT (Eating Attitudes Test) total score gave independent prediction of treatment response. Conclusions. Taken as a whole, these results do not support the idea of altered rearing practices in anorexic patients, at least in young patients with a short evolution of the disease. Perceived rearing practices, especially ‘rejection’, appear to have an appreciable effect on the short-term outcome.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":31},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
