Furthermore, the recognition of some major risk factors of cerebrovascular disease makes VaD a form of ‘preventable senility’ (Hachinski, 1992). The last decade has seen a major re-evaluation of the concept of VaD (Erkinjuntti &amp; Hachinski, 1993; Hachinski, 1994), with new diagnostic criteria having been proposed (World Health Organization, 1993; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) but without any consensus (Wetterling et al . 1996). Indeed, some investigators have called for the abandonment of the diagnosis of VaD and the adoption of alternative nosology (Hachinski, 1994). It is therefore time to re-examine the concept of VaD and evaluate its distinctive features.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":32},"references":35,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
