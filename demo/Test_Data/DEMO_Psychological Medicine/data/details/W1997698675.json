It was administered to the mothers of 116 randomly selected junior and secondary school children in the general population, stratified into age, sex, social class, and school groupings. Two meaningful dimensions were revealed by principal component factor analyses: one concerned with reliance on mother and the other reflecting sociability. Reliability and validity were found to be satisfactory.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":6},"references":16,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
