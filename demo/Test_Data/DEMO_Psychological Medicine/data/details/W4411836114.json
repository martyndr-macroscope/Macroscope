The aim was an intervention that patients can easily access and use, produces large clinical effects, and can be supported by a range of mental health professionals in less contact time than face-to-face therapy. We report here the proof-of-concept testing. At least moderate-sized clinical effects were required to progress to a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods In the 6-month Feeling Safer online program, a certified medical device, patients complete a brief assessment and then are provided with up to 10 modules that match their difficulties. Regular remote meetings with a mental health professional also take place. These may be supplemented by in-person visits. A pre- to post-treatment cohort trial was conducted with 14 patients with persistent persecutory delusions. The primary outcome was the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS)-Delusions. Results Satisfaction and usability ratings of the program were high. Very large reductions in persecutory delusions were observed (PSYRATS mean reduction = 7.1, 95% C.I. = 3.4, 10.8, n = 13, Cohen’s d = 3.0). There were large improvements in paranoia, anxiety, depression, agoraphobic distress, psychological wellbeing, meaningful activity, personal recovery, recovering quality of life, and moderate improvements in insomnia, agoraphobic avoidance, and quality of life. Conclusions The clinical effects associated with Feeling Safer were very high, comparable to those seen in the evaluations of the face-to-face therapy, and enable progression to an RCT.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":1},"references":37,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
