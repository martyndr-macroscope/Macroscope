Men with unipolar depressive illnesses had significantly lower CBC values than men with bipolar illnesses and male controls. No other significant differences in CBC values were found and it was concluded that elevated total plasma cortisol levels in affective disorder were probably associated with increased levels of unbound cortisol. The possibility that low CBC values may be a genetic marker for certain types of affective disorder requires further investigation. The effect of certain drugs on CBC was also investigated.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":12},"references":44,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
