Thus, understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of the course of MDD is of utmost importance. A detrimental course of illness in MDD was most consistently associated with superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) fiber integrity. As similar associations were, however, found between SLF fiber integrity and acute symptomatology, this study attempts to disentangle associations attributed to current depression from long-term course of illness. Methods A total of 531 patients suffering from acute ( N = 250) or remitted ( N = 281) MDD from the FOR2107-cohort were analyzed in this cross-sectional study using tract-based spatial statistics for diffusion tensor imaging. First, the effects of disease state (acute v . remitted), current symptom severity (BDI-score) and course of illness (number of hospitalizations) on fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity were analyzed separately. Second, disease state and BDI-scores were analyzed in conjunction with the number of hospitalizations to disentangle their effects. Results Disease state ( p FWE &lt; 0.042) and number of hospitalizations ( p FWE &lt; 0.032) were associated with decreased FA and increased MD and RD in the bilateral SLF. A trend was found for the BDI-score ( p FWE &gt; 0.067). When analyzed simultaneously only the effect of course of illness remained significant ( p FWE &lt; 0.040) mapping to the right SLF. Conclusions Decreased FA and increased MD and RD values in the SLF are associated with more hospitalizations when controlling for current psychopathology. SLF fiber integrity could reflect cumulative illness burden at a neurobiological level and should be targeted in future longitudinal analyses.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":10},"references":87,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
