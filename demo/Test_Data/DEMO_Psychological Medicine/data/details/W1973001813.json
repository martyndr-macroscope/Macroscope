Neither drug-free depressed patients nor lithium-treated euthymic patients show a differential deficit in verbal versus non-verbal recall. However, while euthymic patients show no memory impairment, drug-free depressives do show poor memory functioning. The results support the view that memory deficits observed in affective patients in the depressed state are transient, secondary manifestations of depression and are neither indicative of underlying organic pathology, nor of abnormal hemispheric laterality. This suggests that memory impairment in depression can be treated by treating depressive symptoms, both chemically and behaviourally. The results also support the view that prophylactic lithium treatment has no adverse effects on these memory tasks.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":55},"references":42,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
