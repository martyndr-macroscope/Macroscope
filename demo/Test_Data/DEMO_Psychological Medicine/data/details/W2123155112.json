This study examines the extent to which independent observers can recognize statements made about family interactions. These statements were of a type which clinicians dealing with families would make and comprised observations with varying levels of inference. A special method was devised to test a number of specific hypotheses concerning the processes of clinical observation. The results show that such descriptions are recognizable as being made about a particular family even when this involves discriminating between clinically similar families. Some of the implications of these results for observational research are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":22},"references":16,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
