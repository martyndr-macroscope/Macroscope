Furthermore, studies rarely explore sex differences in this area despite males and females often differing in the experiences of ACEs, depressive symptoms, and inflammatory activity. To address these issues, we used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to model the effects of 10 different ACEs on C-reactive protein (CRP) and depressive symptoms in adulthood. Path modeling was used to measure the effects of ACEs on CRP and depressive symptoms conjointly while also assigning covariances among ACEs to assess their interrelations. Sex-by-ACE interaction terms and sex-disaggregated models were used to test for potential differences. Emotional abuse and parental incarceration were consistently related to both CRP and depressive symptoms for males and females. Childhood maltreatment was associated with depressive symptoms for females, whereas sexual abuse was associated with inflammation for males. Several covariances among ACEs were identified, indicating potential networks through which ACEs are indirectly associated with CRP and depressive symptoms. These data demonstrate that ACEs have differing direct effects on CRP and depressive symptoms – and that they differ with respect to how they cluster – for males versus females. These differences should be considered in theory and clinical workflows aiming to understand, treat, and prevent the long-term impacts of ACEs on depressive symptoms and inflammation-related health conditions in adulthood.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":89,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
