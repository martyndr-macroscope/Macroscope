She had a raised plasma cortisol and was made worse by progesterone or by ACTH. An oestradiol/testosterone implant every 4 months abolished all symptoms for at least 8 years, and plasma cortisol returned to normal. This case is relevant to an understanding of premenstrual syndromes and the genesis of depressive illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":23},"references":14,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
