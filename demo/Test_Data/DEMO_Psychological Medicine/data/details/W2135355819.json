This prediction has been confirmed when the responses of a group of patients with endogenous depression were compared with the responses of a group of patients with other functional psychoses, a group of patients with reactive depression, and a group of patients with other psychiatric diagnoses. These findings support the hypothesis that there is a functional deficiency of noradrenaline at some central α-adrenergic receptors.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":86},"references":52,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
