Their performance was compared with that of 15 elderly control subjects. The demented patients' spontaneous drawings were found to be impoverished in comparison with those of the controls. Copies of the same objects included more details, but these tended to be wrongly positioned in space. The performance of the patients with dementia was unlike that reported for patients with focal brain lesions. Significant relations were found between drawing performance and intellectual functioning and severity of dementia. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":101},"references":41,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
