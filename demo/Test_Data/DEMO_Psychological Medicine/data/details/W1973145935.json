The model used is a stepwise linear regression using 5 variables including toxic gas production. The variables give a good description of the observed changes in suicide mortality. The limitations of the method and the data are discussed. Despite the limitations of the method, it can be concluded that toxic gas production affected total suicide mortality.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":24},"references":18,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
