Here, we evaluate (1) the extent of variation in SR in patients using a single antipsychotic; (2) the association between subjective and symptomatic response; and (3) predictors of SR. Methods Open-label, single treatment condition with amisulpride in 339 patients with a first episode of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, at most minimally treated before inclusion. Patients were evaluated at baseline, before start with amisulpride and after four weeks of treatment with the Subjective Wellbeing under Neuroleptic scale, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia. Results (1) 26.8% of the patients had a substantial favorable SR, and 12.4% of the patients experienced a substantial dysphoric SR during treatment with amisulpride. (2) Modest positive associations were found between SR and 4 weeks change on symptom subscales ( r = 0.268–0.390, p values &lt; 0.001). (3) Baseline affective symptoms contributed to the prediction of subjective remission, demographic characteristics did not. Lower start dosage of amisulpride was associated with a more favorable SR ( r = −0.215, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions We conclude that variation in individual proneness for an unfavorable SR is substantial and only modestly associated with symptomatic response. We need earlier identification of those most at risk for unfavorable SR and research into interventions to improve SR to antipsychotic medication in those at risk.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
