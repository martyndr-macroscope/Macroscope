High, intermediate and low noise sensitive women were compared, using measures of blood pressure, heart rate, skin conductance, hearing threshold, uncomfortable loudness level and magnitude estimation of six tones. These physiological measures did not clearly distinguish different noise sensitivity groups, except that highly noise sensitive women had a consistently slower heart rate. Noise sensitivity was not related to auditory threshold. In the high aircraft noise area there were significantly more skin conductance responses than in the low aircraft noise area, irrespective of noise sensitivity. This may be the result of chronic exposure to high aircraft noise.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":41},"references":25,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
