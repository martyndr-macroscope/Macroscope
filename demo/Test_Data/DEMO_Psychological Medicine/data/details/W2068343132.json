The purpose of this study was to assess clinical characteristics, including co-morbid personality disorders in patients with both anorexia nervosa (AN) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in comparison with age- and sex-matched patients with OCD. Methods. Fifty-three female patients with AN were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of a current diagnosis of OCD, as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Patient version (SCID-P). Twenty-one women (40%) who met the DSM-III-R criteria for both AN and OCD were compared with 23 female patients with OCD, using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the SCID Axis II disorders. Results. There were no significant differences on the mean Y-BOCS severity scores between these groups. However, AN patients with OCD were significantly more likely than OCD patients to have obsessions with need for symmetry or exactness and ordering/arranging compulsions, whereas both aggressive obsessions and checking compulsions tended to be more frequently identified in OCD patients compared with AN patients with OCD. AN patients with OCD were significantly more likely than OCD patients to meet the criteria for obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). Conclusions. These results suggest that there are some differential characteristics of the OCD symptomatology between these disorders, although many patients with AN manifest significant impairment from primary OCD symptoms with similar magnitude in severity to that found in OCD patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":66},"references":39,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
