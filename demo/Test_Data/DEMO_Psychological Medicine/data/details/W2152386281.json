Method The data used were from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Studies (CPES). Results There was an association between household income and MDD among Whites. However, the association was not statistically significant. Statistically significant associations were present between educational attainment and MDD among Whites. Among both Whites and Latinos, being out of the labor force was significantly associated with MDD. In analyses by nativity, being out of the labor force was significantly associated with MDD among US-born and foreign-born Latinos. Conclusions Significant associations between various measures of SES and MDD were consistently observed among White and, in some cases, Latino populations. Future studies should continue to examine sociopsychological factors related to SES that increase the risk of MDD among people from racial-ethnic communities.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":130},"references":58,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
