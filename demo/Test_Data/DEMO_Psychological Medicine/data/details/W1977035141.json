The Portuguese translation of the CIS was found to be a feasible instrument for community studies in Brazil, but the Portuguese translation of the GHQ-30 was shown to be of limited use in this particular setting. The extent of minor psychiatric morbidity was very high (46%); 33% was regarded as conspicuous (CPM) and 13% as hidden (HPM).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":53},"references":15,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
