A group of factory employees was contrasted with a ‘mixed occupation’ group for a comparison of type of employment. The general contention that the association between employment and well-being would vary with position in the life cycle was confirmed for distress, physical illness and some of the satisfaction measures. Only one measure (personal competence) suggested that employment had a positive influence on well-being irrespective of lifestage. Young employees working for longer hours and older housewives were both defined as ‘cases’ by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). However, their profiles on the other well-being variables were very different.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":23},"references":62,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
