Analytical flexibility may contribute to this, by increasing the likelihood that a reported finding represents a chance result. We explored whether analytical flexibility has increased over time, using human imaging studies of bipolar disorder and major depression. Our results indicate that the number of measures collected per study has increased over time for studies of bipolar disorder, but not for studies of major depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":10,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
