Evidence on the adult adaptation of individuals with mild mental retardation (MMR) is sparse, and knowledge of the factors associated with more and less successful functioning in MMR samples yet more limited. Method. Prospective data from the National Child Development Study were used to examine social circumstances and psychosocial functioning in adulthood in individuals with MMR and in a non-retarded comparison group. Results. For many individuals with MMR, living circumstances and social conditions in adulthood were poor and potential stressors high. Self-reports of psychological distress in adulthood were markedly elevated, but relative rates of psychiatric service use fell between childhood and adulthood, as reflected in attributable risks. Childhood family and social disadvantage accounted for some 20–30% of variations between MMR and non-retarded samples on a range of adult outcomes. Early social adversity also played a significant role in contributing to variations in functioning within the MMR sample. Conclusions. MMR appears to be associated with substantial continuing impairment for many individuals.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":92},"references":42,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
