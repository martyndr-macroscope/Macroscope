Psychophysiological endophenotypes to characterize mechanisms of known schizophrenia genetic loci. Psychological Medicine, 2017), focused solely on schizophrenia, to test the association between multivariate psychophysiological candidate endophenotypes (including novel measures of θ / δ oscillatory activity) and a range of polygenic scores (PGSs), namely alcohol/cannabis/nicotine use, an updated schizophrenia PGS (containing 52 more genome-wide significant loci than the PGS used in our previous report) and educational attainment. Method A large community-based twin/family sample ( N = 4893) was genome-wide genotyped and imputed. PGSs were constructed for alcohol use, regular smoking initiation, lifetime cannabis use, schizophrenia, and educational attainment. Eleven endophenotypes were assessed: visual oddball task event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) measures (target-related parietal P3 amplitude, frontal θ , and parietal δ energy/inter-trial phase clustering), band-limited resting-state EEG power, antisaccade error rate. Principal component analysis exploited covariation among endophenotypes to extract a smaller number of meaningful dimensions/components for statistical analysis. Results Endophenotypes were heritable. PGSs showed expected intercorrelations (e.g. schizophrenia PGS correlated positively with alcohol/nicotine/cannabis PGSs). Schizophrenia PGS was negatively associated with an event-related P3/ δ component [ β = −0.032, nonparametric bootstrap 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.059 to −0.003]. A prefrontal control component (event-related θ /antisaccade errors) was negatively associated with alcohol ( β = −0.034, 95% CI −0.063 to −0.006) and regular smoking PGSs ( β = −0.032, 95% CI −0.061 to −0.005) and positively associated with educational attainment PGS ( β = 0.031, 95% CI 0.003–0.058). Conclusions Evidence suggests that multivariate endophenotypes of decision-making (P3/ δ ) and cognitive/attentional control ( θ /antisaccade error) relate to alcohol/nicotine, schizophrenia, and educational attainment PGSs and represent promising targets for future research.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":6},"references":104,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
