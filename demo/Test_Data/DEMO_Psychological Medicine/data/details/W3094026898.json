Therefore, we aimed to assess in drug-free patients the olfactory performance of patients with major depressive episodes (MDE) and its change after antidepressant treatment. Methods In the DEP-ARREST-CLIN study, 69 drug-free patients with a current MDE in the context of major depressive disorder (MDD) were assessed for their olfactory performances and depression severity, before and after 1 (M1) and 3 (M3) months of venlafaxine antidepressant treatment. They were compared to 32 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Olfaction was assessed with a psychophysical test, the Sniffin’ Sticks test ( Threshold : T score; Discrimination: D score; Identification : I score; total score: T + D + I = TDI score) and Pleasantness (pleasantness score: p score; neutral score: N score; unpleasantness score: U score). Results As compared to HCs, depressed patients had lower TDI olfactory scores [mean ( s.d. ) 30.0(4.5) v. 33.3(4.2), p &lt; 0.001], T scores [5.6(2.6) v. 7.4(2.6), p &lt; 0.01], p scores [7.5(3.0) v. 9.8(2.8), p &lt; 0.001)] and higher N scores [3.5(2.6) v. 2.1(1.8), p &lt; 0.01]. T , p and N scores at baseline were independent from depression and anhedonia severity. After venlafaxine treatment, significant increases of T scores [M1: 7.0(2.6) and M3: 6.8(3.1), p &lt; 0.01] and p scores [M1: 8.1(3.0) and M3: 8.4(3.3), p &lt; 0.05] were evidenced, in remitters only ( T : p &lt; 0.01; P : p &lt; 0.01). Olfaction improvement was mediated by depression improvement. Conclusions The olfactory signature of MDE is restored after venlafaxine treatment. This olfaction improvement is mediated by depression improvement.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":17},"references":64,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
