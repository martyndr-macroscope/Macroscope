The data were collected as part of the Leicestershire ECT trial. One group comprised 96 patients who consented to enter the trial. The other group was formed by 23 patients who refused to participate in the trial, but who agreed to be interviewed so that their attitudes could be assessed. The method of applying Q-analysis is described, and the resultant outputs for the two groups are discussed. The presence of insight, a subjective need for treatment and trust in ECT were significant features in the 96 patients who agreed to enter the trial. However, among this group there was a subset of patients who were very anxious and who had little desire to receive ECT or trust in it. Among the 23 patients who refused to participate in the trial two main viewpoints could be discerned. First, there was a subgroup who seemed accurately to assess their need for treatment, had insight and trust in ECT as well as specifically wanting to receive it. The second was composed of patients who were very apprehensive, did not want ECT and generally were unhappy about being in hospital. In both groups it was considered that level of knowledge was relatively unimportant in the formation of attitudes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
