Historically the gland has been associated with speculation on the nature of mind and its disorders. Modern research is now demonstrating it to be an endocrine gland capable of affecting the brain and behaviour. The implications for future research into this aspect of pineal function are discussed in the context of a critical review of the current literature.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":32},"references":149,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
