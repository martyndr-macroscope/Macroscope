Of the 8 classes thus created, all but one showed a statistically significant annual cycle with a peak in Summer and trough in Winter. There was no significant difference in phase or amplitude between male and female cycles. A linear increase in yearly re-admission rates was found during the 8 years of the English and the 11 years of the Scottish data. Current month's mean daily temperature (lag 0 ) and last month's (lag 1 ) mean day-length and mean daily hours of sunshine correlated better with admission rate than did the values for other months. In a multiple regression analysis temperature made the other 2 climatic variables redundant in accounting for variation in HA.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":112},"references":17,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
