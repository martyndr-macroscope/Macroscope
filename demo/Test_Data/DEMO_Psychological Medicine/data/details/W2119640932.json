In this study we investigated, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the white-matter microstructure organization in GAD. Method A total of 12 patients with DSM-IV GAD and 15 matched healthy controls underwent a magnetic resonance imaging session of diffusion weighted imaging, exploring white-matter water molecules by the means of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs). Regions of interests were placed in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes and in the splenium and genu of the corpus callosum, bilaterally. Results ADC measures were significantly greater in patients with GAD in the right splenium and right parietal cortex compared with healthy controls ( p ⩽0.002). No significant correlations between ADCs and age or clinical variables were found. Conclusions We provide evidence that GAD is associated with disrupted white-matter coherence of posterior right hemisphere regions, which may partly sustain the impaired cognitive regulation of anxiety. Future diffusion imaging investigations are expected to better elucidate the communication between the parietal cortex and other right hemisphere regions in sustaining the cognitive processing of social and emotional stimuli in patients with GAD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":35},"references":89,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
