A semistructured interview developed by Harris et al. (1986) was used to assess the childhood family environment of 64 patients with restricting anorexia nervosa (RAN), 23 patients with bulimic anorexia nervosa (BAN), 37 bulimic patients with a history of anorexia nervosa (BN/HistAN) and 79 patients with normal weight bulimia nervosa (BN). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of parental mental disorder, low parental control or childhood sexual abuse. BN patients had had significantly more family arrangements and had experienced more parental indifference, excessive parental control, physical abuse, and violence against other family members than RAN patients with the BAN and BN/HistAN group being intermediate. There was a trend for BN-patients to have had more intra-familial discord than the other groups. Different aspects of adversity tended to cluster in the same patients and 65% of the bulimic group had experienced two or more types of childhood adversity. These results suggest that childhood experiences contribute to the form of eating disorder which later develops.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":68},"references":48,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
