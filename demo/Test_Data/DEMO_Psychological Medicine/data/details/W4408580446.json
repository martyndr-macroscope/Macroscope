This study investigates the underexplored cognitive mechanisms of clozapine-induced OCS, particularly focusing on dysfunctional checking behavior. Methods Clinical and cognitive profiles of OCS and their relationship to dysfunctional checking were investigated using a novel checking paradigm (image verification task or IVT) in four groups: clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients with clozapine-induced OCS (SCZ-OCS, n = 21) and without (SCZ-only, n = 15), patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, n = 32) and IQ-matched healthy volunteers (HV, n = 30). Results Only SCZ-OCS patients showed a distinctive pattern of dysfunctional checking on the IVT. Compared with SCZ-OCS, SCZ-only patients exhibited functional checking while having equivalent deficits in executive cognition, clozapine dose, and treatment duration, though with less severe positive and depressive symptoms. In SCZ-OCS, dysfunctional checking was positively correlated with clozapine dose and working memory performance. By contrast, OCD patients’ checking was positively related to intolerance of uncertainty. Checking in the OCD and SCZ-OCS groups was positively correlated with YBOCS-compulsion. Conclusion This study is the first to compare the distinct cognitive and clinical profiles of SCZ-OCS, SCZ-only, and OCD, with a focus on checking behavior, a major symptom in clozapine-treated patients. We introduced a novel and sensitive measure for checking, which showed dysfunctional checking only in SCZ-OCS patients treated with clozapine. These findings indicate that a subset of patients with schizophrenia with more severe positive symptoms and cognitive deficits are especially susceptible to OCD symptoms when treated with clozapine.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":1},"references":60,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
