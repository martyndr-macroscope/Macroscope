These children received a paediatric evaluation consisting of a medical history, complete physical examination, chromosome analysis including 2 cells karyotyped and 15 counted, and sex chromatin studies. All gender disturbed boys were found to be normal genetically and physically with the exception of one subject with one undescended testicle.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":13},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
