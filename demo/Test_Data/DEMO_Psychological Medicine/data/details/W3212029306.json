We aimed to examine the most updated evidence on the effects of psychotherapy in patients with depression and somatic disorders, including HIV, oncological, cardiometabolic, and neurological disorders. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of 75 randomized trials (8209 participants) of psychotherapy for adults with somatic disorders and a diagnosis or elevated symptoms of depression. Outcomes included depression, QoL, somatic health-related outcomes, and mortality. Results Psychotherapy significantly reduced the severity of depression at post-treatment across all categories of somatic disorders (Hedges' g = 0.65; 95% CI 0.52–0.79), with sustained effects at 6–11 months ( g = 0.38; 95% CI 0.22–0.53) and at 12 months follow-up or longer ( g = 0.13; 95% CI 0.04–0.21). Psychotherapy also showed significant effects on QoL ( g = 0.26; 95% CI 0.17–0.35), maintained up to 11 months follow-up ( g = 0.25; 95% CI 0.16–0.34). No significant effects were observed on the most frequently reported somatic health-related outcomes (glycemic control, pain), and neither on mortality. Heterogeneity in most analyses was very high, and only 29 (38%) trials were rated at low risk of bias (RoB). Conclusions Psychotherapy may be an effective treatment option for patients with depression and somatic disorders, with long-term effects on depression severity and QoL. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneity and RoB.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":11},"references":43,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
