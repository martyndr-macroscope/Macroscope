While researchers suggested an association between changes of the cortical salience network (CSN) and delusion, whether these CSN findings are a cause or a consequence of delusion remains unknown. Method To assess the effect of CSN functioning to forthcoming changes in delusion scores, we measured brain activation with 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging in two independent samples of first-episode psychosis patients (total of 27 patients and 23 healthy controls). During scanning, the patients evaluated statements about whether an individual's psychosis-related experiences should be described as a mental illness, and control statements that were also evaluated by healthy controls. Symptoms were assessed at the baseline and at 2 months follow-up with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Results Both tasks activated the CSN in comparison with rest. Activation of CSN (‘illness evaluation v . control task’ contrast) in patients positively correlated with worsening of or less improvement in delusions at the 2-month follow-up assessment. This finding was independent of delusion and clinical insight scores at the baseline evaluation. Conclusions Our findings link symptom-evaluation-related CSN functioning to severity of delusion and, importantly, add a new layer of evidence for the contribution of CSN functioning to the longitudinal course of delusions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":19},"references":48,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
