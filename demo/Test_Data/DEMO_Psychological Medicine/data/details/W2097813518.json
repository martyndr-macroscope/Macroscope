Two highly correlated symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression are shown to underlie these disorders. Neurovegetative sysmptoms of depression are shown to be on the same dimension as psychic symptoms of depression, but to represent a more severe manifestation of depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":183},"references":21,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
