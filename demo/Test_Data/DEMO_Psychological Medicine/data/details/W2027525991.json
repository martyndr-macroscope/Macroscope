We investigated these possibilities both with respect to threatening and positive stimuli among traumatized individuals with and without PTSD. Method Twenty-two patients with PTSD, 21 trauma controls and 20 non-traumatized healthy participants were evaluated on two tasks. For one of these tasks, the affective Stroop task (aST), the emotional stimuli act as distracters and interfere with task performance. For the other, the emotional lexical decision task (eLDT), emotional information facilitates task performance. Results Compared to trauma controls and healthy participants, patients with PTSD showed increased interference for negative but not positive distracters on the aST and increased emotional facilitation for negative words on the eLDT. Conclusions These findings document that hyper-responsiveness to threat but not to positive stimuli is specific for patients with PTSD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":94},"references":55,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
