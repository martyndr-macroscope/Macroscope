Emphasis is laid on the memory disturbance and on the behavioural and emotional aberrations that tended to occur and that are in some ways reminiscent of the Klüver–Bucy syndrome.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":89},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
