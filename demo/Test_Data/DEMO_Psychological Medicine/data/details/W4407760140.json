Their synthesis has not been provided so far. A systematic review of studies using a network analysis to assess the dynamics of PLEs in community samples was performed. Altogether, 27 studies were included. The overall percentage ranks of centrality metrics for PLEs were 23.5% for strength (20 studies), 26.0% for betweenness (5 studies), 29.7% for closeness (6 studies), 26.9% for expected influence (7 studies), and 29.1% for bridge expected influence (3 studies). Included studies covered three topics: phenomenology of PLEs and associated symptom domains (14 studies), exposure to stress and PLEs (7 studies), and PLEs with respect to suicide-related outcomes (6 studies). Several other symptom domains were directly connected to PLEs. A total of 6 studies investigated PLEs with respect to childhood trauma (CT) history. These studies demonstrated that PLEs are directly connected to CT history (4 studies) or a cumulative measure of environmental exposures (1 study). Moreover, CT was found to moderate the association of PLEs with other symptom domains (1 study). Two studies that revealed direct connections of CT with PLEs also found potential mediating effects of cognitive biases and general psychopathology. PLEs were also directly connected to suicide-related outcomes across all studies included within this topic. The findings imply that PLEs are transdiagnostic phenomena that do not represent the most central domain of psychopathology in community samples. Their occurrence might be associated with CT and suicide risk.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":4},"references":111,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
