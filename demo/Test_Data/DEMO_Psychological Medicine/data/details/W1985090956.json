The death risk for patients with a diagnosis of neurosis is higher than that for the general population. Previous studies are enlisted to investigate this mortality for socio-economic characteristics, alcohol and drug abuse, psychopathy and accident proneness. Possible psychosomatic aetiology of disease and subsequent death is examined. Psychological theories for premature death are discussed and some recommendations made for future areas of enquiry.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":20},"references":84,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
