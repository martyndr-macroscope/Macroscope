Differences emerged in the relationship between stimulus intensity and response amplitude. It is suggested that patients with psychogenic pain tended to deal with small stimuli in the way in which the other groups of patients dealt with large stimuli.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":17},"references":28,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
