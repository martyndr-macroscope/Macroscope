The stability of the total CAMCOG score was high (0·97). Patients with less than moderate dementia were differentiated well by the total score and by subscales with a range of more than 8 points, except when education was low or age was higher than 78. Because performance on most (sub)scales is modified by age and education level, stratified norms are desirable. Only the Praxis subscale, and specifically performance on drawing tasks, appeared to be influenced by depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":61},"references":9,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
