We examined buffering effects associated with two forms of unit cohesion (peer-oriented horizontal cohesion and subordinate-leader vertical cohesion) defined as either individual-level or aggregated unit-level variables. Methods Longitudinal survey data from US Army soldiers who deployed to Afghanistan in 2012 were analyzed using mixed-effects regression. Models evaluated individual- and unit-level interaction effects of combat exposure and cohesion during deployment on symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and suicidal ideation reported at 3 months post-deployment (model n 's = 6684 to 6826). Given the small effective sample size ( k = 89), the significance of unit-level interactions was evaluated at a 90% confidence level. Results At the individual-level, buffering effects of horizontal cohesion were found for PTSD symptoms [ B = −0.11, 95% CI (−0.18 to −0.04), p &lt; 0.01] and depressive symptoms [ B = −0.06, 95% CI (−0.10 to −0.01), p &lt; 0.05]; while a buffering effect of vertical cohesion was observed for PTSD symptoms only [ B = −0.03, 95% CI (−0.06 to −0.0001), p &lt; 0.05]. At the unit-level, buffering effects of horizontal (but not vertical) cohesion were observed for PTSD symptoms [ B = −0.91, 90% CI (−1.70 to −0.11), p = 0.06], depressive symptoms [ B = −0.83, 90% CI (−1.24 to −0.41), p &lt; 0.01], and suicidal ideation [ B = −0.32, 90% CI (−0.62 to −0.01), p = 0.08]. Conclusions Policies and interventions that enhance horizontal cohesion may protect combat-exposed units against post-deployment mental health problems. Efforts to support individual soldiers who report low levels of horizontal or vertical cohesion may also yield mental health benefits.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":29},"references":43,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
