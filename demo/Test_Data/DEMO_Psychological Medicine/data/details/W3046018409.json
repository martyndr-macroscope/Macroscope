Previous computational modelling of depression and flanker task performance showed reduced pre-potent response bias and reduced executive control efficiency in depression. In the current study, we applied two computational models that account for the full dynamics of attentional selectivity. Method Across three large-scale online experiments (one exploratory experiment followed by two confirmatory – and pre-registered – experiments; total N = 923), we measured attentional selectivity via the flanker task and obtained measures of depression symptomology as well as anhedonia. We then fit two computational models that account for the dynamics of attentional selectivity: The dual-stage two-phase model, and the shrinking spotlight (SSP) model. Results No behavioural measures were related to depression symptomology or anhedonia. However, a parameter of the SSP model that indexes the strength of perceptual input was consistently negatively associated with the magnitude of depression symptomatology. Conclusions The findings provide evidence for deficits in perceptual representations in depression. We discuss the implications of this in relation to the hypothesis that perceptual deficits potentially exacerbate control deficits in depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":37,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
