Comparisons of these groups in terms of cognitive status showed that the BF placement, which avoided both temporal regions, spared both verbal and nonverbal functions. These differential effects, which were independent of the degree of clinical depression, were not, however, evident three months after the last ECT.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":99},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
