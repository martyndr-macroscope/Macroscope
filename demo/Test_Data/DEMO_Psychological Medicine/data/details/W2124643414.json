In individuals, stronger religious beliefs are associated with lower tolerance of suicide. Personal religious beliefs and, for men, exposure to a religious environment, may protect against suicide by reducing its acceptability.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":203},"references":12,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
