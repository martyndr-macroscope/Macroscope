They are of considerable importance cross-culturally (Ono et al . 1999), and often lie at the interface of psychiatry and medicine (Hickie, 1999). They are associated with significant disability (Ormel et al . 1994; Andrews, 2000) and health-care utilization (Escobar et al . 1991).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":18},"references":83,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
