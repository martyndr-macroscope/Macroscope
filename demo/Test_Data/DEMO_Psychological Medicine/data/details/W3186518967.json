Methods This study included all young adults in Sweden, aged 19–29 years, with an incident diagnosis of ADHD 2006–2011 ( n = 9718). Crude and multivariate sex-stratified hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were measured 5 years after the diagnosis of ADHD for the risk of disability pension, long-term sickness absence (SA) (&gt;90 days), long-term unemployment (&gt;180 days) and a combined measure of all three in young adults with ADHD compared to their siblings without ADHD and a matched comparison group. Results In the adjusted analyses young adults with ADHD had a 10-fold higher risk of disability pension (HR = 10.2; CI 9.3–11.2), a nearly three-fold higher risk of long-term SA (HR = 2.7; CI 2.5–2.8) and a 70% higher risk of long-term unemployment (HR = 1.7; CI 1.6–1.8) compared to the matched comparison group. The risk estimates were lower compared to siblings for disability pension (HR = 9.0; CI 6.6–12.3) and long-term SA (HR = 2.5; CI 2.1–3.1) but higher in the long-term unemployed (HR = 1.9; CI 1.6–2.1). Comorbid disorders explained about one-third of the association between ADHD and disability pension, but less regarding SA and long-term unemployment. Conclusions Young adults with ADHD have a high risk for different measures of LMM and comorbidities explain only a small proportion of this relationship.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":25},"references":30,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
