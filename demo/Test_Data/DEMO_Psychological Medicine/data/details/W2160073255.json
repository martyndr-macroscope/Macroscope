In contrast to previous studies, married and widowed women and mothers showed lower rates than the never married and childless women. A plausible explanation is provided by available analysis of New Zealand gender roles. Such an explanation would reconfirm the importance of socio-cultural factors in community psychiatric disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":60},"references":34,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
