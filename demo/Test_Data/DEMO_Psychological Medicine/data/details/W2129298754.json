Data were collected by questionnaire from couples expecting their first child, during pregnancy and after maternity leave, and from childless couples at two separate time points. The impact of the transition was minimal overall, although women experienced more pressure than men and there were some cases of extreme stress. New single-earner parents reported a greater decline in life satisfaction than dual-earners.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":36},"references":48,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
