To test this hypothesis, 3 aspects of EDA – skin conductance level (SCL), number of spontaneous fluctuations (SF), and skin conductance response (SCR) – were measured bilaterally in 10 patients who had undergone unilateral temporal lobectomy. No differences could be detected between the operated and non-operated sides within the patient group, nor between the patient and control groups. The implications of these findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":13},"references":31,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
