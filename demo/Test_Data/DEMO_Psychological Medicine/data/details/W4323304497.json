One-day cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based workshops for PPD have the potential to reach large numbers of sufferers and be integrated into stepped models of care. Methods This randomized controlled trial of 461 mothers and birthing parents in Ontario, Canada with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores ⩾10, age ⩾18 years, and an infant &lt;12 months of age compared the effects of a 1-day CBT-based workshop plus treatment as usual (TAU; i.e. care from any provider(s) they wished) to TAU alone at 12-weeks post-intervention on PPD, anxiety, the mother–infant relationship, offspring behavior, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Data were collected via REDCap. Results Workshops led to meaningful reductions in EPDS scores ( m = 15.77 to 11.22; b = −4.6, p &lt; 0.01) and were associated with three times higher odds of a clinically significant decrease in PPD [odds ratio (OR) 3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93–4.67]. Anxiety also decreased and participants had three times the odds of clinically significant improvement (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.03–5.04). Participants reported improvements in mother–infant bonding, infant-focused rejection and anger, and effortful control in their toddlers. The workshop plus TAU achieved similar quality-adjusted life-years at lower costs than TAU alone. Conclusions One-day CBT-based workshops for PPD can lead to improvements in depression, anxiety, and the mother–infant relationship and are cost-saving. This intervention could represent a perinatal-specific option that can treat larger numbers of individuals and be integrated into stepped care approaches at reasonable cost.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":21},"references":71,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
