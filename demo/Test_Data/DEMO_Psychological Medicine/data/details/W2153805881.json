From 24 hours to 14 days baseline serum prolactin levels rose towards a plateau, as did the improvement in clinical ratings. After the first intravenous test doses of haloperidol, prolactin levels peaked at 1 hour; however, they fell to a low point at 24 hours, and no response to further test doses was seen for 3–5 days. The response tended to return at 14 days. The mechanisms underlying the changes in prolactin levels, and in clinical state, are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":15},"references":39,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
