A significant positive correlation was detected between the EAT scores and the skin conductivity measures associated with the presentation of food. Women with the highest EAT scores also exhibited the greatest sympathetic nervous system responses to a plate of cookies. This finding supports the conclusion that the EAT is capable of identifying individuals who are preoccupied with food or anxious about eating.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":13,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
