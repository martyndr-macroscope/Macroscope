As a whole, patients were mildly to moderately depressed, being as depressed as anxious neurotics and less depressed than depressed neurotics. The more depressed patients showed a variety of characteristics, many of which have previously been shown to be indicators of poor prognosis. Over the course of treatment patients became less depressed. Weight gain was correlated with a decrease in depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":147},"references":29,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
