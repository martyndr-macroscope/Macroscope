With this method 267 subjects were studied, 182 of whom had been exposed to neuroleptics. The results were submitted to a principal components analysis and 3 movement dimensions emerged. One group of movements resembled a parkinsonian syndrome. The other 2 groups of movements both conformed to the generally accepted criteria for tardive dyskinesia. These groups were: (1) head and neck movements and (2) trunk and limb movements. The possibility of the second and third groups representing clinically relevant sub-syndromes of tardive dyskinesia is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":80},"references":22,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
