The items were assessed in terms of item–total correlations, test–retest reliabilities, correlations with indicators of current cognitive functioning and correlations with indicators of pre-morbid cognitive functioning. These data were used to develop a 16-item short form. The short form was cross-validated in a new sample using dementia/delirium diagnosis as the validity standard. It was found to perform as well as the long form.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":1181},"references":16,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
