However, it is unknown if effectiveness of psychotherapy is altered in depressed patients who display such features compared with those without. The current paper aimed to investigate the impact of the co-presence of subclinical psychotic experiences and subclinical bipolar symptoms on the effectiveness of psychological treatment, alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Method In a naturalistic study, patients with MDD ( n = 116) received psychological treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy) alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Depression and functioning were assessed six times over 2 years. Lifetime psychotic experiences and bipolar symptoms were assessed at the second time point. Results Subclinical psychotic experiences predicted more depression over time ( β = 0.20, p &lt; 0.002), non-remission [odds ratio (OR) 7.51, p &lt; 0.016] and relapse (OR 3.85, p &lt; 0.034). Subthreshold bipolar symptoms predicted relapse (OR 1.16, p &lt; 0.037). Conclusions In general, subclinical psychotic experiences have a negative impact on the course and outcome of psychotherapy in MDD. Effects of subclinical bipolar experiences were less prominent.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":55},"references":68,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
