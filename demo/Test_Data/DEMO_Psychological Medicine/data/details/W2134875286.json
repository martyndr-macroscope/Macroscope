(1983) employed Bell &amp; Byrne's (1978) Repression-Sensitization (R–S) scale to test the hypothesis that agoraphobics utilize repression as a method of avoiding anxiety-arousing forms of cognition. However, no support was found for this view. Rather, the R–S scores indicated general sensitization and attention to negative affect. In this paper it is argued that, on both theoretical and psychometric grounds, the R–S scale cannot be considered a suitable measure of the repression–sensitization process. A study was carried out in which a number of other defensivity measures were used in addition to the R–S scale. Weak support was found for Goldstein &amp; Chambless’ (1978) view that a defensive cognitive style is characteristic of agoraphobic patients when compared with non-phobic psychiatric controls.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":5},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
