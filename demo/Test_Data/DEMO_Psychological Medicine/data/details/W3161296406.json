EDs range in complexity and severity but can be life-threatening without appropriate treatment. Although it is well-known that quality of life impacts is high for ED sufferers, research regarding fiscal and related costs is severely limited. The aim of this study was to understand economic and other costs of EDs at the community level. Method Data were derived from 2017 household community representative structured interview of 2977 people aged ⩾ 15 years in South Australia. ED diagnoses, health systems, productivity, transaction, out-of-pocket expenses and other related costs of BN and BED were used to estimate the economic burden of EDs in South Australia. Results The annual total economic cost of EDs in 2018 was estimated at $84 billion for South Australia. This included $81 billion from the burden of disease as the result of years lived with disability (YLD) ($62 billion) and years of life lost ($19 billion). The health system costs, productivity and tax revenue loss to the Australian economy were estimated at $1 billion, $1.6 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. Conclusions The YLD average cost in 2018 in South Australia was $296 649 per person. This is two-thirds of the costs borne by individuals and the wider economy. Prevention and management initiatives for EDs need to take into account these costs when assessing their potential benefits.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":54},"references":52,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
