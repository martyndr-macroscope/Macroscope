Having a first baby, being unmarried and undergoing Caesarian section were all associated with an increased risk of admission; twin births, perinatal death and maternal age were not. It is difficult to account for these and other established relationships purely in psychological or purely in somatic terms, suggesting that influences of both kinds are probably involved in the genesis of puerperal disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":166},"references":27,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
