We investigated whether sex had a similar effect on developmental domains amongst boys and girls with a familial risk of schizophrenia (FHR-SZ), bipolar disorder (FHR-BP), and controls. Methods Through Danish registries, we identified 522 7-year-old children (242 girls) with FHR-SZ, FHR-BP, and controls. We assessed their performance within the domains of neurocognition, motor function, language, social cognition, social behavior, psychopathology, and home environment. Results FHR-SZ boys compared with FHR-SZ girls had a higher proportion of disruptive behavior and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and exhibited lower performance in manual dexterity, balance, and emotion recognition. No sex differences were found between boys and girls within FHR-BP group. Compared with controls, both FHR-SZ boys and FHR-SZ girls showed impaired processing speed and working memory, had lower levels of global functioning, and were more likely to live in an inadequate home environment. Compared with control boys, FHR-SZ boys showed impaired manual dexterity, social behavior, and social responsiveness, and had a higher proportion of ADHD and disruptive behavior disorder diagnoses. Stress and adjustment disorders were more common in FHR-BP boys compared with control boys. We found no differences between FHR-BP girls and control girls. Conclusions Impairment within neurodevelopmental domains associated within FHR-SZ boys v. FHR-SZ girls was most evident among boys, whereas no sex differences were found within the FHR-BP group (FHR-BP boys v. FHR-BP girls). FHR-SZ boys exhibited the highest proportion of early developmental impairments.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":97,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
