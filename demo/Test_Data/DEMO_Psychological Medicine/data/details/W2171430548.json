Optimal indices of validity were obtained by the use of the 60-item version of the GHQ and a cut-off score of 13/14. The product-moment correlation coefficients between clinical ratings of severity of mental impairment and GHQ scores ranged from 0·71 to 0·78.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":83},"references":6,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
