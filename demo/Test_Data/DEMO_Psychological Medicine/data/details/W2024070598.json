A third ‘schizoaffective’ subtype, whose existence was less clear cut, was almost entirely confined to females and characterized by dysphoria and persecutory delusions, and had negligible familial risk of schizophrenia. The aetiological, biological and clinical significance of this typology remains to be tested.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":87},"references":67,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
