Much work, however, would need to be done before it could take its place alongside mental abnormality as an excusing condition in the courts. The implications of such a plea would, moreover, be far reaching, two of the more obvious being the individualization of excuses and the relinquishing of the general preventive possibilities of punishment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":4,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
