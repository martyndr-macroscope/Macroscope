Hence, guidelines, emphasize the importance of SSP. The present study investigates the practice of SSP in current trials for depression. Methods Seventy-eight randomized controlled trials published between 2013 and 2017 were examined. Impact of study design (e.g. number of randomized conditions) and study context (e.g. funding) on sample size was analyzed using multiple regression. Results Overall, sample size during pre-registration, during SSP, and in published articles was highly correlated ( r 's ≥ 0.887). Simultaneously, only 7–18% of explained variance related to study design ( p = 0.055–0.155). This proportion increased to 30–42% by adding study context ( p = 0.002–0.005). The median sample size was N = 106, with higher numbers for internet interventions ( N = 181; p = 0.021) compared to face-to-face therapy. In total, 59% of studies included SSP, with 28% providing basic determinants and 8–10% providing information for comprehensible SSP. Expected effect sizes exhibited a sharp peak at d = 0.5. Depending on the definition, 10.2–20.4% implemented intense assessment to improve statistical power. Conclusions Findings suggest that investigators achieve their determined sample size and pre-registration rates are increasing. During study planning, however, study context appears more important than study design. Study context, therefore, needs to be emphasized in the present discussion, as it can help understand the relatively stable trial numbers of the past decades. Acknowledging this situation, indications exist that digital psychiatry (e.g. Internet interventions or intense assessment) can help to mitigate the challenge of underpowered studies. The article includes a short guide for efficient study planning.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":17},"references":39,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
