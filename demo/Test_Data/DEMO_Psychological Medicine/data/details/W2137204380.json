Ethacrynate or different potassium concentrations were used to increase cell sodium concentration. The lymphocytes of manic depressives had a significantly reduced ability to produce new pump sites. It is suggested that this may be the genetic defect underlying manic depressive psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":56},"references":13,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
