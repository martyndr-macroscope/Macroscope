The findings in general are quite inconsistent; this is due in part to the methodological limitations of most studies, principally that of inadequate control of potentially confounding variables. Where experimental and control samples were most rigorously matched, no association was found between childhood parental bereavement and depression in later life. Parental death in childhood appears to have little effect on adult depressive morbidity.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":144},"references":63,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
