Such a ‘specificity’ effect is confirmed in our current sample of 65 melancholic and 84 non-melancholic depressed patients. Secondly, we examine the risk to depression effected by exposure to one parent with an anomalous parental style, and the extent to which that risk is modified by characteristics of the other parent. We find clear evidence of additive effects with the risk to non-melancholic depression being raised by exposure to ‘anomalous parenting’ from two parents. Of the varying parental styles measured by the PBI, low parental care from both parents provided the highest risk to non-melancholic depression (being 4–7 time higher in one sample and 13–27 times higher in the other).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":65},"references":11,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
