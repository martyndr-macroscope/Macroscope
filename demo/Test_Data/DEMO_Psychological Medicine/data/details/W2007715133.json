Patients on pimozide were significantly more favourably rated on aspects of sociability, use of leisure, warmth of personal relationships, household tasks and child-rearing. The mode of production of this result is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":51},"references":19,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
