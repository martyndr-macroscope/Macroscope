Auditory-based targeted cognitive training (TCT) is a ‘bottom up’ intervention designed to enhance the speed and accuracy of auditory information processing, which has been shown to improve neurocognition in certain SZ patients. However, the dynamics of TCT learning as a function of training exercises and their impact on neurocognitive functioning and therapeutic outcomes are unknown. Methods Forty subjects (SZ, n = 21; healthy subjects (HS), n = 19) underwent comprehensive clinical, cognitive, and auditory assessments, including measurements of auditory processing speed (APS) at baseline and after 1-h of TCT. SZ patients additionally completed 30-hours of TCT and repeated assessments ~10–12 weeks later. Results SZ patients were deficient in APS at baseline ( d = 0.96, p &lt; 0.005) relative to HS. After 1-h of TCT, analyses revealed significant main effects of diagnosis ( d = 1.75, p = 0.002) and time ( d = 1.04, p &lt; 0.001), and a diagnosis × time interaction ( d = 0.85, p = 0.02) on APS. APS learning effects were robust after 1-h in SZ patients ( d = 1.47, p &lt; 0.001) and persisted throughout the 30-h of training. Baseline APS was associated with verbal learning gains after 30-h of TCT ( r = 0.51, p = 0.02) in SZ. Conclusions TCT learning metrics may have prognostic utility and aid in the prospective identification of individuals likely to benefit from TCT. Future experimental medicine studies may advance predictive algorithms that enhance TCT-related clinical, cognitive and functional outcomes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":59,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
