Although the frequency of discontinuing LAP was appreciably less than reported in most surveys on oral medication, it remained a problem. An analysis of the reasons for patients discontinuing LAP identified several causes: patient-refusal, side-effects, failure of administration of the regime, and patients losing contact with the medical services by moving to other districts.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":55},"references":15,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
