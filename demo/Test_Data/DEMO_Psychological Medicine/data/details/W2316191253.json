However, it is unknown whether cognitive effects of MPH depend on age in individuals with ADHD, while animal studies have suggested age-related effects. In this meta-analysis, we first determined the effects of MPH on response inhibition, working memory and sustained attention, but our main goal was to examine whether these effects are moderated by age. A systematic literature search using PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and MEDLINE for double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with MPH resulted in 25 studies on response inhibition ( n = 775), 13 studies on working memory ( n = 559) and 29 studies on sustained attention ( n = 956) (mean age range 4.8–50.1 years). The effects of MPH on response inhibition [effect size ( ES ) = 0.40, p &lt; 0.0001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22–0.58], working memory ( ES = 0.24, p = 0.053, 95% CI 0.00–0.48) and sustained attention ( ES = 0.42, p &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI 26–0.59) were small to moderate. No linear or quadratic age-dependencies were observed, indicating that effects of MPH on executive functions are independent of age in children and adults with ADHD. However, adolescent studies are lacking and needed to conclude a lack of an age-dependency across the lifespan.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":70},"references":104,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
