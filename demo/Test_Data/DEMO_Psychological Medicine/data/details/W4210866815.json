We studied the association between a schizophrenia risk locus involving a 6.1Mb homozygous region on chromosome 13q22–31 in a consanguineous multiplex family and cognitive functioning, haemodynamic response and white matter integrity using neuroimaging. Methods We performed CANTAB neuropsychological testing on four affected family members (all homozygous for the risk locus), ten unaffected family members (seven homozygous and three heterozygous) and ten healthy volunteers, and tested neuronal responses on fMRI during an n-back working memory task, and white matter integrity on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on four affected and six unaffected family members (four homozygous and two heterozygous) and three healthy volunteers. For cognitive comparisons we used a linear mixed model (Kruskal–Wallis) test, followed by posthoc Dunn's pairwise tests with a Bonferroni adjustment. For fMRI analysis, we counted voxels exceeding the p &lt; 0.05 corrected threshold. DTI analysis was observational. Results Family members with schizophrenia and unaffected family members homozygous for the risk haplotype showed attention ( p &lt; 0.01) and working memory deficits ( p &lt; 0.01) compared with healthy controls; a neural activation laterality bias towards the right prefrontal cortex (voxels reaching p &lt; 0.05, corrected) and observed lower fractional anisotropy in the anterior cingulate cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Conclusions In this family, homozygosity at the 13q risk locus was associated with impaired cognition, white matter integrity, and altered laterality of neural activation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":52,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
