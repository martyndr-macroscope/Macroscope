However, EMA’s reliance on active self-reporting introduces challenges, including participant burden and reduced response rates during crises. This study explores the potential of Screenomics—a passive digital phenotyping method that captures intensive, real-time smartphone screenshots—to detect suicide risk through text-based analysis. Method Seventy-nine participants with past-month suicidal ideation or behavior completed daily EMA prompts and provided smartphone data over 28 days, resulting in approximately 7.5 million screenshots. Text from screenshots was analyzed using a validated dictionary encompassing suicide-related and general risk language. Results Results indicated significant associations between passive and active suicidal ideation and suicide planning with specific language patterns. Detection of words related to suicidal thoughts and general risk-related words strongly correlated with self-reported suicide risk, with distinct between- and within-person effects highlighting the dynamic nature of suicide risk factors. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging smartphone text data for real-time suicide risk detection, offering a scalable, low-burden alternative to traditional methods. Findings suggest that dynamic, individualized monitoring via passive data collection could enhance suicide prevention efforts by enabling timely, tailored interventions. Future research should refine language models and explore diverse populations to extend the generalizability of this innovative approach.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":59,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
