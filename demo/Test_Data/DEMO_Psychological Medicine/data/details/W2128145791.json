A variety of definitions of depression were applied to the co-twins all of which resulted in (a) markedly higher rates of disorder than are found in the general population, (b) significantly higher monozygotic than dizygotic concordance. The results of applying a simple additive model in which depression is considered as a threshold trait suggested that both genetic factors and shared family environment make substantial and significant contributions to the familiality of depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":111},"references":30,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
