This saccadic distractibility has previously been found in patients with lesions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, implicating an abnormality of prefrontal cortex. The objective of the present study was to determine the contribution of these and other areas to the ANTI-saccadic abnormality in schizophrenia by functional neuroimaging. Using 99m technetium-HMPAO high resolution multidetector single-photon emission tomography, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during performance of the ANTI-saccade eye-movement task was compared, by statistical parametric mapping, in ten male schizophrenic patients on stable antipsychotic medication who had a high distractibility error rate on the task, and eight similar patients who had normal distractibility error rates. Compared with the normal error group, the patients with high error rates showed significantly decreased rCBF bilaterally, in the anterior cingulate, insula, and in left striatum. These same patients also had increased perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sort Test.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":63},"references":74,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
