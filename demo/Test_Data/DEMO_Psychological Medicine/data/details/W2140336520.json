The data show excellent construct validity and good but not high internal consistency (0·77–0·81) and test-retest (0·72–0·74) reliability. Interrater reliability ranged from 0·94 to 0·98. Correlations of PSE output with other psychological and physiological measures (criterion-related validity) was very poor.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":11},"references":23,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
