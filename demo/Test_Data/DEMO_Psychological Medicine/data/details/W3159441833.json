Investigating educational achievement in the first episode of psychosis (FEP) patients may shed light on the origins of the alterations and on the variability of outcomes in psychotic disorders. Methods Education achievement was explored in a large sample ( n = 659) of FEP patients enrolled in programa de atención a fases iniciales de psicosis (PAFIP), a research and assistance program conducted in Spain. Patients were stratified according to the Spanish educational system according to their attendance in primary (low), secondary (medium) or university studies (high). The three groups were compared on available premorbid, clinical and neuropsychological variables. A subgroup of patients ( n = 209), comprising the 10-year follow-up PAFIP cohort, were again compared. Results Overall, 49% and 37% of FEP patients had low and medium levels of education, respectively. In total, 13% of the patients with a higher level of education were more frequently women (64%) and older at illness onset (36 years old), reported better premorbid adjustment, presented less severe positive symptoms and better functioning; and showed higher premorbid intelligence quotient and better performance on all the explored cognitive domains. Ten years later the FEP patients in the medium- and high-education groups had good global functioning and a neurocognitive performance within the normal limits. Conclusions Higher education is associated with better initial conditions and more favourable outcomes after an FEP. Sharing this information with the world's educational systems is essential to targeting resources and designing innovative programs or strategies to compensate for student difficulties.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":20},"references":53,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
