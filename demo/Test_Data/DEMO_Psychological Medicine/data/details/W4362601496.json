We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies testing factors associated with UM as compared to bipolar disorder with a manic-depressive course (md-BD). Methods Studies indexed up to July 2022 in main electronic databases were searched. Random-effects meta-analyses of the association between UM and relevant correlates yielded odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Based on data from 21 studies, factors positively or negatively associated with UM, as compared to md-BD, were: male gender (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.11–1.94); age at onset (SMD −0.25; 95% CI −0.46 to −0.04); number of hospitalizations (SMD 0.53; 95% CI 0.21–0.84); family history of depression (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.36–0.85); suicide attempts (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.19–0.34); comorbid anxiety disorders (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.26–0.49); psychotic features (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.55–3.00); hyperthymic temperament (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.17–3.40). The quality of evidence for the association with previous suicide attempts was high, moderate for anxiety disorders and psychotic features, and low or very low for other correlates. Conclusions Despite the heterogeneous quality of evidence, this work supports the hypothesis that UM might represent a distinctive diagnostic construct, with peculiar clinical correlates. Additional research is needed to better differentiate UM in the context of affective disorders, favouring personalized care approaches.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":11},"references":74,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
