Excluded amino acids could be made to enter the brain by raising their concentration in the bloodstream. The possible relevance of these findings to improvements in the dietary treatment of some inborn errors of metabolism is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":24},"references":32,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
