Using the psychiatric case-registers in both areas, the patterns of care in 2 years of follow-up of schizophrenic patients were constructed. Survival analysis was used to analyse in-, day- and out-patient episodes of care. Three-quarters of the Groningen and half of the South-Verona patients experienced at least one episode of hospitalization; 20% of the Groningen and 5% of the South-Verona patients were long-stay patients at the end of the observation period. The South-Verona patients had more episodes of in-patient and especially of day-patient and out-patient care. Cox's regression showed that the duration of episodes controlled for the history of events and sociodemographic characteristics, was significantly shorter in South-Verona. One of the main conclusion was that hospitalizations for the severely mental ill are also needed in a community-based system of care, supporting the assumption of a ‘bed-rock’ of mental illness. However, the South-Verona community mental health service seems to be able to reduce the duration of hospitalizations considerably.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":50},"references":32,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
