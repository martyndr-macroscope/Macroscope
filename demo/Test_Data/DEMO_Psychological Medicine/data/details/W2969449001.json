Of all the putative risk factors associated with psychosis, being at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) has the strongest association with the onset of psychosis, and exposure to childhood trauma has been linked to an increased risk of development of psychotic disorder. We aimed to investigate whether being at-risk for psychosis and exposure to childhood trauma were associated with altered endocannabinoid levels. Method We compared 33 CHR participants with 58 healthy controls (HC) and collected information about previous exposure to childhood trauma as well as plasma samples to analyse endocannabinoid levels. Results Individuals with both CHR and experience of childhood trauma had higher N- palmitoylethanolamine ( p &lt; 0.001) and anandamide ( p &lt; 0.001) levels in peripheral blood compared to HC and those with no childhood trauma. There was also a significant correlation between N- palmitoylethanolamine levels and symptoms as well as childhood trauma. Conclusions Our results suggest an association between CHR and/or childhood maltreatment and elevated endocannabinoid levels in peripheral blood, with a greater alteration in those with both CHR status and history of childhood maltreatment compared to those with either of those risks alone. Furthermore, endocannabinoid levels increased linearly with the number of risk factors and elevated endocannabinoid levels correlated with the severity of CHR symptoms and extent of childhood maltreatment. Further studies in larger cohorts, employing longitudinal designs are needed to confirm these findings and delineate the precise role of endocannabinoid alterations in the pathophysiology of psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":21},"references":58,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
