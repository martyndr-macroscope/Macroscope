Four standardized diagnostic definitions (PSE, DSM-III, ICD-9, Feighner) were applied to all subjects who were classified as schizophrenic or not schizophrenic according to each definition. Non-schizophrenic psychiatric disorders which have been shown to be familially associated with schizophrenia were also identified. Twenty blood markers were ascertained for all subjects and evidence of co-segregation with schizophrenia was sought. No selective segregation was found and therefore there was no evidence suggesting linkage or supporting a monogenic theory of transmission of susceptibility to schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":24},"references":20,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
