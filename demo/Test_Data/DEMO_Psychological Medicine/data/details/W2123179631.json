Particular difficulties might be expected in the processing of counterfactual information such as sarcasm or lies. Method The present study included 50 schizophrenia or schizo-affective out-patients and 44 demographically comparable healthy adults who were administered Part III of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT; a measure assessing comprehension of sarcasm versus lies) as well as measures of positive and negative symptoms and community functioning. Results TASIT data were analyzed using a 2 (group: patients versus healthy adults)×2 (condition: sarcasm versus lie) repeated-measures ANOVA. The results show significant effects for group, condition, and the group×condition interaction. Compared to controls, patients performed significantly worse on sarcasm but not lie scenes. Within-group contrasts showed that patients performed significantly worse on sarcasm versus lie scenes; controls performed comparably on both. In patients, performance on TASIT showed a significant correlation with positive, but not negative, symptoms. The group and interaction effects remained significant when rerun with a subset of patients with low-level positive symptoms. The findings for a relationship between TASIT performance and community functioning were essentially negative. Conclusions The findings replicate a prior demonstration of difficulty in the comprehension of sarcasm using a different test, but are not consistent with previous studies showing global ToM deficits in schizophrenia.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":79},"references":60,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
