This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of a novel transdiagnostic internet-delivered psychological intervention for adults with neurological disorders. Methods 221 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or an acquired brain injury were allocated to either an immediate treatment group ( n = 115) or treatment-as-usual waitlist control ( n = 106). The intervention, the Wellbeing Neuro Course, was delivered online via the eCentreClinic website. The Course includes six lessons, based on cognitive behavioural therapy, delivered over 10 weeks with support from a psychologist via email and telephone. Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Results 215 participants commenced the trial (treatment n = 111; control n = 104) and were included in intention-to-treat analysis. At post-treatment, we observed significant between-group differences in depression (PHQ-9; difference = 3.07 [95% CI 2.04–4.11], g = 0.62), anxiety (GAD-7; difference = 1.87 [0.92–2.81], g = 0.41) and disability (WHODAS 2.0 difference = 3.08 [1.09–5.06], g = 0.31), that favoured treatment (all ps &lt; 0.001). Treatment-related effects were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Findings were achieved with minimal clinician time (average of 95.7 min [ s.d. = 59.3] per participant), highlighting the public health potential of this approach to care. No adverse treatment events were reported. Conclusions Internet-delivered psychological interventions could be a suitable model of accessible supportive care for patients with neurological disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":10},"references":40,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
