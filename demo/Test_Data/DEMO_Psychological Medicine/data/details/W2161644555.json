Hippocampus (anterior and posterior, right and left), amygdala, entorhinal cortex, para-hippocampal gyrus and cerebral cortex were rated for atrophy on a 4-point scale. Good discrimination between groups could be achieved using a cut-off of 2 or more on anterior hippocampal atrophy rating (sensitivity 93%; specificity 84%; 89% cases correctly grouped overall). Even among a subgroup of 9 mild AD subjects and 10 cognitively impaired DEP subjects (matched on mini-mental state score), the same cut-off correctly grouped 84% (16/19) cases. Hippocampal atrophy increased with age in both AD and DEP subjects leading to a reduction in specificity (but not sensitivity) for those aged over 75. Within the AD group a significant correlation was observed between length of history and atrophy of the entorhinal cortex ( r = 0·39, P = 0·009). We conclude that temporal lobe atrophy on MRI can provide good discrimination between AD and DEP subjects, including those DEP patients with cognitive impairment apparent on screening tests of cognitive function.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":56},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
