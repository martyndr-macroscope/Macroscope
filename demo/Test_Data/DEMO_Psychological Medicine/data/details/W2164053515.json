Compared with controls, LLPDD subjects had less compulsive but more passive/aggressive and borderline/cycloid traits, and more depression and hypomania. Menstrual-cycle phase did not significantly affect personality variables in either group. In particular, depression and hypomania in LLPDD subjects suggests a relationship with affective disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":18},"references":32,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
