The results of the present study show that the absence of the primacy effect in DAT patients is related to list length but probably in a way that is qualitatively not specific since it follows the same pattern as in normal ageing. It is also demonstrated that DAT patients differ in learning style. It is suggested that this indicates a reduced capacity to maintain controlled processing.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":12},"references":18,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
