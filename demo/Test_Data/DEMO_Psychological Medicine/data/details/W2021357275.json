Ten per cent of the consultants who saw relevant age groups had no patients for abortion assessment in 1970, while 5% had 100 or more (mean estimated number = 26). The process of referral, consultation, decision-making, and follow-up is looked at, as are the psychiatrists' views on abortion. Their views and practices are seen to vary with their religion and with their links with teaching hospitals, although not with their age, sex, or marital status.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":10,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
