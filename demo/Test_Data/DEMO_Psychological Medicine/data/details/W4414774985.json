A potential neurobiological mechanism underlying for this heterogeneous pattern may involve the structural and functional organization of cortical connectivity networks, which could mediate the propagation of neuroanatomical alterations. Here, we aimed to explore how brain network architecture constrains cortical thickness alterations and their clinical relevance. Methods The 3D-T1 images were acquired from 139 patients with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and 119 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. We first characterized distributed cortical thinning patterns in patients with MUD, then evaluated the relationships between regional atrophy and (1) multimodal nodal centrality measures (structural, morphological, and functional) and (2) atrophy profiles of structural connected neighbors. Individual network-weighted cortical abnormality maps were used to identify distinct MUD biotypes and related to clinical features through k-means clustering and partial least squares regression. Results Cortical thinning patterns demonstrated significant associations with nodal centrality across all modalities, as well as cortical thinning of connected neighbors revealing a network-dependent atrophy architecture. Fronto-temporal regions emerged as critical epicenters, showing both high nodal centrality and strong correlations with connected neighbors’ thinning severity. We found that the individual differences in network-weighted cortical abnormality corresponded to clinical symptom variability, and distinguished two MUD biotypes associated with drug use. Conclusions Our findings suggest that cortical thinning in MUD is influenced by the brain connectome architecture, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding individual variability in addiction progression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":53,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
