Factor analysis ( N = 749) yielded a major dieting factor almost identical to that found by Garner et al. (1982) with anorexics. Although this factor clearly measures pathology in underweight girls, its interpretation is ambiguous for normal and overweight girls. Two other factors found in all analyses were food preoccupation and social pressure to eat.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":83},"references":14,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
