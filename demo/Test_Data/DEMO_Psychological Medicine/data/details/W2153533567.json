Method We used the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to examine the prevalence and correlates of retrospectively reported CD within Asians and NH/PI (18 years and older). We also completed logistic regressions to explore factors associated with CD within Asians ( n =1093) and, separately, NH/PI ( n =139) and to explain racial differences in CD prevalence. Results Asians were about a third as likely [odds ratio (OR) 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22–0.58] whereas NH/PI were about two and half times more likely (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.31–5.06) to have had CD compared with Caucasian respondents. Within Asians and NH/PI, CD was strongly associated with adult antisocial behavior, substance use and affective disorders. Demographic factors, the age that subjects came to the USA, measures of family environment and family history could not explain the observed differences in prevalence of CD for NH/PI relative to Caucasians. Conclusions Asian and NH/PI youth with CD represent a subgroup of Asian youth at very high risk for a number of serious psychiatric disorders. Further investigation is needed to explain the high CD prevalence among NH/PI.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":33},"references":55,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
