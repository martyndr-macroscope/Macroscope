The results of serum electrolyte, glucose and other screening tests in these patients are presented. Electrolyte abnormalities were found in 82 of the 168 patients (48·8%) who were diagnosed as having either bulimia or atypical eating disorder. The most common abnormality was metabolic alkalosis (27·4%); hypochloremia (23·8%) and hypokalemia (13·7%) were also commonly seen. No significant blood sugar abnormalities were encountered. An elevated serum amylase level was found to be associated with frequent binge-eating and vomiting behaviour. The pathophysiology of electrolyte abnormalities in this patient group is briefly reviewed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":121},"references":25,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
