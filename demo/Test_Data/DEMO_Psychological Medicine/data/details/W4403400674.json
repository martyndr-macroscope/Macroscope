In this retrospective population-based study, we aimed to examine the association of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with depressive symptoms, distinguishing self-reported v . biologically confirmed COVID-19. Methods 32 007 participants from the SAPRIS survey nested in the French CONSTANCES cohort were included. COVID-19 was measured as followed: ad hoc serologic testing, self-reported PCR or serology positive test results, and self-reported COVID-19. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center of Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Outcomes were depressive symptoms (total CES-D score, its four dimensions, and clinically significant depressive symptoms) and exposure was prior COVID-19 (no COVID-19/self-reported unconfirmed COVID-19/biologically confirmed COVID-19). Results In comparison to participants without COVID-19, participants with self-reported unconfirmed COVID-19 and biologically confirmed COVID-19 had higher CES-D scores ( β for one interquartile range increase [95% CI]: 0.15 [0.08–0.22] and 0.09 [0.05–0.13], respectively) and somatic complaints dimension scores (0.15 [0.09–0.21] and 0.10 [0.07–0.13]). Only those with self-reported but unconfirmed COVID-19 had higher depressed affect dimension scores (0.08 [0.01–0.14]). Accounting for ad hoc serologic testing only, the CES-D score and the somatic complaints dimension were only associated with the combination of self-reported COVID-19 and negative serology test results. Conclusions The association between COVID-19 and depressive symptoms was merely driven by somatic symptoms of depression and did not follow a gradient consistent with the hypothesis of a direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the risk of depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":48,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
