The observed abnormalities may be trait or state related, an issue that needs to be addressed with longitudinal study designs. The possible role of medication as a confounding variable requires further exploration.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":165},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
