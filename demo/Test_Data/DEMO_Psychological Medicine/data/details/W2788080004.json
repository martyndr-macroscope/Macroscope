Method Males from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD) ( N = 285) were assessed seven times from age 8 to 48 years to prospectively investigate the association between cannabis use and risk of major depressive disorder (MDD). A combination of multiple analyses (logistic regression, Cox regression, fixed-effects analysis) was employed to explore the strength and direction of effect within different developmental stages. Results Multiple regression analyses revealed that early-onset cannabis use (before age 18) but not late-onset cannabis use (after age 27) was associated with a higher risk and shorter time until a subsequent MDD diagnosis. This effect was present in high-frequency [(odds ratio (OR) 8.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29–70.79]; [hazard ratio (HR) 8.69, 95% CI 2.07–36.52)] and low-frequency early-onset users (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.22–4.76; HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.16–3.74). Effect of increased frequency of cannabis use on increased risk of subsequent MDD was observed only for use during adolescence (age 14–18) but not at later life stages, while controlling for observed and non-unobserved time-invariant factors. Conversely, MDD in adulthood (age 18–32) was linked to a reduction in subsequent cannabis use (age 32–48). Conclusions The present findings provide evidence implicating frequent cannabis use during adolescence as a risk factor for later life depression. Future studies should further examine causality of effects in larger samples.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":76},"references":36,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
