A number of pre-treatment measures were studied to determine which factors were predictive of treatment outcome. While age and chronicity were not predictive, the quality of the general relationship and measures of sexual attitude did give useful indications of likely outcome.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":8,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
