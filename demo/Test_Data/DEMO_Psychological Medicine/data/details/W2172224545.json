Plasma melatonin concentrations were measured throughout the night at 0, 1, 7 and 21 days and were higher during treatment with (+)oxaprotiline than with (−)oxaprotiline for the entire three weeks of treatment. Since NA stimulates the production and secretion of melatonin, these results are consistent with a sustained increase in noradrenergic activity within the pineal, during 21 days of treatment with an effective NA uptake inhibitor.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":17},"references":50,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
