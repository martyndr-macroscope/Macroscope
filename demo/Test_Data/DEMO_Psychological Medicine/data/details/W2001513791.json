The results indicate (1) that in PAD patients and their first-degree relatives the frequency of low N l -MN excretion was significantly higher ( p &lt; 0001) than in healthy controls and in patients with secondary affective disorders, and (2) that PAD patients have a consistently low N 1 -MN output, at all times constant and independent of the clinical phases of the disease. These findings provide evidence that the low N 1 -MN levels may represent an index of a biological background linked to a high morbidity risk for primary affective disorders. The theoretical implications deriving from these data are briefly discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":15},"references":3,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
