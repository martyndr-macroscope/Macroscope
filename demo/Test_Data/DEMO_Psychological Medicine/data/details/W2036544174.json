Although before treatment bulimic anorexics displayed more overall psychopathology than non-bulimics, many of the differences disappeared with treatment. There was no difference in severity of depression or body size estimation in these groups both before and with treatment. There was no difference in treatment response as measured by rate of weight gain. More expression of discomfort by bulimic anorexics during the acute phase of illness may in part account for some described differences in these two groups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":20},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
