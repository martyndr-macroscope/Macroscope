It is unclear whether problems persist after PTSD symptoms remit. Methods Data came from 12 270 trauma-exposed women in the Nurses' Health Study II. Trauma and PTSD symptoms were assessed using validated scales to determine PTSD status as of 2008 (trauma/no PTSD, remitted PTSD, unresolved PTSD) and symptom severity (lifetime and past-month). Starting in 2014, cognitive function was assessed using the Cogstate Brief Battery every 6 or 12 months for up to 24 months. PTSD associations with baseline cognition and longitudinal cognitive changes were estimated by covariate-adjusted linear regression and linear mixed-effects models, respectively. Results Compared to women with trauma/no PTSD, women with remitted PTSD symptoms had a similar cognitive function at baseline, while women with unresolved PTSD symptoms had worse psychomotor speed/attention and learning/working memory. In women with unresolved PTSD symptoms, past-month PTSD symptom severity was inversely associated with baseline cognition. Over follow-up, both women with remitted and unresolved PTSD symptoms in 2008, especially those with high levels of symptoms, had a faster decline in learning/working memory than women with trauma/no PTSD. In women with remitted PTSD symptoms, higher lifetime PTSD symptom severity was associated with a faster decline in learning/working memory. Results were robust to the adjustment for sociodemographic, biobehavioral, and health factors and were partially attenuated when adjusted for depression. Conclusion Unresolved but not remitted PTSD was associated with worse cognitive function assessed six years later. Accelerated cognitive decline was observed among women with either unresolved or remitted PTSD symptoms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":5},"references":79,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
