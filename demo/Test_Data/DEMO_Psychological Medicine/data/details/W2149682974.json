Of 480 psychiatric patients 93.3% had symptom patterns conforming to the model. It was additionally found that single syndrome patterns, within a particular class, occurred significantly more often in those not classifiable in any higher class. Finally, the relationship between each possible pair of the 12 syndromes was examined. Some of the implications of the model and the data are discussed in terms of the development, remission, assessment, and treatment of personal illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":18,"cited_by_count":222},"references":10,"networkCitations":18,"seed":false}
