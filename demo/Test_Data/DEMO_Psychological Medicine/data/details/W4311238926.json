Little is known about the persistence of self-reported and performance-based cognition with depression and functional outcomes. Methods This is a secondary analysis of a prospective naturalistic observational clinical cohort study of individuals with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD; N = 623). Participants completed app-based self-reported and performance-based cognitive function assessments alongside validated measures of depression, functional disability, and self-esteem every 3 months. Participants were followed-up for a maximum of 2-years. Multilevel hierarchically nested modelling was employed to explore between- and within-participant variation over time to identify whether persistent cognitive difficulties are related to levels of depression and functional impairment during follow-up. Results 508 individuals (81.5%) provided data (mean age: 46.6, s.d. : 15.6; 76.2% female). Increasing persistence of self-reported cognitive difficulty was associated with higher levels of depression and functional impairment throughout the follow-up. In comparison to low persistence of objective cognitive difficulty (&lt;25% of timepoints), those with high persistence (&gt;75% of timepoints) reported significantly higher levels of depression ( B = 5.17, s.e. = 2.21, p = 0.019) and functional impairment ( B = 4.82, s.e. = 1.79, p = 0.002) over time. Examination of the individual cognitive modules shows that persistently impaired executive function is associated with worse functioning, and poor processing speed is particularly important for worsened depressive symptoms. Conclusions We replicated previous findings of greater persistence of cognitive difficulty with increasing severity of depression and further demonstrate that these cognitive difficulties are associated with pervasive functional disability. Difficulties with cognition may be an indicator and target for further treatment input.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":23},"references":44,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
