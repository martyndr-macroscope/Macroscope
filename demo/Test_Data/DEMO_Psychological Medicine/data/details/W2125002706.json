This paper presents the results of further investigations of body perception amongst anorexic and normal females. The results, in contrast to earlier findings, indicate no such difference between groups. Detailed analysis of the data, however, points to the likelihood of certain differences between the present group of anorexic patients and previous groups. Moreover, it seems that body perception disturbance is not a consistent feature of anorexia nervosa and is only present amongst some patients at certain stages during their illness. On subdividing the anorexic group it was demonstrated that patients who vomit tend to overestimate their size more than do non-vomiters. It also seems likely that normal females are far from homogeneous in terms of body perception. In line with previous findings, a direct relationship was found between marked overestimation of body size and an early relapse. Evidence is also discussed which suggests that body perception disturbance is not specific to anorexia nervosa and may reflect an abnormal sensitivity about body size associated with such factors as the anticipation of an undesired change in weight, extreme concern about slimness and anxiety about putting on weight.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":136},"references":9,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
