Structural network gradient is capable of capturing continuous changes in brain morphology and has the ability to elucidate the underlying processes of neurodevelopment. However, it remains unclear whether structural network gradients are altered in AD and what associations exist between these changes and cognitive function, and gene expression profiles. Methods By constructing an individualized structural network gradient decomposition framework, we calculated the morphological similarity network (MSN) gradients for 404 subjects (186 AD patients and 218 normal controls). We investigated AD-related alterations in MSN gradients, along with the associations between MSN gradients and cognitive function, MSN topological properties, and gene expression profiles. Results Our findings indicated that the principal MSN gradient alterations in AD were primarily characterized by an increase in the primary and secondary sensory cortices and a decrease in the association cortex 1. The primary and higher-order cortices exhibited opposite associations with cognition, including executive function, language skills, and memory processes. Moreover, the principal MSN gradients were found to significantly predict cognitive function in AD. The altered gradient pattern was 14.8% attributable to gene expression profiles, and the genes demonstrating the highest correlation are involved in metabolic activity and synaptic signaling. Conclusions Our results offered novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of structural brain network impairment in AD patients, enhancing our understanding of the neurobiological processes responsible for impaired cognition in patients with AD, and offering a new dimensional structural biomarker for AD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":68,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
