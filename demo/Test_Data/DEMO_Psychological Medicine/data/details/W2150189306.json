This paper aims to provide a framework for the development of further research into the burden of ‘community care’ by offering a clear definition of the burden concept, an exposition of the criteria for evaluating rating scales to measure the concept, a review of major rating scales of burden, and some suggestions for improvements in methodology which are urgently required.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":298},"references":44,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
