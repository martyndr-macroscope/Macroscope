Subjects included 61 gay men (41 HIV −, 20 HIV +) who were assessed at the time of requesting their first HIV test and again 12 months later. The assessments at baseline were conducted double-blind to HIV serostatus. Measures included a neuropsychological battery, neurological examination and full psychiatric assessment. There were no differences between the asymptomatic HIV + and HIV − groups at baseline or at follow-up in terms of mean scores on neuropsychological tests. Mean scores were within the normal range for all neuropsychological tests for both groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict each individual's performance at follow-up on the basis of their baseline performance, psychiatric state, neurological history and drug use for each of the neuropsychological tests. HIV + subjects were more likely than control subjects to perform at a significantly lower level at follow-up on one or more tests than predicted on the basis of their baseline performance.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":8},"references":33,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
