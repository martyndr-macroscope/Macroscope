The 15-item scale is economical to use, avoids the consistent pattern of negatively worded items that plagues the neuroticism (N) Scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) and comprises of items that focus specifically on emotional arousability, thereby bringing the measurement of neuroticism in line with Eysenck&amp;s (1967) original conceptualization. The SEA shows every indication of being psychometrically sound and correlates with related constructs in much the same way as the N Scale of the EPI. The SEA is recommended as an alternative to the EPI for research purposes, particularly where there is a need to measure independently such related constructs as neurosis, self-esteem and private self-consciousness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":40},"references":36,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
