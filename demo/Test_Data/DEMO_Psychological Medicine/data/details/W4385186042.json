Previous case-control studies have investigated group-level differences in structural abnormalities, although the study design cannot account for interindividual differences. Recent research has focused on the association between the heterogeneity of the cerebral cortex morphometric features and clinical heterogeneity. Methods We used neuroimaging data from 420 healthy controls and 695 patients with SCZ from seven studies. Four cerebral cortex measures were obtained: surface area, gray matter volume, thickness, and local gyrification index. We calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) and person-based similarity index (PBSI) scores and performed group comparisons. Associations between the PBSI scores and cognitive functions were evaluated using Spearman's rho test and normative modeling. Results Patients with SCZ had a greater CV of surface area and cortical thickness than those of healthy controls. All PBSI scores across cortical measures were lower in patients with SCZ than in HCs. In the patient group, the PBSI scores for gray matter volume and all cortical measures taken together positively correlated with the full-scale IQ scores. Patients with deviant PBSI scores for gray matter volume and all cortical measures taken together had lower full-scale IQ scores than those of other patients. Conclusions The cerebral cortex in patients with SCZ showed greater regional and global structural variability than that in healthy controls. Patients with deviant similarity of cortical structural profiles exhibited a lower general intelligence than those exhibited by the other patients.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":54,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
