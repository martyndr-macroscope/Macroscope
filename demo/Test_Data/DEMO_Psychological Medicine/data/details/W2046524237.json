Evidence from studies involving healthy volunteers suggests that differences exist between drugs, with imipramine, amitriptyline and mianserin being associated with the most marked detrimental effects. However, these findings have generally not been supported by the few studies using clinical populations, for which improvements in cognitive functions are often recorded following treatment. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed, and the need for further research suggested.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":40},"references":51,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
