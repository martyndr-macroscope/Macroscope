Amylobarbitone was withdrawn, and the patient was maintained on phenobarbitone, with a blood barbiturate level that remained at about 4·0 mg% over several weeks. Themost likelyexplanation of the findings is that the oxidation of amylobarbitone, but not phenobarbitone, is accelerated in patients dependent on the former drug.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":10,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
