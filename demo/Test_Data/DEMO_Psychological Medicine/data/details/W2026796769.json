However, replications of these data have not consistently been reported in either case, which favours the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity. Therefore, we have tried to outline a sampling strategy for linkage replication in affective disorders. We estimated the average number of nuclear families required to replicate X or 11 linkage as a function of the degree of heterogeneity as well as the number to prove heterogeneity given that linkage exists. The results are presented and discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":10},"references":24,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
