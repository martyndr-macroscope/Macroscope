Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine whether self-stigma mitigates the adverse effects of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms on the help-seeking behaviours of Syrian adolescents living in Turkey. Methods The participants of this study included 488 Syrian refugee adolescents (boys, 63.73%; girls, 3627%) living in Turkey. Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and General Help-Seeking Scale and Self-Stigma of Seeking Psychology Help Scale. Results The findings revealed that stress ( β = 0.19, p &lt; 0.01), anxiety ( β = 0.12, p &lt; 0.05), and depression ( β = 0.17, p &lt; 0.01) had significant and positive predictive effects on self-stigma, but not on help-seeking behaviours. Also, self-stigma ( β = −0.12, p &lt; 0.01) had a significant negative predictive effect on help-seeking behaviours. With regard to the indirect effects, the findings showed that self-stigma fully mediated the associations between stress – help-seeking [effect = −0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.11 to −0.01], anxiety – help-seeking (effect = −0.04, 95% CI −0.09 to −0.01)], and depression – help-seeking (effect = −0.05, 95% CI −0.12 to −0.01). Conclusions Our findings highlight the potential negative effects of self-stigma on the help-seeking behaviours of Syrian refugee adolescents, both directly and indirectly. These results can be used to develop and implement effective and efficient interventions to address the unmet mental health needs of refugee adolescents.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":10},"references":61,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
