Additionally, it is unclear whether changes in mental health problems during the pandemic exceed the anticipated increases as children age. This study controls for the linear effect of age in 1399 children, investigating the course of child-reported anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, and inattention symptoms during and after the pandemic, and identifies risk and protective factors that predict these mental health trajectories. Methods Children (51% male; ages 9–11 at the first timepoint) provided mental health ratings at three pandemic timepoints (July–August 2020; March–April 2021; November 2021–January 2022) and one post-pandemic timepoint (January–July 2023). Mothers reported pre-pandemic mental health (2017–2019) and socio-demographic factors. Children reported socio-demographic factors, risk (e.g. screen time, sleep), and resilience (e.g. optimism) factors during the first timepoint. Results Average mental health symptoms increased over time, with more children exceeding clinical cut-offs for poor mental health at each subsequent pandemic timepoint. Growth curve modeling, adjusting for age-related effects, revealed a curvilinear course of mental health symptoms across all domains. Examination of risk and protective factors revealed that pre-existing mental health symptoms and optimism were associated with the course of symptoms. Conclusions After considering age effects, children's mental health follows a curvilinear pattern over time, suggesting an initial decline followed by a rising trend in symptoms post-COVID. These findings underscore the continued need for additional resources and timely, evidence-based mental health prevention and intervention for children.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":10},"references":51,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
