However, its capability to screen for mental disorders in a population-based sample and the impact of adverbial framings (intensity and frequency) on its performance are unknown. Methods The study was based on cross-sectional data from the 1993 Pelotas birth cohort in Brazil. Participants with completed DSM-XC and structured diagnostic interviews ( n = 3578, aged 22, 53.6% females) were included. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+), and negative (LR−) likelihood ratios for each of the 13 DSM-XC domains were estimated for detecting five internalizing disorders (bipolar, generalized anxiety, major depressive, post-traumatic stress, and social anxiety disorders) and three externalizing disorders (antisocial personality, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and alcohol use disorders). Sensitivities and specificities &gt;0.75, LR+ &gt; 2 and LR− &lt; 0.5 were considered meaningful. Values were calculated for the DSM-XC's original scoring and for adverbial framings. Results Several DSM-XC domains demonstrated meaningful screening properties. The anxiety domain exhibited acceptable sensitivity and LR− values for all internalizing disorders. The suicidal ideation, psychosis, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, and dissociation domains displayed acceptable specificity for all disorders. Domains also yielded small but meaningful LR+ values for internalizing disorders. However, LR+ and LR− values were not generally meaningful for externalizing disorders. Frequency-framed questions improved screening properties. Conclusions The DSM-XC domains showed transdiagnostic screening properties, providing small but meaningful changes in the likelihood of internalizing disorders in the community, which can be improved by asking frequency of symptoms compared to intensity. The DSM-XC is currently lacking meaningful domains for externalizing disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":4},"references":50,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
