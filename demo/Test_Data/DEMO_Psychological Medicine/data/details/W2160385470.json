A mathematical model was used in order to identify the characteristics of disturbed patients. The results suggested that behavioural disturbance of a patient in our sample was related to diagnosis, to the ward of admission and to the length of stay in hospital. Patients in all diagnostic categories tended to be more disturbed in the ‘therapeutic community’ than in the ‘medical model’ ward.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":8,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
