Depressives reported more events than schizophrenics, but this excess involved only certain types of events. Depressives reported more exits from the social field, and a variety of undesirable events, particularly those involving interpersonal arguments. They reported no more events in some other classes. These findings support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that qualitative implications of events influence their effects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":135},"references":22,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
