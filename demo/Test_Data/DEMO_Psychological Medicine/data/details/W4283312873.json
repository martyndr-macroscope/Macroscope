Methods In a Swedish cohort ( N = 744 628), associations between spousal DAD and BPN and proband AUD were estimated with Cox proportional hazards; associations between parental AUD, proband premarital AUD, and spousal lifetime DAD and BPN were estimated with logistic regression; and whether spousal DAD or BPN causally increased risk for AUD was evaluated with frailty models. Results Spousal premarital DAD, spousal marital-onset DAD, and spousal BPN (premarital or marital-onset) were associated with proband AUD during marriage [hazard ratios (HR) range 1.44–3.72]. Those with a parental or premarital history of AUD ( v. without) were more likely to marry a spouse with DAD or BPN (odds ratios 1.22–2.77). Moving from an unaffected first spouse to a DAD-affected second spouse increased AUD risk in males (HR 2.90). Moving from an unaffected first spouse to a BPN-affected second spouse increased AUD risk (HR males 3.96; HR females 5.64). Moving to an unaffected second spouse from a DAD-affected first spouse decreased AUD risk, with stronger evidence in females compared to males (HR males 0.59; HR females 0.28). Conclusions Associations between spousal DAD or BPN and proband AUD reflect both selection and causal effects. Marriage to a BPN-affected spouse has a particularly strong effect on AUD risk, with more modest effects for spousal DAD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":4},"references":31,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
