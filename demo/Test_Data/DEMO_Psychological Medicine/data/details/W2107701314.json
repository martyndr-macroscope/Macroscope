The results showed that the deaf had more negative attitudes towards deafness than the hearing. In addition, the deaf believed that hearing people have more negative attitudes to deafness than hearing people actually have. This lack of empathy between the two groups was discussed. The amount of contact with the deaf was found to be associated with more realistic and less stereotyped attitudes to the deaf. The results are discussed in the context of research on social interaction with disabled people.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":21},"references":17,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
