Method Subjects were high-IQ adults with ( n =64) and without ADHD ( n =53). Subjects were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests assessing executive functioning. Results High-IQ adults with ADHD performed less well than those without ADHD on several psychological tests of executive functioning, including the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Stroop Color and Word Test, Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and an auditory continuous performance test (CPT). Test performance in the high-IQ adult ADHD group, however, was average. In the entire sample, performance on several tests of executive functioning including the ROCF and the CVLT were significant predictors of real-world functioning. Conclusions High-IQ adults with ADHD perform less well on tests of executive functioning relative to high-IQ control participants. Performance on several tests of executive functioning was a significant predictor of functioning.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":84},"references":52,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
