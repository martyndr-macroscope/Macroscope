Aerobic exercise is hypothesized to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and thereby synaptic plasticity, leading to increased learning capacity. Systematic CT should take advantage of increased learning capacity and be more effective when combined with aerobic exercise. Methods We examined the impact of a 6-month program of cognitive training &amp; exercise (CT&amp;E) compared to cognitive training alone (CT) in 47 first-episode schizophrenia outpatients. All participants were provided the same Posit Science computerized CT, 4 h/week, using BrainHQ and SocialVille programs. The CT&amp;E group also participated in total body circuit training exercises to enhance aerobic conditioning. Clinic and home-based exercise were combined for a target of 150 min per week. Results The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery Overall Composite improved significantly more with CT&amp;E than with CT alone ( p = 0.04), particularly in the first 3 months (6.5 v. 2.2 T-score points, p &lt; 0.02). Work/school functioning improved substantially more with CT&amp;E than with CT alone by 6 months ( p &lt; 0.001). BDNF gain tended to predict the amount of cognitive gain but did not reach significance. The cognitive gain by 3 months predicted the amount of work/school functioning improvement at 6 months. The amount of exercise completed was strongly associated with the degree of cognitive and work/school functioning improvement. Conclusions Aerobic exercise significantly enhances the impact of CT on cognition and functional outcome in first-episode schizophrenia, apparently driven by the amount of exercise completed.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":47},"references":39,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
