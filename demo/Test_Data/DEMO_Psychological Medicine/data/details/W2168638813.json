However, it is also possible that psychological stress plays a role, inducing a chronic inflammatory process that may predispose to the development of metabolic abnormalities. We investigated the association between childhood maltreatment and inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in subjects with first-episode psychosis and healthy controls. Method Body mass index (BMI), weight and waist circumference were measured in 95 first-episode psychosis patients and 97 healthy controls. Inflammatory and metabolic markers were measured in a subsample of 28 patients and 45 controls. In all the subjects we collected information on childhood maltreatment and recent stressors. Results Patients with childhood maltreatment had higher BMI [25.0 ( s.e .=0.6) kg/m 2 ] and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels [1.1 ( s.e .=0.6) mg/dl] when compared with healthy controls [23.4 ( s.e .=0.4) kg/m 2 , p =0.030 and 0.2 ( s.e .=0.1) mg/dl, p =0.009, respectively]. In contrast, patients without childhood maltreatment were not significantly different from healthy controls for either BMI [24.7 ( s.e .=0.6) kg/m 2 , p =0.07] or CRP levels [0.5 ( s.e .=0.2) mg/dl, p =0.25]. After controlling for the effect of BMI, the difference in CRP levels across the three groups remained significant ( F 2,58 =3.6, p =0.035), suggesting that the increase in inflammation was not driven by an increase in adipose tissue. Conclusions Childhood maltreatment is associated with higher BMI, and increased CRP levels, in patients with a first-episode psychosis. Further studies need to confirm the mechanisms underlying the putative causal relationship between childhood maltreatment and higher BMI, and whether this is indeed mediated by increased inflammation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":113},"references":47,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
