We have previously shown that post-success and post-error cognitive controls are associated with distinct mechanisms particularly related to the prefrontal-cerebellar circuit, raising the possibility that altered dynamic interactions in this circuit may underlie mental illness. Methods This study included 136 patients with three diagnosed disorders [48 schizophrenia (SZ), 49 bipolar disorder (BD), 39 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)] and 89 healthy controls who completed a stop-signal task during fMRI scans. Brain activations for concurrent, post-success, and post-error cognitive controls were analyzed and compared between groups. Dynamic causal modeling was applied to investigate prefrontal-cerebellar effective connectivity patterns during post-success and post-error processing. Results No significant group differences were observed for brain activations and overall effective connectivity structures during post-success and post-error conditions. However, significant group differences were shown for the modulational effect on top-down connectivity from the prefrontal cortex to the cerebellum during post-error trials ( p FWE = 0.02), which was driven by reduced modulations in both SZ and ADHD. During post-success trials, there were significantly decreased modulational effect on bottom-up connectivity from the cerebellum to the prefrontal cortex in ADHD ( p FWE = 0.04) and decreased driving input to the cerebellum in SZ ( p FWE = 0.04). Conclusions These findings suggest that patients with SZ and ADHD are associated with insufficient neural modulation on the prefrontal-cerebellar circuit during post-success and post-error cognitive processing, a phenomenon that may underlie cognitive deficits in these disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":14},"references":45,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
