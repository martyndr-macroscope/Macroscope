There were no significant differences between either the violent or non-violent attempters and those without a history of attempted suicide in the mean lumbar CSF concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA, the dopamine metabolite HVA, or the norepinephrine metabolite MHPG. Significantly more of the suicide attempters had a previous major depressive episode, had received a course of ECT, and had significantly more psychiatric admissions than those who had never attempted suicide.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":64},"references":25,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
