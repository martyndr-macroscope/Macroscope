A tendency towards higher antibody levels is found in patients whose retardation is of unknown aetiology. The relationship of these observations to previous research findings and the possible significance of herpes simplex virus in the aetiology of mental retardation are discussed","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":9,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
