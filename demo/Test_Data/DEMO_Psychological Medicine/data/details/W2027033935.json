It also stimulated research into the fundamental biochemical errors underlying depressive illness. In view of this historical incident it is surprising that other drugs used in the treatment of hypertension, especially those producing their therapeutic effects by a similar mechanism to reserpine, have not been more critically evaluated. This field of research calls for valid self-rating instruments in order to survey a large population. Using this method, it was found that there was no evidence of a relation between the administration of methyldopa or other drugs and depressive illness. These findings are an indication that adverse psychiatric effects of drugs for hypertension, and methyldopa in particular, may be less common than is sometimes supposed. It is concluded that the matter should be clarified by a careful prospective study.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":30},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
