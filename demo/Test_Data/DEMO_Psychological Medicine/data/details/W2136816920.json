These circumstances can be seen largely to derive from the long-term psychiatric and social difficulties of patients described in Part I. A constellation of factors is identified which often limits any alternative to a compulsory admission. A number of recommendations are made based on these findings which are designed to diminish the need for compulsion in the future.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":32},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
