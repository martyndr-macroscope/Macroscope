In situations of chronic stress vasopressin plays an important role in regulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of anterior pituitary vasopressin V 3 receptors in maintaining the hypercortisolism seen in melancholic depression. Method. Fourteen patients with major depression and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy comparison subjects were recruited. Desmopressin (ddAVP) 10 μg was given intravenously and ACTH and cortisol release was monitored for 120 min. Results. The mean± S . E . M . ACTH response in the depressives was 28·4±4·3 ng/l and in the healthy subjects was 18·8±4·9 ng/l ( P =0·04). The mean± S . E . M . cortisol response in the depressives was 261·8±46·5 nmol/l and in the healthy subjects was 107·3±26·1 nmol/l ( P &lt;0·01). Conclusions. Patients with major depression have augmented ACTH and cortisol responses to desmopressin indicating enhanced V 3 responsivity.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":53},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
