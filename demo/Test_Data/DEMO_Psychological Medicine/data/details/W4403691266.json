Methods Seventy five patients participated in this trial consisting of 20 sessions over 5 consecutive days comparing dual-site (cTBS of right lOFC followed sequentially by 20 Hz rTMS of left dlPFC), active control (sham right lOFC followed by 20 Hz rTMS of left dlPFC) and sham control (sham for both targets). Resting-state fMRI was acquired prior to and following treatment. Results Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) scores were similarly significantly improved at 4 weeks in both the Dual and Single group relative to Sham. Planned comparisons immediately after treatment highlighted greater HRSD-24 clinical responders (Dual: 47.8% v. Single:18.2% v. Sham:4.3%, χ 2 = 13.0, p = 0.002) and in PHQ-9 scores by day 5 in the Dual relative to Sham group. We further showed that accelerated 20 Hz stimulation targeting the left dlPFC (active control) is significantly better than sham at 4 weeks. Dual stimulation decreased lOFC-subcallosal cingulate functional connectivity. Greater baseline lOFC-thalamic connectivity predicted better therapeutic response, while decreased lOFC-thalamic connectivity correlated with better response. Conclusions Our novel accelerated dual TMS protocol shows rapid clinically relevant antidepressant efficacy which may be related to state-modulation. This study has implications for community-based accessible TMS without neuronavigation and rapid onset targeting suicidal ideation and accelerated discharge from hospital.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":86,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
