Using the richly detailed casebooks of Ticehurst House Asylum, it was possible to study over 600 admissions and assess them using the Research Diagnostic Criteria. Over 80% of cases conformed to recognizable psychiatric illness, mainly schizophrenia and manicdepressive psychosis. Movement disorder, often equivalent to tardive dyskinesia, was noted in nearly one-third of schizophrenics. Violence, masturbation and severe psychopathology were also common features. The implications of these findings in terms of treatment, diagnosis and the rise of the asylum are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":39},"references":48,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
