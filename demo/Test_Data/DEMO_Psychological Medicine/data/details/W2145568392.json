During the study they all received training from their clinical firms. In addition, 36 of the students received 1 of 3 types of feedback training. This was given by tutors who used television replays, audiotape replays or ratings of practice interviews conducted by the students. As in previous studies there was little improvement in the interviewing skills of those students who only received training from their clinical firms. In contrast, all 3 feedback groups improved their ability to elicit accurate and relevant information. However, only the television and audiotape groups also showed gains in techniques. While the differences between these 2 groups were not significant, they all favoured the television group.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":179},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
