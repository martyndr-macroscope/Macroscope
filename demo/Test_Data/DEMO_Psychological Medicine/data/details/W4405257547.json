There is growing awareness that neuropathological processes associated with a disease fail to map to a specific brain region but do map to a specific brain network. We sought to investigate brain structural damage networks across different stages of schizophrenia. Methods We initially identified gray matter alterations in 523 cHR, 855 gHR, 2162 FES, and 2640 ChS individuals relative to 6963 healthy controls. By applying novel functional connectivity network mapping to large-scale discovery and validation resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets, we mapped these affected brain locations to four specific networks. Results Brain structural damage networks of cHR and gHR had limited and non-overlapping spatial distributions, with the former mainly involving the frontoparietal network and the latter principally implicating the subcortical network, indicative of distinct neuropathological mechanisms underlying cHR and gHR. By contrast, brain structural damage networks of FES and ChS manifested as similar patterns of widespread brain areas predominantly involving the somatomotor, ventral attention, and subcortical networks, suggesting an emergence of more prominent brain structural abnormalities with illness onset that have trait-like stability over time. Conclusions Our findings may not only provide a refined picture of schizophrenia neuropathology from a network perspective, but also potentially contribute to more targeted and effective intervention strategies for individuals at different schizophrenia stages.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":17},"references":116,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
