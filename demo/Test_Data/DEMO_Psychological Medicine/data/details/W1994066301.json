Using stringent criteria to establish the presence of psychiatric morbidity, 225 cases were found, indicating an overall frequency of 13·9 %. The great majority of cases were suffering from neurotic illnesses and for most the presenting complaint was of a physical symptom, such as headache, abdominal pain, cough or weakness. The health workers following their normal procedure correctly detected one third of the psychiatric cases.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":21,"cited_by_count":1017},"references":30,"networkCitations":21,"seed":false}
