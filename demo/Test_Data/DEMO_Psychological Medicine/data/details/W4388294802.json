This study, therefore, explores the cognitive discrepancy, and its association with the trajectory of symptoms and functioning over a 6-month period. Methods We used data from the Prospective Research Observation to Assess Cognition in Treated patients with MDD (PROACT) study, from which 598 patients were included. Cognitive discrepancy scores were computed using a novel methodology, with positive values indicating more subjective than objective deficit (i.e. ‘underestimation’) and negative values indicating more objective than subjective difficulties (i.e. ‘overestimation’). Linear growth curve models were employed to examine the association of the cognitive discrepancy with the trajectory of depressive symptoms, psychosocial function, and quality of life. Results About 68% of patients displayed disproportionately more objective than subjective cognitive deficit at baseline, and the mean cognitive discrepancy score was −1.4 (2.7). Overestimation was associated with a faster decrease of HDRS-17 ( β = −0.46, p = 0.002) and a faster decrease of psychosocial function in social life ( β = −0.13, p = 0.013) and family life ( β = −0.12, p = 0.026), and a greater improvement of EQ-5D utility score ( β = 0.01, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion We found a lower sensitivity of cognitive deficit at baseline and its decrease was associated with better health outcomes. Our findings have clinical implications of the necessity to assess both subjective and objective cognition for identification and categorization and to incorporate cognitive and psychological therapies for optimized treatment outcomes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":35,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
