This pattern may be partially attributable to the unfavorable socio-environmental conditions that surround ethnic minority groups. Perceived ethnic discrimination (PED) in particular has been a salient putative risk factor to explain the increased risk. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of PED on reporting PS/PEs in ethnic minorities. This review abides by the guidelines set forth by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The included studies were obtained from the databases: Medline, PsycINFO, and Web Of Science. Sub-group analyses were performed assessing the effect of PED in different subtypes of PS, the influence of ethnicity and moderating/mediating factors. Results Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria, and nine were used to conduct the meta-analysis. We found a positive association between PED and the occurrence of PS/PEs among ethnic minorities. The combined odds ratio were 1.77 (95% CI 1.26–2.49) for PS and 1.94 (95% CI 1.42–2.67) for PEs. We found that the association was similar across ethnic groups and did not depend on the ethnic origin of individuals. Weak evidence supported the buffering effects of ethnic identity, collective self-esteem and social support; and no evidence supported the moderating effect of ethnic density. Sensitivity to race-based rejection significantly but only slightly mediated the association. Conclusion These findings suggest that PED is involved in the increased risk of PS/PEs in ethnic minority populations.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":74},"references":111,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
