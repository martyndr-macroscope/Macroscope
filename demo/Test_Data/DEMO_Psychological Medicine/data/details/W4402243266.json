However, the degree to which individual patients follow this course is unknown. We characterized trajectories of neuropsychiatric symptoms over 12 months post-TBI. We hypothesized that a substantial proportion of individuals would display trajectories distinct from the group-average course, with some exhibiting less favorable courses. Methods Participants were level 1 trauma center patients with TBI ( n = 1943), orthopedic trauma controls ( n = 257), and non-injured friend controls ( n = 300). Trajectories of six symptom dimensions (Depression, Anxiety, Fear, Sleep, Physical, and Pain) were identified using growth mixture modeling from 2 weeks to 12 months post-injury. Results Depression, Anxiety, Fear, and Physical symptoms displayed three trajectories: Stable-Low (86.2–88.6%), Worsening (5.6–10.9%), and Improving (2.6–6.4%). Among symptomatic trajectories (Worsening, Improving), lower-severity TBI was associated with higher prevalence of elevated symptoms at 2 weeks that steadily resolved over 12 months compared to all other groups, whereas higher-severity TBI was associated with higher prevalence of symptoms that gradually worsened from 3–12 months. Sleep and Pain displayed more variable recovery courses, and the most common trajectory entailed an average level of problems that remained stable over time (Stable-Average; 46.7–82.6%). Symptomatic Sleep and Pain trajectories (Stable-Average, Improving) were more common in traumatically injured groups. Conclusions Findings illustrate the nature and rates of distinct neuropsychiatric symptom trajectories and their relationship to traumatic injuries. Providers may use these results as a referent for gauging typical v. atypical recovery in the first 12 months post-injury.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":38,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
