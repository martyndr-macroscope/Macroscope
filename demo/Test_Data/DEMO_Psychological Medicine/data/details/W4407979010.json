However, inconsistent findings on RSN disruptions, with variations in reported connectivity within and between RSNs, complicate the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression. Methods A systematic literature search of PubMed and Web of Science identified studies that employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore RSN changes in depression. Studies using seed-based functional connectivity analysis or independent component analysis were included, and coordinate-based meta-analyses were performed to evaluate alterations in RSN connectivity both within and between networks. Results A total of 58 studies were included, comprising 2321 patients with depression and 2197 healthy controls. The meta-analysis revealed significant alterations in RSN connectivity, both within and between networks, in patients with depression compared with healthy controls. Specifically, within-network changes included both increased and decreased connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) and increased connectivity in the frontoparietal network (FPN). Between-network findings showed increased DMN–FPN and limbic network (LN)–DMN connectivity, decreased DMN–somatomotor network and LN–FPN connectivity, and varied ventral attention network (VAN)–dorsal attentional network (DAN) connectivity. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between illness duration and increased connectivity between the VAN and DAN. Conclusions These findings not only provide a comprehensive characterization of RSN disruptions in depression but also enhance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":12},"references":68,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
