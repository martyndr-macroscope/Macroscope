Kline (1981) regarded this study as providing “irrefutable evidence for the Freudian concept of repression”. On the other hand, results from Kleinsmith &amp; Kaplan (1964) suggested that this effect may reverse after a delay. The present study attempted to replicate Levinger &amp; Clark's result using stimulus words balanced for concreteness and frequency. In addition, recall was tested immediately and after a delay. Associations to emotional material were more poorly recalled immediately than associations to material which was low in emotional valence, but tended to be better recalled a month later. There were no differences in recall of pleasant versus unpleasant material. Results do not support the repression hypothesis, in that emotional material becomes more memorable over time. Moreover, repression should differentially apply to unpleasant rather than pleasant material but no such differences were found.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":22},"references":14,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
