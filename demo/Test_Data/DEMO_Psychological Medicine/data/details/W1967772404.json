They were also divided into two groups (‘early’ and ‘late’ onset), according to whether their first-ever attack of depressive illness had occurred before the age of 45. After they had recovered from their illness, aspects of personality were assessed on a battery of self-rating personality tests. There was no evidence from this study that any of the personality traits measured was in any way significantly related to any of the clinical features of the illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":20},"references":15,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
