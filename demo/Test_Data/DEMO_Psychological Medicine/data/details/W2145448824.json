Residents of 24 nursing homes were surveyed using the Canberra Interview for the Elderly (CIE) and a range of environmental measures was also taken. Of 323 residents who were screened for cognitive impairment, 165 (51%) scored 18 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al. 1975), and were interviewed with the CIE. According to DSM-III-R criteria and the CIE, the prevalence of major depressive episode was 9·7%. Using ICD-10 criteria, 6·1% of residents suffered from a severe depressive episode, 6·7% from a moderate depressive episode and 6·7% from a mild depressive episode. Some measures of the social environment were significantly related to depressive symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":68},"references":37,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
