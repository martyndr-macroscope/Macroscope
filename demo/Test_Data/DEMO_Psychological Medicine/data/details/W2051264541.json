In particular there is a sharp drop in overestimation between ages 10 and 11 and thereafter a more gradual and non-significant decline. These age-specific normative data are useful in assessing body image distortions in a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":90},"references":5,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
