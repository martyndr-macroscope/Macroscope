Identifying modifiable risk factors prior to the onset of cannabis use could help inform preventative interventions. Method Analysis nested within a UK prospective birth cohort study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Participants ( n = 6,049) provided data on cannabis use and symptoms of cannabis problems using the Cannabis Abuse Screening Test at two or more time points between the ages of 15–24 years. Risk factors included internalizing and externalizing disorders assessed at age 10 years, and cognitive function assessed at age 8 years via short-term memory, emotion recognition, divided attention, and listening comprehension. Results Participants were mostly female (59.1%) and white (95.73%). Five patterns of adolescent cannabis use problems were identified using longitudinal latent class analysis: stable-no problems ( n = 5,157, 85%), early-onset high ( n = 104, 2%), late-onset high ( n = 153, 3%), early onset low ( n = 348, 6%), and late-onset low ( n = 287, 5%). In adjusted models, externalizing disorders were associated with early-onset high [RR, 95% CI: 2.82 (1.72, 4.63)], late-onset high [RR, 95% CI: 1.62 (1.02, 2.57)], and early-onset low [RR, 95% CI: 1.82 (1.30, 2.55)] compared to the stable-no problems class. Internalizing disorders were associated with late-onset low only [RR, 95% CI: .50 (.26, .96)], and short-term memory with late-onset high only [RR, 95% CI: 1.09 (1.01, 1.18) compared to the stable-no problems class. Conclusions Childhood externalizing disorders were consistently associated with increased risk of problematic patterns of cannabis use over adolescence, particularly early-onset and high levels of problems.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":41,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
