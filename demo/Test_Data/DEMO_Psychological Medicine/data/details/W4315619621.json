Depression remission is often associated with weight gain, a major risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MetS). The primary objective of our study was to assess prospectively the impact of response to antidepressant treatment on developing MetS in a sample of MDD patients with a current major depressive episode (MDE) and who are newly initiating their treatment. Methods In the 6-month prospective METADAP cohort, non-overweight patients, body mass index &lt;25 kg/m 2 , with MDD and a current MDE were assessed for treatment response after 3 months of treatment, and incidence of MetS after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Outcome variables were MetS, number of MetS criteria, and each MetS criterion (high waist circumference, high blood pressure, high triglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterolemia, and high fasting plasma glucose). Results In total, 98/169 patients (58%) responded to treatment after 3 months. A total of 2.7% (1/38) developed MetS out of which 12.7% (10/79) ( p value &lt; 0.001) had responded to treatment after 3 months. The fixed-effect regression models showed that those who responded to treatment after 3 months of follow-up had an 8.6 times higher odds of developing MetS (odds ratio = 8.58, 95% confidence interval 3.89–18.93, p value &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Compared to non-responders, non-overweight patients who responded to treatment after 3 months of antidepressant treatment had a significantly higher risk of developing MetS during the 6 months of treatment. Psychiatrists and nurses should closely monitor the metabolic profile of their patients, especially those who respond to treatment.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
