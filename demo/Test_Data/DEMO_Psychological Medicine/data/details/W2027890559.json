The mesolimbic and nigrostriatal portions of the dopaminergic system are probably the main targets of these drugs for the mental and the extrapyramidal actions respectively. Dopaminergic hyperfunction, induced by amphetamines or dopa, may lead to a disturbance mimicking paranoid schizophrenia, lending further support for a key role of dopamine in mental functions. While a primary disturbance in dopamine function in schizophrenia cannot be ruled out, the intimate relationship between dopaminergic and other neuronal systems must be emphasized. The possible involvement of other amine, aminoacid or peptide transmitters in schizophrenia cannot be disregarded.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":161},"references":108,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
