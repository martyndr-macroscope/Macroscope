Factor analysis yielded five subscales which were compared with those reported elsewhere. Other properties of the instrument were investigated. It was concluded that the instrument was potentially valuable to those investigating coping in families with special problems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":45},"references":43,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
