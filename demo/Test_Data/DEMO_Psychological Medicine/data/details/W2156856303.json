The patients were found to have enlarged external cerebrospinal fluid spaces compared to controls. No differences were found in ventricular size and X-ray absorption density measurements between patients and controls. The patients performed abnormally on the symbol digit test, the scores of which displayed a significant negative correlation with the CT scan changes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":91},"references":34,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
