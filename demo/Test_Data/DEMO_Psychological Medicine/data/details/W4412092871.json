However, little is known about the potential microbiota–gut–brain axis mechanisms by which Alistipes exerts its pathogenic effects in MDD. Methods We collected data from 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging from 111 MDD patients and 102 healthy controls. We used multistage linked analyses, including group comparisons, correlation analyses, and mediation analyses, to explore the relationships between the gut microbiome ( Alistipes ), fecal metabolome, brain imaging, and behaviors in MDD. Results Gut microbiome analysis demonstrated that MDD patients had a higher abundance of Alistipes relative to controls. Partial least squares regression revealed that the increased Alistipes was significantly associated with fecal metabolome in MDD, involving a range of metabolites mainly enriched for amino acid, vitamin B, and bile acid metabolism pathways. Correlation analyses showed that the Alistipes -related metabolites were associated with a wide array of brain imaging measures involving gray matter morphology, spontaneous brain function, and white matter integrity, among which the brain functional measures were, in turn, associated with affective symptoms (anxiety and anhedonia) and cognition (sustained attention) in MDD. Of more importance, further mediation analyses identified multiple significant mediation pathways where the brain functional measures in the visual cortex mediated the associations of metabolites with behavioral deficits. Conclusion Our findings provide a proof of concept that Alistipes and its related metabolites play a critical role in the pathophysiology of MDD through the microbiota–gut–brain axis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":106,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
