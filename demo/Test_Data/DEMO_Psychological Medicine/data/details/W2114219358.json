The present study examined whether variation at the rs1360780 SNP of FKBP5 gene moderated the association between childhood abuse and psychotic experiences. The discovery sample included 437 individuals and the replication sample included 305, all drawn from the general population. In both samples, a significant gene-environment interaction effect was detected indicating that T allele homozygotes of the FKBP5 gene scored significantly higher on positive PEs after exposure to childhood abuse compared to CC carriers.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":18},"references":16,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
