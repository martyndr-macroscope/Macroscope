However, it is not well-understood if and what abnormalities are present in individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. Methods This experimental study employed facial electromyography (left zygomaticus major and left corrugator supercilia) in a sample of CHR individuals ( N = 34) and healthy controls ( N = 32) to detect alterations in facial expressions in response to emotionally evocative film clips and to determine links with symptoms. Results Findings revealed that the CHR group showed facial blunting manifested in reduced zygomatic activity in response to an excitement (but not amusement, fear, or sadness) film clip compared to controls. Reductions in zygomatic activity in the CHR group emerged in response to the emotionally evocative peak period of the excitement film clip. Lower zygomaticus activity during the excitement clip was related to anxiety while lower rates of change in zygomatic activity during the excitement video clip were related to higher psychosis risk conversion scores. Conclusions Together, these findings inform vulnerability/disease driving mechanisms and biomarker and treatment development.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":7},"references":68,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
