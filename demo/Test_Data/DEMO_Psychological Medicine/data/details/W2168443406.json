They usually result in an increase in the number of referrals to the mental health facilities, which reflects a cumulative need for psychiatric examination and treatment in the population. A significant decrease in the annual first referral rates per 1000 inhabitants aged 15 years and above is apparent in an analysis of the trends in the Danish Samsø community psychiatric service from its inception in 1957 until 1982. The average annual rates were 19·4 in the first 5-year period, 10·0 in the second 5-year period, and 8·4 in the ‘steady state period’ from 1967 to 1982. The conclusion is, therefore, that the work load connected with the cumulative need for psychiatric examination and treatment should be terminated in approximately 10 years. A comparison of the two 5-year periods, 1957–61 and 1978–82, demonstrated a decrease in first referral rates in almost all diagnostic groups: this is significant among manic-depressive psychoses, neurotic states and unspecified mental disorders. The rates of no mental disorders and senile and arteriosclerotic psychoses were almost unchanged. In the 10-year age groups there was a decrease in first referral rates for all groups, except for the groups aged 75 years and above whose rates were unchanged. The concept of cumulative need for psychiatric examination and treatment is discussed in relation to the reports of various district psychiatric service programmes in different European countries.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":13},"references":14,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
