The presentation of savant abilities is typical of that previously described. Similarities between autism, the disorder most characteristically associated with savants, and GTS in terms of obsessionality are noted. Previously reported psychological studies of autistic savants are briefly reviewed and, together with evidence from neuroimaging in GTS, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and autism, used to support a model of the underpinnings of savant skills.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":23},"references":13,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
