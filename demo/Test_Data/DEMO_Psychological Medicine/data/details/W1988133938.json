The present study investigates the effects of loading doses of the cate-cholamine precursor L-tyrosine in this illness. Groups of schizophrenic and control subjects were given loading doses of L-tyrosine after which plasma tyrosine levels and excretion of some tyrosine metabolities were measured. In only one parameter, excretion of free p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, was any significant difference observed between the groups. The study is discussed in relation to some of the biochemical theories advanced from time to time for schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":16,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
