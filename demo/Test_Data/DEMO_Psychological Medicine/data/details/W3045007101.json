Nevertheless, most previous studies lack a control group or have small study samples or short follow-up periods. Method We aimed to address these limitations by studying a large epidemiological cohort of patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders and a comparable control sample for a 10-year period. Results Our results support the generalized stability of cognitive functions in schizophrenia spectrum disorders considering the entire group. However, the existence of a subgroup of patients characterized by deteriorating cognition and worse long-term clinical outcomes must be noted. Nevertheless, it was not possible to identify concomitant factors or predictors of deterioration (all P s &gt; 0.05). Conclusions Cognitive functions in schizophrenia spectrum disorder are stable; however, a subgroup of subjects that deteriorate can be characterized.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":16},"references":48,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
