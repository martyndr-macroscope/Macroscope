Discharge summaries from 357 patients with a psychotic illness were examined to investigate factors associated with insight. A highly significant association was found between British white ethnic origin and being thought by the admitting psychiatrist to have some insight. Possible explanations include: different ways of understanding mental illness in different cultures, greater stigma leading to greater denial of illness in some cultures, greater illness severity at admission in some ethnic groups and racial bias in psychiatrists' ratings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":21},"references":7,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
