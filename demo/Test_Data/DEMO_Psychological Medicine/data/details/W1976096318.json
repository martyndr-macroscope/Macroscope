Cross-sectional data are presented on 2767 interviews. The psychometric properties of the GHQ justified the use of a total score. Although females had a higher risk of psychiatric morbidity, the strongest association was between unemployment and GHQ. The association between unemployment and GHQ scores was shown to be present after controlling for sex, ethnic group and educational qualification differences. Longitudinal analyses showed that the experience of unemployment was more likely to create increased symptoms, rather than the reverse.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":316},"references":26,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
