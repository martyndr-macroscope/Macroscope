It is unclear what clinical and cognitive phenotypic characteristics present during remission predict future recurrence. Methods: Participants (135 with remitted LLD and 69 comparison subjects across three institutions) completed baseline phenotyping, including psychiatric, medical, and social history, psychiatric symptom and personality trait assessment, and neuropsychological testing. Participants were clinically assessed every two months for two years while receiving standard antidepressant treatment. Analyses examined group differences in phenotypic measure using general linear models. Concurrent associations between phenotypic measures and diagnostic groups were examined using LASSO logistic regression. Results: Sixty (44%) LLD participants experienced a relapse over the two-year period. Numerous phenotypic measures across all domains differed between remitted LLD and comparison participants. Only residual depressive symptom severity, rumination, medical comorbidity, and executive dysfunction significantly predicted LLD classification. Fewer measures differed between relapsing and sustained remission LLD subgroups, with the relapsing group exhibiting greater antidepressant treatment intensity, greater fatigue, rumination, and disability, higher systolic blood pressure, greater life stress and lower instrumental social support. Relapsing group classification was informed by antidepressant treatment intensity, lower instrumental social support, and greater life stress. Conclusions: A wide range of phenotypic factors differed between remitted LLD and comparison groups. Fewer measures differed between relapsing and sustained remission LLD subgroups, with less social support and greater stress informing vulnerability to subsequent relapse. This research suggests potential targets for relapse prevention and emphasizes the need for clinically translatable relapse biomarkers to inform care.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":3},"references":65,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
