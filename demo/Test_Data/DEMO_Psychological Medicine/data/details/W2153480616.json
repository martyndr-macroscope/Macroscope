The analysis supports the general decline reported in an earlier shorter-term study except for the over 65s, where the trend was reversed. The implications of the findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":9},"references":5,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
