Sixteen per cent of the suicides and 11% of the controls had a criminal record, a statistically insignificant difference. In addition, no significant differences were found in the proportion of recidivists and of violent offenders, or in the number of their offences and convictions. A significant difference was found regarding the distribution of the offences by particular laws: more than a half of the offences committed by criminal suicides concerned violations of the road traffic laws, this being in agreement with the hypothesis that risky, accident-prone behaviour is a suicidal behaviour equivalent.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":60,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
