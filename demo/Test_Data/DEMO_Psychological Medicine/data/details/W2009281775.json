Systematic comparisons of the groups were made, and significant discrepancies validated using a second cohort of patients. A number of social, demographic and clinical differences were found, as well as some unexpected similarities. The rates for subsequent (completed) suicide were conspicuously different in the six age-sex subgroups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":79},"references":9,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
