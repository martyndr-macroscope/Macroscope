According to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis, treatment resistance may be linked to pronounced developmental impairments. We examined school grades and attendance trajectories in children who later developed TRS. Methods This case-control study analyzed school grade point average and attendance among all individuals born after 1990 and started on clozapine in Chile’s public health system as a proxy for TRS. Control groups included children later diagnosed with treatment-responsive schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unaffected classmates. Linear mixed models accounted for individual and school-level confounders. Results We included 1072 children (9929 observations, 29.3% female) subsequently diagnosed with TRS, 323 (2802 observations, 25.7% female) with schizophrenia, 175 (1784 observations, 53.8% female) bipolar disorder, and 273,260 (533,335 observations, 47% female) unaffected classmates. Children who later developed TRS had worse grades across levels than their classmates (−0.26 SD [−0.2, −0.4]), but not treatment-responsive schizophrenia. All severe mental illness groups showed grade declines in later school levels, with TRS showing steeper linear decline than treatment-responsive schizophrenia ( group × age of −0.03; 95%CI −0.04, −0.01) and steeper quadratic decline than bipolar disorder ( group×age 2 of −0.005; −0.01, −0.001). Attendance declined over time in the two groups developing schizophrenia compared to their classmates. Those developing TRS experienced the sharpest drop ( group×age compared to schizophrenia −0.03; −0.05, −0.01 and bipolar disorder −0.027; −0.049, −0.006). Conclusions TRS may stem from a more aggressive pathological process or pronounced late-maturation abnormality, rather than an early premorbid impairment, suggesting an intervention target.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":30,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
