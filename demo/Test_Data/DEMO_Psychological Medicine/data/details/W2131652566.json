An analysis of the timing of referral and the total number in care at various stages of the study period confirmed an increased rate of psychosis following childbirth. Rates for other diagnoses showed no such clear relationship. Obstetric and social factors were not related to postpartum morbidity. These results are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":42},"references":10,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
