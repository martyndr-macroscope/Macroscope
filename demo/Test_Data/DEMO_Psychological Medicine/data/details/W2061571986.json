It is concluded that, while there is an increasingly urgent need for the development and application of psychogeriatric screening methods as a step towards preventive action, such methods are still at an early experimental stage. Prescriptive screening programmes are contra-indicated at present. The most immediate requirement is for evaluative research, which should be planned to take account both of the properties of the screening instruments and of the health-care and social settings in which these are to be applied. No major progress in this field can be expected unless it proves possible to integrate methods of early case-detection, and of systematic surveillance of the at-risk elderly, into the work of primary medical and social services.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":70},"references":105,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
