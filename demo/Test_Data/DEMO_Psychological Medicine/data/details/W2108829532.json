The concordance between the computer diagnosis AGECAT and psychiatrists' diagnosis is at least as good in these replication samples as in the original studies (Copeland et al. 1986). AGECAT has been shown to be useful for epidemiological surveys and as a diagnostic guide for non-medical interviewers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":134},"references":13,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
