It is a demanding and effortful process prone to failure. Deficits are particularly prevalent in mood disorders. However, conventional methods of assessment, rooted in overall measures of performance, neglect the nuanced temporal dimensions inherent in sustained attention, necessitating alternative analytical approaches. Methods This study investigated sustained attention deficits and temporal patterns of attentional fluctuation in a large clinical cohort of patients with bipolar depression (BPd, n = 33), bipolar euthymia (BPe, n = 84), major depression (MDd, n = 38) and controls (HC, n = 138) using a continuous performance task (CPT). Longitudinal and spectral analyses were employed to examine trial-level reaction time (RT) data. Results Longitudinal analysis revealed a significant worsening of performance over time (vigilance decrement) in BPd, whilst spectral analysis unveiled attentional fluctuations concentrated in the frequency range of 0.077 Hz (1/12.90 s)–0.049 Hz (1/20.24 s), with BPd and MDd demonstrating greater spectral power compared to BPe and controls. Conclusions Although speculative, the increased variability in this frequency range may have an association with the dysfunctional activity of the Default Mode Network, which has been shown to oscillate at a similar timescale. These findings underscore the importance of considering the temporal dimensions of sustained attention and show the potential of spectral analysis of RT in future clinical research.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":68,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
