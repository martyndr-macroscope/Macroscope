Our aim was to test the possible association between inflammatory and neurotrophic molecular markers and the development of post-stroke depression. Method We studied 134 patients with a first episode of ischemic stroke without previous history of depression or speech disorders. We screened for the existence of major depression symptoms in accordance with DSM-IV criteria and a Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score &gt;11 at discharge and 1 month after stroke. At these times, serum levels of molecular markers of inflammation [interleukin (IL)−1β, IL-6, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, leptin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] and neurotrophic factors [brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)] were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results Twenty-five patients (18.7%) were diagnosed as having major depression at discharge. Out of 104 patients who completed the follow-up period, 23 were depressed at 1 month (22.1%). Patients with major depression showed higher serum leptin levels at discharge [43.4 (23.4–60.2) v . 6.4 (3.7–16.8) ng/ml, p &lt;0.001] and at 1 month after stroke [46.2 (34.0–117.7) v . 6.4 (3.4–12.2) ng/ml, p &lt;0.001). Serum levels of leptin &gt;20.7 ng/ml were independently associated with post-stroke depression [odds ratio (OR) 16.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2–51.5, p &lt;0.0001]. Leptin levels were even higher in the eight patients who developed depression after discharge [114.6 (87.6–120.2) v . 7.2 (3.6–13.6) ng/ml, p &lt;0.0001]. Conclusions Serum leptin levels at discharge are found to be associated with post-stroke depression and may predict its development during the next month.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":87},"references":71,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
