Three health indicators were examined: (1) annoyance reactions measured with a scale which did not include symptoms; (2) a symptom score, obtained with a screening instrument which identifies possible psychiatric cases; and (3) confirmed psychiatric cases identified with a traditional diagnosis after an interview by a psychiatrist. Noise was undoubtedly associated with annoyance. An association between noise and psychiatric measures was only present in a subgroup of respondents of high education. There was a marked association between annoyance and psychiatric measures. An attempt was made to clarify the nature of this relationship. Hypersensitivity to noise was associated with a high frequency of psychiatric symptoms and should be considered among the high risk factors for psychiatric illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":81},"references":32,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
