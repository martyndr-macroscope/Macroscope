Prevalence of current or past alcohol abuse was 24% for males, 5.9% for females or 16.7% overall. When alcohol abuse occurred in HD probands it was often concurrent with depressive symptoms, and may have been associated with the threat of the disease. There was no evidence that HD patients had an increased rate of alcohol abuse above that of the local Baltimore community.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":19},"references":23,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
