Previous literatures with limited sample size utilizing group-level structural covariance networks (SCN) commonly generated mixed findings regarding the topology of brain networks. Methods We analyzed T1 images from a high-powered multisite sample including 1173 patients with MDD and 1019 healthy controls (HCs). We used regional gray matter volume to construct individual SCN by utilizing a novel approach based on the interregional effect size difference. We further investigated MDD-related structural connectivity alterations using topological metrics. Results Compared to HCs, the MDD patients showed a shift toward randomization characterized by increased integration. Further subgroup analysis of patients in different stages revealed this randomization pattern was also observed in patients with recurrent MDD, while the first-episode drug naïve patients exhibited decreased segregation. Altered nodal properties in several brain regions which have a key role in both emotion regulation and executive control were also found in MDD patients compared with HCs. The abnormalities in inferior temporal gyrus were not influenced by any specific site. Moreover, antidepressants increased nodal efficiency in the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions The MDD patients at different stages exhibit distinct patterns of randomization in their brain networks, with increased integration during illness progression. These findings provide valuable insights into the disruption in structural brain networks that occurs in patients with MDD and might be useful to guide future therapeutic interventions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":10},"references":71,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
