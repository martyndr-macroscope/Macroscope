Based primarily on PSE findings together with previously published diagnostic criteria, we identified 11 clear or index cases of schizophrenia, 12 of affective psychoses, and 12 of neurotic/personality disorders. All patients were given daily 2 analogue scales, one measuring mood and the other alertness. Among the index cases, the depressives were distinguished by low scores on both scales and the manics by high scores. There was little overlap in the distribution of the scores among the diagnostic groups, suggesting that these scales might be effective psychological markers of clear affective versus clear non-affective functional disorders. Among the undiagnosed cases, those with low or high scores on both scales resembled index affectives phenomenologically, clinically, and demographically. The scores of the ‘affective-like’ patients overlapped little with those of the ‘non-affective-like’ patients. The scales therefore might be practical diagnostic aids.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":17},"references":13,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
