Yet, little is known about racial/ethnic differences in precursors to suicide, including suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA). Methods Data from 2009–2020 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) consisted of non-institutionalized US civilians aged ⩾18 ( n = 426 008). We compared proportions of White, Black, and Hispanics among adults reporting no past-year suicidal thoughts/behavior, SI, and SA. Multivariable-adjusted analyses were used to evaluate the independence of observed racial/ethnic differences in past-year SI, SA, and mental health service use. Results In the entire sample, 20 791 (4.9%) reported past-year SI only and 3661 (0.9%) reported a SA. Compared to White individuals, Black and Hispanic individuals were significantly less likely to report past-year SI [OR 0.73 (95% CI 0.69–0.77); OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.71–0.79), respectively], but more likely to report a past-year SA [OR 1.45 (95% CI 1.28–1.64); OR 1.19 (95% CI 1.04–1.37), respectively] even after multivariable adjustment. Black and Hispanic individuals were significantly less likely to use mental health services, but the lack of significant interactions between race/ethnicity and SI/SA in association with service use suggests differences in service use do not account for differences in SI or SA. Conclusions Black and Hispanic individuals are significantly less likely than White individuals to report SI but more likely to report SAs, suggesting differences in suicidal behavior across race/ethnicity that may be impacted by socio-culturally acceptable expressions of distress and structural racism in the healthcare system.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":29},"references":42,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
