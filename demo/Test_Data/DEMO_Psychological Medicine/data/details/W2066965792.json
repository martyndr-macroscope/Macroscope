A systematic review","authors":["Regan A. R.

To help fill this gap, their impact on human brain structure and function has been examined. We systematically discuss this output to facilitate its timely integration in the psychosis research field; and encourage reflection for future research. Irrespective of imaging modality, studies addressing the effect of SZ/BD GWAS risk genes ( ANK3, CACNA1C, MHC, TCF4, NRGN, DGKH, PBRM1, NCAN and ZNF804A ) were included. Most GWAS risk variations were reported to affect neuroimaging phenotypes implicated in SZ/BD: white-matter integrity ( ANK3 and ZNF804A ), volume ( CACNA1C and ZNF804A ) and density ( ZNF804A ); grey-matter ( CACNA1C, NRGN, TCF4 and ZNF804A ) and ventricular ( TCF4 ) volume; cortical folding ( NCAN ) and thickness ( ZNF804A ); regional activation during executive tasks ( ANK3, CACNA1C, DGKH, NRGN and ZNF804A ) and functional connectivity during executive tasks ( CACNA1C and ZNF804A ), facial affect recognition ( CACNA1C and ZNF804A ) and theory-of-mind ( ZNF804A ); but inconsistencies and non-replications also exist. Further efforts such as standardizing reporting and exploring complementary designs, are warranted to test the reproducibility of these early findings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":103},"references":134,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
