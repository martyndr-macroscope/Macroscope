About a third of them were found to be suffering from ‘mental distress’. Younger mothers were more affected. The number and spacing of their children were not related to symptoms of depression and anxiety, but poor personal relationships and difficulties getting out and about were so related, despite relatively affluent circumstances. Children of distressed mothers were more inclined to be disturbed. A controlled trial using amitryptyline involving 25 of the women suggested that this drug can improve depressive symptoms under these circumstances and that the improvement is likely to be maintained over the course of a year.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":7},"references":31,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
