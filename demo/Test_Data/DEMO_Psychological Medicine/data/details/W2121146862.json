In keeping with most previous work, pleasant material was found to be more readily accessible than unpleasant material. In addition, the retrieval rates of both classes of material were found to be influenced by the intensity of affect associated with the memory.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":21},"references":25,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
