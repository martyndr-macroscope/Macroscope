The origins of the unit were described by Dr. Neil O'Connor in an introduction to Studies in Psychiatry (Shepherd and Davies, 1968). This book in honour of Professor Lewis contains six chapters by former unit members summarizing the scientific programme up to that date. A new unit, with the same name, was then set up at the Institute of Psychiatry under the directorship of Professor J. K. Wing, with the aim of investigating social and clinical factors which influence the development of chronic disablement in psychiatric patients and of devising and evaluating techniques of treatment and prevention.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":19,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
