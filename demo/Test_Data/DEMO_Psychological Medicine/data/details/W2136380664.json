In Part 1 the rates are examined for similarities both between the two areas and with findings from other studies in order to obtain pointers to factors affecting the inception of psychiatric disorders. In Part 2 an attempt is made to evaluate an aspect of the community service. Differences between the rates in the two areas are discussed with a view to identifying those variables that selectively affect referral to a community service.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":40},"references":33,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
