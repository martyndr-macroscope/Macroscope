Despite high level of comorbidity, many studies of the immune system in severe mental disorders have not systematically taken cardiometabolic risk factors into account. Methods We investigated if inflammatory markers were increased in schizophrenia (SCZ) and affective (AFF) disorders independently of comorbid CVD risk factors. Cardiometabolic risk factors (blood lipids, body mass index and glucose) and CVD-related inflammatory markers CXCL16, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), soluble CD14 (sCD14), macrophage inhibitory factor and activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) were measured in n = 992 patients (SCZ, AFF), and n = 647 healthy controls. We analyzed the inflammatory markers before and after controlling for comorbid cardiometabolic risk factors, and tested for association with psychotropic medication and symptom levels. Results CXCL16 ( p = 0.03) and sIL-2R ( p = 7.8 × 10 −5 ) were higher, while sCD14 ( p = 0.05) were lower in patients compared to controls after controlling for confounders, with significant differences in SCZ for CXCL16 ( p = 0.04) and sIL-2R ( p = 1.1 × 10 −5 ). After adjustment for cardiometabolic risk factors higher levels of sIL-2R ( p = 0.001) and lower sCD14 ( p = 0.002) remained, also in SCZ (sIL-2R, p = 3.0 × 10 −4 and sCD14, p = 0.01). The adjustment revealed lower ALCAM levels ( p = 0.03) in patients. We found no significant associations with psychotropic medication or symptom levels. Conclusion The results indicate that inflammation, in particular enhanced T cell activation and impaired monocyte activation, are associated with severe mental disorders independent of comorbid cardiometabolic risk factors. This suggests a role of novel pathophysiological mechanisms in severe mental disorders, particularly SCZ.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":50},"references":52,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
