However, this structure needs to be extended to include a broader range of disorders. Method Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine the structure of co-morbidity using data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Surveys ( n = 16 233). Results In the best-fitting model, eating and bipolar disorders formed subfactors within internalizing, impulse control disorders were indicators of externalizing, and factor-analytically derived personality disorder scales split between internalizing and externalizing. Conclusions This was the first large-scale nationally representative study that has included uncommon mental disorders with sufficient power to examine their fit within a structural model of psychopathology. The results of this study have important implications for conceptualizing myriad mental disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":108},"references":60,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
