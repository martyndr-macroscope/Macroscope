One practice was an inner-city urban one and the other was rural. Full follow-up data over the 3-year period was available for 301 patients (84 3%). After three years patients with personality disorder and those in the urban practice had greater morbidity, more contacts with all levels of the psychiatric service and more psychotropic drugs, particularly benzodiazepines. Despite this increased morbidity, the number of consultations with the general practitioner for psychiatric illness was no higher in the urban group and those for medical illness were significantly higher in the rural one. The implications of the findings are discussed with particular reference to developments in community psychiatric care.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":40},"references":40,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
