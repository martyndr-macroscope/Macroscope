Method The present study examined white-matter microstructure in a sample of 52 patients with MDD in different stages (treatment-resistant/chronic MDD, n = 18; remitted-recurrent MDD, n = 15; first-episode MDD, n = 19) and 17 healthy controls, using diffusion tensor imaging with a tract-based spatial statistics approach. Groups were comparable in age and gender distribution, and results were corrected for familywise error (FWE) rate. Results Widespread significant reductions of fractional anisotropy (FA) – including the cingulum, corpus callosum, superior and inferior longitudinal fascicule – were evident in treatment-resistant/chronic MDD compared with first-episode MDD and controls ( p &lt; 0.05, FWE-corrected). Decreased FA was observed within the ventromedial prefrontal region in treatment-resistant/chronic MDD even when compared with the remitted-recurrent MDD group ( p &lt; 0.05, FWE-corrected). Longer duration of illness ( β = –0.49, p = 0.04) and higher depression severity (at a trend level: β = –0.26, p = 0.06) predicted lower FA in linear multiple regression analysis at the whole-brain level. The number of previous episodes and severity of symptoms were significant predictors when focused on the ventromedial prefrontal area ( β = −0.28, p = 0.04; and β = −0.29, p = 0.03, respectively). Medication effects were controlled for in the analyses and results remained unaltered. Conclusions Our findings support the notion that disruptions of white-matter microstructure, particularly in fronto-limbic networks, are associated with resistance to treatment and higher current and past burden of depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":139},"references":55,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
