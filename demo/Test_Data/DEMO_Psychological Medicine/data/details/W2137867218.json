A French version of this instrument was developed and a pilot study of the scale was completed on a clinical sample ( N = 127). As a criterion to gauge its validity, the Rutter scale was used as a concurrent measure. The correlation coefficient between the total scores of the two scales is 0·79, and ranges between 0·22 and 0·96 for individual items. A linear regression analysis, using the total score of the Rutter scale as an independent variable, predicts a value of 41 as the optimal cut-off to be used for the Child Behaviour Checklist. Comparative properties (reliability and time of completion) of the two scales are presented and discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":72},"references":19,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
