However, the relationship between cannabis and suicide remains inconclusive. This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the relationship between cannabis use and suicide-related outcomes in people with schizophrenia. A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO for cross-sectional, case-control, and longitudinal studies was conducted using search terms from database inception to November 2024 inclusive. Computation of odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) was performed using random effects models with DerSimonian-Laird estimation. All studies were appraised for quality. We also evaluated heterogeneity, publication bias and performed sub-group analyses and meta-regression. Twenty-nine studies comprising 36 samples met eligibility criteria. Cannabis use was not associated with odds of suicide death or suicidal ideation but was associated with risks of suicide death (HR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.04 – 1.40) and odds of attempted suicide (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.16 – 1.68). While between-sample heterogeneity was moderate in analyses of attempted suicide ( I 2 = 39.6%, p = 0.03), there was no publication bias. Summary effects remained significant in most sub-groups, but just failed to reach significance in longitudinal studies of attempted suicide (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 0.97 – 1.68) and studies investigating first episode samples (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.99 – 1.55). Cannabis use is significantly associated with some, but not all, suicide-related outcomes in people with schizophrenia. More work is needed to examine potential mechanisms of significant relationships.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":1},"references":85,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
