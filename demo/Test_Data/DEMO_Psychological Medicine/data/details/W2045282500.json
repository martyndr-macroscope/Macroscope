We examined the relationships between clinical characteristics, specific cognitive abilities and social skills performance in middle-aged and older out-patients with schizophrenia and normal comparison subjects. Method One hundred and ninety-four middle-aged and older schizophrenia out-patients and 60 normal comparison subjects were administered a standardized, performance-based measure of social skills using role-plays of various social situations [Social Skills Performance Assessment (SSPA)] and measures of current level of social contact (the Lehman Quality of Life Interview), psychiatric symptom severity [the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)], insight [the Birchwood Insight Scale (IS)] and cognitive functioning [the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS)]. Results Patients demonstrated worse social skills compared with normal subjects. Better performance on the SSPA was associated with having less severe positive and negative symptoms, fewer social contacts, and better attention, initiation/freedom from perseveration, visuospatial ability, abstraction ability and memory. After controlling for demographic, clinical and insight-related factors, abstraction ability was the strongest predictor of social skills performance, followed by frequency of social contact. Conclusions Social functioning (as measured through direct observation of social skills performance) was related to cognitive ability in out-patients with schizophrenia. Addressing such cognitive impairment may help to improve social functioning and result in greater overall quality of life.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":36},"references":38,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
