Broadening formal health-care systems to treat subclinical depression and anxiety is not the answer to reducing this burden, because health-care systems lack the resources even to provide optimal care to clinical cases. The solution proposed is the population-wide dissemination of informal self-help strategies that have evidence for effectiveness. These are highly acceptable to the public, easily applied, inexpensive and may avert the development of many clinical cases.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":102},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
