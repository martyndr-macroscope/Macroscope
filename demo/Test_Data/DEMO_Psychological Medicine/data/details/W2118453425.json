All patients received at least 600 mg chlorpromazine equivalents antipsychotic medication for 6 weeks. Ventricle brain ratios, ratings of cortical sulcal widening and a history of obstetric complications also failed to account for the variability, but early age of onset was associated with unsatisfactory response.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":37},"references":58,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
