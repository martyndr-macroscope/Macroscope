The patients were evaluated for weight variability and for the presence and the frequency of binge eating. Body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE) and metabolic parameters were also measured. When non-bingeing individuals were compared with patients who met Binge Eating Disorder criteria, no differences in body composition, fat distribution, REE values and concentrations of serum lipids, insulin and thyroid hormones were found. On the other hand, weight variability due to reduced diet in the subjects' lifetime was significantly higher. This study does not support the hypothesis that in massively obese women binge eating is somehow induced by a reduced energy expenditure.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":13},"references":11,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
