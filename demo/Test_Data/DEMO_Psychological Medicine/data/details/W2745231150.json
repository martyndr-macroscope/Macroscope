The clinical staging model has been an essential part of early intervention as it provides the rationale of existing programmes. In medicine, clinical staging is a valuable approach in disorders where primary pathology is progressive in nature. However, the clinical staging model of psychosis has been proposed without establishing first that schizophrenia is a primarily progressive disorder. In reviewing existing evidence, this current paper argues that cross-sectional data interpreted as supportive of clinical staging data does not consider the effects of sampling bias, problems in reliability in assessing ‘soft symptoms’, or false positives. Longitudinal neurobiological studies do not provide a convincing case for primarily progressive pathology in schizophrenia. Clinical progression in schizophrenia can be better conceptualised as neuroplastic changes in response to interaction between core developmental pathology and environmental stimuli. An alternative rationale for early and continuous intervention targeting neurodevelopmental abnormality and neuroplastic changes, as well as medical and psychological comorbidities, is proposed in this paper.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":8},"references":65,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
