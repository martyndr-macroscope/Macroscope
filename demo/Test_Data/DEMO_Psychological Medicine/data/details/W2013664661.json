Method We analysed data from the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes study for 447 participants with complete 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self-Report (QIDS-SR 16 ) ratings at baseline and at treatment weeks 2, 4 and 8. We used a multi-time point, recursive subsetting approach that included baseline features and changes in QIDS-SR 16 scores from baseline to weeks 2 and 4, to identify non-responders (&lt;50% reduction in QIDS-SR 16 ) at week 8 with a pre-specified accuracy level. Results Pretreatment clinical features alone were not clinically useful predictors of non-response after 8 weeks of treatment. Baseline to week 2 symptom change identified 48 non-responders (of which 36 were true non-responders). This approach gave a clinically meaningful negative predictive value of 0.75. Symptom change from baseline to week 4 identified 79 non-responders (of which 60 were true non-responders), achieving the same accuracy. Symptom change at both weeks 2 and 4 identified 87 participants (almost 20% of the sample) as non-responders with the same accuracy. More participants with chronic than non-chronic index episodes could be accurately identified by week 4. Conclusions Specific baseline clinical features combined with symptom changes by weeks 2–4 can provide clinically actionable results, enhancing the efficiency of care by personalizing the treatment of depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":17},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
