As indicated by self-report responses on the Hunger–Satiety Questionnaire, bulimics did not differ from the normals in their perceptions of hunger sensations. Differences, however, were detected the responses following eating. Most notably, the bulimics reported feelings of irritability, nervousness, tenseness and depression which persisted 30 minutes later. These findings and directions for future research are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":31},"references":15,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
