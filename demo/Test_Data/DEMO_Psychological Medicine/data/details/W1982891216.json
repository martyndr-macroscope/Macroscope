Tryptophan levels varied significantly with affective state in the short cycle patient and one of the longer cycle patients. Correlation in the short cycle patient was better with blood samples taken at 3 p.m. than at 9 a.m.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":14},"references":16,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
