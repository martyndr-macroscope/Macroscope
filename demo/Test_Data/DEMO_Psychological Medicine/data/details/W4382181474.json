This gap in the literature is particularly critical for pharmacotherapy for BED which is associated with relapse following discontinuation. The current study tested the efficacy of naltrexone/bupropion maintenance treatment amongst responders to acute treatments for BED. Methods Prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-site trial, conducted August 2017–December 2021, tested naltrexone/bupropion as maintenance treatment for responders to acute treatments with naltrexone/bupropion and/or behavioral weight-loss therapy for BED with comorbid obesity. Sixty-six patients (84.8% women, mean age 46.9, mean BMI 34.9 kg/m 2 ) who responded to acute treatments were re-randomized to placebo ( N = 34) or naltrexone/bupropion ( N = 32) for 16 weeks; 86.3% completed posttreatment assessments. Mixed models and generalized estimating equations comparing maintenance treatments (naltrexone/bupropion v. placebo) included main and interactive effects of acute treatments. Results Intention-to-treat binge-eating remission rates following maintenance treatments were 50.0% ( N = 17/34) for placebo and 68.8% ( N = 22/32) for naltrexone/bupropion. Placebo following response to acute treatment with naltrexone/bupropion was associated with significantly decreased probability of binge-eating remission, increased binge-eating frequency, and no weight loss. Naltrexone/bupropion following response to acute treatment with naltrexone/bupropion was associated with good maintenance of binge-eating remission, low binge-eating frequency, and significant additional weight loss. Conclusions Adult patients with BED with co-occurring obesity who have good responses to acute treatment with naltrexone/bupropion should be offered maintenance treatment with naltrexone/bupropion.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":20},"references":41,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
