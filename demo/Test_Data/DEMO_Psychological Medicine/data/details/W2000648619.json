The policy factor made up two-thirds of the total variability (61%) accounted for among males, and nearly one-half of the 47% accounted for among females. An accurate assessment of in-patient resource needs is seen as resulting from intertwining morbidity surveys with utilization studies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":19},"references":23,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
