However, findings are equivocal as to whether extended gains are made post 2 years of EI and whether there is additional benefit of extending EI for an additional 3 years. Methods Data on 178 FEP patients, from a randomized controlled trial of a 3-year extension of EI service v. transfer to regular care following 2 years of EI service, were used for this report. Repeated measures analysis of variance were conducted separately for the initial 2 years of treatment in an EI service, and for the 3-year post-randomization to examine trajectories of negative symptoms over the two periods in the two arms of the study. Results There were significant improvements in total negative symptoms over the first 2 years of EI F (4.612, 797.905) = 25.263, p &lt; 0.001 and in domains of ‘ expressivity ’ and ‘ motivation ’. In the following 3 years, there were further significant improvements in negative symptoms F (4.318, 759.908) = 4.182, p = 0.002 with no difference between groups F (4.318, 759.908) = 1.073, p = 0.371. Changes in negative symptoms over the extension period were driven by expressivity F (4.01, 674.73) = 7.19, p &lt; 0.01, but not motivation F (6.58, 1112.18) = 0.95, p = 0.46. Conclusion Negative symptoms improve significantly over the first 2 years of EI. Subsequent amelioration was largely the result of expressivity. Motivation deficits remained stable. Extended EI offered no advantage over regular care post-randomization.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":24},"references":41,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
