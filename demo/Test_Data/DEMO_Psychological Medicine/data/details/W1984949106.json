Affected sibling pairs provide a valuable means of investigating the familial basis of clinical heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Methods. Associations of schizophrenia subtypes, psychotic symptoms (defined by SAPS/SANS and OPCRIT), affective episodes and demographic variables were studied in 109 sibling pairs with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Results. None of the subtypes or affective episodes were significantly associated within pairs. A broad definition of positive formal thought disorder, grandiose delusions and delusions of influence (all from OPCRIT) were modestly associated. There was no excess of same-sex pairs. There were modest associations for age of illness onset, pre-morbid adjustment and illness severity. Caution is required in interpreting the results because many statistical tests were carried out. Conclusions. None of the variables appears to be closely associated with specific genetic or shared environmental factors that contribute liability to schizophrenia. They are at best only weakly associated with such factors, and/or are associated with factors unrelated to the aetiology of schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":37},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
