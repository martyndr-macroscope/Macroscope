The validity of the GHQ-28 was 0·83 (95% confidence interval: 0·70 to 0·93) using the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS) as the validating criterion. The effectiveness of the GHQ-28 as a screening instrument using CIS 11/12 as case criterion, and thus a prevalence rate of 0·18, was judged by relative operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC curve was 0·91±0·03. “Optimum’ discrimination occurred near GHQ 3/4 (0011 scoring scheme) giving a sensitivity of 0·81, a specificity of 0·82 and a misclassification rate of 18%.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":26},"references":34,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
