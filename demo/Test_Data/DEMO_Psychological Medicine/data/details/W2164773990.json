In order to redress this imbalance, the report summarizes the methods and results of a prospective study of a permanent factory shutdown, thereby illustrating and dissecting some of the strengths and weaknesses of the micro-epidemiological level of analysis. This leads to a broader analysis of research strategy questions which consider macro and micro approaches and variations on the two.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":75},"references":46,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
