Previous data suggests that pairing iTBS with D-cycloserine, a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist, improves antidepressant outcomes. However, its impact on suicide risk is not known. Methods We examine suicidal ideation and implicit suicide risk after iTBS+D-cycloserine in two clinical trials (open-label trial [ n = 12] and randomized placebo-controlled trial [RCT, n = 50]) involving adults with major depressive disorder and the acute effects of D-cycloserine on implicit suicide risk in a crossover trial ( n = 18). Implicit suicide risk was assessed using the computerized death/suicide implicit association test (IAT), and depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were assessed using the clinician-rated Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Results Open-label iTBS+D-cycloserine was associated with a rapid reduction in suicidal ideation, and iTBS+D-cycloserine was superior to iTBS+placebo in reducing suicidal ideation. Similarly, open-label iTBS+D-cycloserine was associated with decreased implicit suicide risk as measured by the death/suicide IAT, and iTBS+D-cycloserine was associated with greater decreases in death/suicide IAT scores compared to iTBS+placebo. A single acute dose of D-cycloserine in the absence of iTBS had no effect on implicit suicide risk. Conclusions Adjunctive D-cycloserine with iTBS is a promising strategy to reduce suicidal ideation and implicit suicide risk in depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":4},"references":57,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
