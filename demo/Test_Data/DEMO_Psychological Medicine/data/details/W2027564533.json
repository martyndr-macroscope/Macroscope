Although the slow-release tablets showed slow-release in vitro , this was not so in vivo. One slow-release preparation, in particular, was ineffectively absorbed by some subjects. There was no difference in the rate of absorption and excretion between the other slow-release product and the standard BP preparation. The implications of the results are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":40},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
