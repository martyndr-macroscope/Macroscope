In order to develop suitable measurements, distinctions are drawn between symptoms, states, deviant and normal traits, which have implications for the distributions of scores and for their stability or change over time. Measures likely to meet the criteria are illustrated. A classification is developed which incorporates those with and without the ability to cope with personal symptomatology and/or personality deviance. Some uses of the classificatory scheme and the measurements are suggested.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":38},"references":21,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
