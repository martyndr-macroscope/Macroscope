Very few of the 82 men and 53 women were married or capable of employment, and both psychiatric and physical morbidity were high; 2 young men committed suicide and 3 elderly men died within a year of discharge. Over the age of 45 men tended to be socially isolated and over the age of 60 they were also physically ill; a number probably required better residential care. Few women under 45 attended, possibly because the services offered were unacceptable.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":19},"references":10,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
