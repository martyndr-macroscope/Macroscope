Since obtaining brain tissue is challenging, most research has shifted to analyzing miRNAs in peripheral blood. One innovative solution is sequencing miRNAs in plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly those neural-derived EVs emanating from the brain. Methods We isolated plasma neural-derived EVs from 85 patients with BD and 39 healthy controls (HC) using biotinylated antibodies targeting a neural tissue marker, followed by miRNA sequencing and expression analysis. Furthermore, we conducted bioinformatic analyses and functional experiments to delve deeper into the underlying pathological mechanisms of BD. Results Out of the 2,656 neural-derived miRNAs in EVs identified, 14 were differentially expressed between BD patients and HC. Moreover, the target genes of miR-143-3p displayed distinct expression patterns in the prefrontal cortex of BD patients versus HC, as sourced from the PsychENCODE database. The functional experiments demonstrated that the abnormal expression of miR-143-3p promoted the proliferation and activation of microglia and upregulated the expression of proinflammatory factors, including IL-1β, IL-6, and NLRP3. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, a module linking to the clinical symptoms of BD patients was discerned. Enrichment analyses unveiled these miRNAs’ role in modulating the axon guidance, the Ras signaling pathway, and ErbB signaling pathway. Conclusions Our findings provide the first evidence of dysregulated plasma miRNAs within neural-derived EVs in BD patients and suggest that neural-derived EVs might be involved in the pathophysiology of BD through related biological pathways, such as neurogenesis and neuroinflammation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":52,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
