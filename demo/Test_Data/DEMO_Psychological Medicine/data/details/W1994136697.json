We review the limited neuropsychological literature on impaired attention in depressive states, with emphasis on areas where the findings of modern cognitive research might be applied in the future to design more sophisticated tests of attentional impairment. At present, it is not possible to determine whether the attentional deficits seen in depression are specific to this disorder, or whether they represent a final common pathway of impaired cognition seen in many different mental and organic deficit states, such as schizophrenia and dementias.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":110},"references":109,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
