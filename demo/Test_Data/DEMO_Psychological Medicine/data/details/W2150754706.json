This paper describes a simple, practical method for increasing recall by the organization of medical information into ‘labelled’ categories. The success of this technique was demonstrated first in a laboratory experiment with volunteer subjects, and then in a naturalistic setting with general practice patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":158},"references":11,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
