Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of amygdala along with its interactions with the whole brain during implicit and explicit conditions in MDD. Methods Thirty MDD patients and 26 healthy controls (HCs) underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and performed implicit and explicit emotional face recognition tasks with happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions. Using the amygdala as a seed region, time frequency representations (TFR) and functional connectivity (FC) were calculated. Pearson correlation analyses measured the relationship between TFR and FC values with clinical symptoms. Results During implicit processing, MDD patients exhibited left amygdala activation in the gamma power (60–70 Hz) before 250 ms in response to sad facial stimuli compared to HCs. In the implicit mode, there were increased FC between the right amygdala and several brain regions in the occipitoparietal lobes, as well as higher FC between the left amygdala and putamen in MDD patients. Additionally, the right amygdala was positively correlated with the severity of depression and anxiety during implicit processing. Conclusions MDD patients had lateralized amygdala activation in response to sad facial expressions during unconscious emotional recognition of facial stimuli. Our study provided valuable insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of facial emotional recognition associated with depressive and anxiety-related cognitive bias during implicit and explicit processing.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":53,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
