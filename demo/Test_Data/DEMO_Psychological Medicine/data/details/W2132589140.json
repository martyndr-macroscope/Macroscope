Genetic effects upon behaviour are pervasive. To what extent are the many correlates of major depression (MD) due to individual-specific environmental experiences versus genetic factors correlated with risk for MD? Methods. From a population-based twin registry, we identified 72 female monozygotic pairs discordant for a lifetime history of MD and compared the affected and unaffected members on a wide range of putative correlates of MD. Results. The affected twin differed from her unaffected co-twin on many variables, eight of which were maximally discriminating: ( i ) maternal protectiveness; ( ii ) conflictual parent–child relationship; ( iii ) low optimism; ( iv ) current stressful life events; ( v ) financial difficulties and a history of ( vi ) phobia, ( vii ) nicotine dependence; and ( viii ) divorce. A cluster analysis suggested three ‘environmental pathways' to MD characterized by: ( i ) childhood vulnerability and anxiety; ( ii ) acting-out and demoralization; and ( iii ) interpersonal difficulties. Conclusion. Important precursors and sequelae of MD originate in environmental experiences unique to the individual and are not mediated through genetic factors or family-of-origin effects. Such environmental factors cause pervasive differences in monozygotic twins discordant for MD, especially in the areas of interpersonal difficulties, psychopathology, social problems and self-concept. These findings should be interpreted in the context of possible retrospective recall bias and the difficulty of distinguishing risk factors from sequelae in co-twin–control studies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":104},"references":32,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
