The effect would only account for approximately 0·7 out of the average of 46 parasuicides per 100000 adults per lunar cycle (95% CI 0·6–0·8), and fails to reach statistical significance.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":23},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
