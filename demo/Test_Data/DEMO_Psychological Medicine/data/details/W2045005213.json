Eighty per cent of the sample were examined, using the Hierarchic Dementia Scale to test cognitive functioning and the CAMDEX criteria to assess global clinical severity. Repeat assessment after a mean interval of 27 months showed that all new cases of clinical dementia had arisen in persons with mild deficits initially and represented one-fifth of this group. The first-assessment ratings of cognitive function proved to be strongly predictive of risks for age-corrected mortality, admission to long-term care and dependency at follow-up, as well as of further progressive cognitive decline.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":47},"references":31,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
