Radius of gyration (R g ) is a measure of the mean dispersion of points in a radially organized structure about that structure's centre of gravity. We developed computerized methods for estimating R g of the magnetic resonance image (MRI) boundary between cortex and subcortex, and applied these methods to measurement of cerebral hemispheric asymmetry in 37 schizophrenics (SZs) and 30 controls (CONs). In right-handed CONs, R g of right brain boundaries was significantly greater than R g of left brain boundaries; in left-handed CONs, R g of left brain boundaries was significantly greater than R g of right brain boundaries. In right-handed males (both SZ and CON), there were significant differences in R g between hemispheres; whereas in females (both SZ and CON) there were no such differences. Right-handed male SZs ( N = 26) were distinguished by reversal of the right-handed male CON pattern of interhemispheric difference in R g , and by global reduction in R g of right brain boundaries. There was no evidence for significant abnormality of R g in right-handed female SZs ( N = 7). These findings suggest an important interactive effect of gender and schizophrenia on lateralized cerebral structure.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":44},"references":55,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
