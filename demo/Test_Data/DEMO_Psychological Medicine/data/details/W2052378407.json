Data were collected from self-report questionnaires, from an interview rated for Expressed Emotion (EE) and from direct observation of a family problem solving task which was rated for evidence of Minuchin's ‘psychosomatic family’ dimensions. A total of 87 families participated. Most self-report measures of family functioning did not distinguish between groups. There were no differences in levels of EE criticism. AN and CF households showed more EE emotional over-involvement than did the well households. Over-involvement correlated with illness severity. More households in the AN group were enmeshed, over-protective and poor at problem solving than in the CF and well groups. Minuchin's conceptualization of the anorexia nervosa family was partly supported.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":57},"references":44,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
