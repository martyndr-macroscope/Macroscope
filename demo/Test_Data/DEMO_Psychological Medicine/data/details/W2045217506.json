The observed relationship between symptom severity and hippocampal volume suggests that mesial temporal lobe dysfunction may directly mediate certain aspects of PTSD and dissociative disorder symptomatology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":915},"references":73,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
