While BSs are considered the most immediate expression of neurobiological aberrations underlying the development of psychosis, research on neurobiological correlates of BS is scarce. Methods We investigated gray matter volumes (GMV) of 20 regions of interest (ROI) previously associated with UHR criteria in 90 patients from the Bern early detection service: clinical controls (CC), first-episode psychosis (FEP), UHR, BS and UHR&amp;BS. We expected lowest GMV in FEP and UHR&amp;BS, and highest volume in CC with UHR and BS in-between. Results Significantly, lower GMV was detected in FEP and UHR&amp;BS patients relative to CC with no other significant between-group differences. When ROIs were analyzed separately, seven showed a significant group effect (FDR corrected), with five (inferior parietal, medial orbitofrontal, lateral occipital, middle temporal, precuneus) showing significantly lower GM volume in the FEP and/or UHR&amp;BS groups than in the CC group (Bonferroni corrected). In the CHR group, only COGDIS scores correlated negatively with cortical volumes. Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate that patients who fulfill both UHR and BS criteria – a population that has been associated with higher conversion rates – exhibit more severe GMV reductions relative to those who satisfy BS or UHR criteria alone. This result was mediated by the BS in the UHR&amp;BS group, as only the severity of BS was linked to GMV reductions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":6},"references":79,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
