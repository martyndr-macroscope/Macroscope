Parents’ harsh reactions have been associated with children’s irritable behavior. While studies have shown individual associations of irritability and parenting behaviors with suicide risk, few have considered these factors jointly. We aimed to identify profiles of children based on irritability and parenting during childhood and examine their associations with youth suicide attempt. Methods Participants ( N = 1626) were from the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. Mothers reported on childhood irritability, harsh parenting, and positive parenting between ages 3.5 and 8; youth self-reported suicide attempt between ages 13 and 23. Results We identified four profiles based on the joint development of irritability and parenting during childhood: (1) low irritability, low harsh parenting, and high positive parenting (30.3%); (2) moderate irritability, moderate harsh parenting, and high positive parenting (28.4%); (3) moderate irritability, moderate harsh parenting, and low positive parenting (26.6%); and (4) high irritability, high harsh parenting, and low positive parenting (14.8%). In logistic regression analyses, only children in the high irritability, high harsh parenting, and low positive parenting profile had higher odds of attempting suicide (OR = 2.51; 95% CI = 1.55–4.09) compared to those in the low irritability, low harsh parenting, and high positive parenting profile. This association remained significant (OR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.03–3.15) in models adjusting for covariates. Conclusion Children with chronically high irritability were also those experiencing the harshest parenting and the least positive parenting, as well as those most at risk of suicide attempt. Targeting both child and parental behavior may maximize suicide prevention efforts among children with high irritability.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":47,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
