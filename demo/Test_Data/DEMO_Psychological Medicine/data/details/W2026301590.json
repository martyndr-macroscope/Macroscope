To replicate and further investigate this issue, prospective data from two independent population-based studies, the Greek National Perinatal Study ( n =1636) and The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS) ( n =4842), were analyzed. Method Two different data sets on cannabis use and childhood maltreatment were used. In a large Greek population-based cohort study, data on cannabis use at age 19 years and childhood maltreatment at 7 years were assessed. In addition, psychotic symptoms were assessed using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE). In NEMESIS, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess psychotic symptoms at three different time points along with childhood maltreatment and lifetime cannabis use. Results A significant adjusted interaction between childhood maltreatment and later cannabis use was evident in both samples, indicating that the psychosis-inducing effects of cannabis were stronger in individuals exposed to earlier sexual or physical mistreatment [Greek National Perinatal Study: test for interaction F (2, 1627)=4.18, p =0.02; NEMESIS: test for interaction χ 2 (3)=8.08, p =0.04]. Conclusions Cross-sensitivity between childhood maltreatment and cannabis use may exist in pathways that shape the risk for expression of positive psychotic symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":12,"cited_by_count":102},"references":94,"networkCitations":12,"seed":false}
