It is based upon the conceptual distance between people. For each subject, the observed distances between all possible pairs of elements were calculated and compared with the expected distance between two elements drawn at random. The ratios derived in this way were used to examine intra-self alienation and actual self isolation. The obsessional patient is self alienated and isolated. The normal control subject is self and socially integrated.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":19},"references":11,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
