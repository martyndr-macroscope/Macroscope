This study examines the interplay between childhood trauma, cannabis use, and paranoia using standard tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) units as a comprehensive measure of cannabis exposure. Methods Data were derived from the Cannabis&amp;Me study, an observational, cross-sectional, online survey of 4,736 participants. Childhood trauma was assessed using a modified Childhood Trauma Screen Questionnaire, while paranoia was measured via the Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale. Cannabis use was quantified using weekly standard THC units. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to evaluate direct and indirect pathways between trauma, cannabis use, and paranoia. Results Childhood trauma was strongly associated with paranoia, particularly emotional, and physical abuse ( β = 16.10, q &lt; 0.001; β = 16.40, q &lt; 0.001). Cannabis use significantly predicted paranoia ( β = 0.009, q &lt; 0.001). Interactions emerged between standard THC units and both emotional abuse ( β = 0.011, q &lt; 0.001) and household discord ( β = 0.011, q &lt; 0.001). SEM revealed a small but significant indirect effect of trauma on paranoia via cannabis use ( β = 0.004, p = 0.017). Conclusions These findings highlight childhood trauma as a primary driver of paranoia, with cannabis use amplifying its effects. While trauma had a strong direct impact, cannabis played a significant mediating role. Integrating standard THC units into psychiatric research and clinical assessments may enhance risk detection and refine intervention strategies, particularly for childhood trauma-exposed individuals.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":0},"references":48,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
