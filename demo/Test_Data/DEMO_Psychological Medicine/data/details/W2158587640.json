Two suffered from bipolar illnesses, 2 from recurrent unipolar illness, and the remainder showed alcoholism, depression and schizo-affective disorder. HLA typing revealed that all the tested members shared the antigens A3 and B7. Because only ill members were available for testing, there was insufficient information in the family to draw any definite conclusion as to whether these antigens were linked to the illness. However, the observation is of some interest in the light of other recent reports which have suggested that these 2 antigens are associated with affective disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":15,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
