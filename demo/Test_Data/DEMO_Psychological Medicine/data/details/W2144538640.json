Besides oxytocin, vasopressin\\n\\nand specific brain areas, it has also been suggested\\n\\nthat neurotrophins (NTs) might be involved. NTs are a\\n\\nfamily of structurally similar proteins including nerve\\n\\ngrowth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic\\n\\nfactor (BDNF) amongst others, which play an important\\n\\nrole in the survival, differentiation and functioning\\n\\nof neurons (Patapoutian &amp; Reichardt, 2001). Preclinical\\n\\nstudies suggest that BDNF might be involved in\\n\\nhippocampal degeneration (Duman et al. 1997) following\\n\\ndifferent stressors, such as maternal deprivation\\n\\n(Meaney, 2001). The BDNF changes would\\n\\nrender adult animals more vulnerable to exaggerated\\n\\nstress responses and anxious behaviours (Ladd et al.\\n\\n2004). These findings suggest that BDNF, and perhaps\\n\\nall NTs, might act as mediators to translate the effects\\n\\nof environmental stimuli on the development of the\\n\\n‘ social brain’.\\n\\nA type of social attachment that seems to be\\n\\npeculiar to humans is the so-called ‘romantic attachment’,\\n\\nwhich is the establishment of a relationship\\n\\nbetween two sexual partners (Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987).\\n\\nGiven the lack of information on this topic, we\\n\\nexplored the possible relationship between BDNF\\n\\nplasma levels and romantic attachment, as assessed\\n\\nby the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire\\n\\n(Brennan et al. 1998), a self-report instrument\\n\\nfor measuring romantic attachment in adults.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":17,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
