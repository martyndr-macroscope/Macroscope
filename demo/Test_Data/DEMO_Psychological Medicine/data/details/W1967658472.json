The task had two components: cued response and spatial memory. Relative to controls, the dyskinetic subjects showed a superior cued response performance but an equal spatial memory ability. We speculate that this selective facilitation may reflect dopaminergic hyperactivity in the dyskinetic group.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
