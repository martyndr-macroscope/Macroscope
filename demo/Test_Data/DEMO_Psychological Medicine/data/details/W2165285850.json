A follow-up to 1968 identified all children from the survey attending a child guidance clinic or appearing in court within that time. Those thus identified contained a significantly high proportion of boys who were reported as having more than 3 deviant items (i.e. occurring in approximately 10% of subjects in 1961). Specific health and behavioural items were found to have been reported in 1961 in proportions which were significantly different for children later appearing in child guidance clinic from those appearing in court. The amount of concern expressed by their parents over psychological and behavioural items distinguished court from clinic boys, while the concern shown by parents over items of physical health showed little difference in these 2 groups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":9,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
