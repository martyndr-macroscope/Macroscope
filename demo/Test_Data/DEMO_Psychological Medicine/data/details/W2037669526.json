Of the remaining 73 women, 30 never gave evidence of ‘high distress’. Deficits in social support, health and financial problems correlate with enduring ‘high distress’. Personality traits consonant with a socially acceptable and expected ‘widow role’ were found to differentiate the women with enduring ‘low distress’.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":143},"references":23,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
