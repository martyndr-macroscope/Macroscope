The effect of prolonged lithium administration on RNA synthesis in rat brain and liver has been studied. Differences in the rate of turnover of brain RNA between the lithium-treated and saline control animals have been observed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":6},"references":8,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
