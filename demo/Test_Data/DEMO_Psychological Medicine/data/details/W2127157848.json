In addition, recent research in the field of life event stress has indicated that life experiences occurring prior to a pregnancy may influence pregnancy outcome. The present study examines the ability of life event stress as well as a variety of medical, social and psychological variables to predict complications of pregnancy. In contrast to previous small-sample research, the present study examines 782 subjects. Multivariate statistical techniques are employed to analyse the numerous variables measured. Results suggest that ‘age at birth of first child’, ‘education level’, ‘menstrual history’, ‘attitudes to pregnancy’ and ‘age at menstruation’ best predict obstetric difficulties. However, only a small percentage of the variance of pregnancy complication scores is explained by these factors.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":43},"references":37,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
