Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is a promising treatment but no previous study has assessed the cost-effectiveness or long-term outcome of ICBT for severe health anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness and 1-year treatment effects of ICBT for severe health anxiety. Method Cost-effectiveness and 1-year follow-up data were obtained from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing ICBT ( n = 40) to an attention control condition (CC, n = 41). The primary outcome measure was the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). A societal perspective was taken and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using bootstrap sampling. Results The main ICER was −£1244, indicating the societal economic gain for each additional case of remission when administering ICBT. Baseline to 1-year follow-up effect sizes on the primary outcome measure were large ( d = 1.71–1.95). Conclusions ICBT is a cost-effective treatment for severe health anxiety that can produce substantial and enduring effects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":101},"references":48,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
