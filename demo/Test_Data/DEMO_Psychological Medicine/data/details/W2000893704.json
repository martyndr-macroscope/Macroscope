Such stimuli elicit more anxiety in agoraphobic patients than control subjects. The effect of visual stimulation appears to be specific: (1) non-visual stimulation is without comparable effect; (2) both control and agoraphobic groups show similar effects of visual stimulation on another reaction such as headache. The anxiety effects of visual stimuli are correlated with the extent to which subjects experience depersonalization and somatic symptoms of agoraphobia, but not correlated with depression or the behavioural or cognitive aspects of agoraphobia. Alternative accounts of the possible role of visual stimulation in the anxiety reactions of agoraphobic patients are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":19},"references":31,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
