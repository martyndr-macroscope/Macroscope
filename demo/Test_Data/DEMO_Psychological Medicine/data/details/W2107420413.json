To extend these observations and examine further the association between severity of depressive symptoms and values of NK activity, this study used a longitudinal case control design and assessed NK cytotoxicity at intake and at follow-up 6 months after discharge from the hospital in depressed patients and control subjects. From acute hospitalization to follow-up, depression scores significantly ( P &lt; 0·01) decreased following treatment in the depressed patients but did not change in the control subjects. NK activity significantly ( P &lt; 0·05) increased from intake to follow-up in the depressives while lytic activity did not change in the controls. At intake NK activity was significantly ( P &lt; 0·01) reduced in the depressed patients as compared to values in the controls, while at follow-up cytotoxicity was similar between the two groups. These longitudinal data suggest that a reduction of NK cytotoxicity is temporally associated with the state of acute depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":110},"references":33,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
