Intervention approaches that target executive dysfunction alongside standard PTSD treatments could boost clinical response. The current study reports secondary analyses from a randomized controlled trial testing combined PTSD treatment with a computerized training program to improve executive dysfunction. We assessed if pre-treatment neurocognitive substrates of executive functioning predicted clinical response to this novel intervention. Methods Treatment-seeking veterans with PTSD ( N = 60) completed a working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging prior to being randomized to six weeks of computerized executive function training (five 30-minute sessions each week) plus twelve 50-minute sessions of cognitive processing therapy (CEFT + CPT) or placebo training plus CPT (PT + CPT). Using linear mixed effects models, we examined the extent to which the neurocognitive substrates of executive functioning predicted PTSD treatment response. Results Results indicated that veterans with greater activation of working memory regions (e.g. lateral prefrontal and cingulate cortex) had better PTSD symptom improvement trajectories in CEFT + CPT v. PT + CPT. Those with less neural activation during working memory showed similar trajectories of PTSD symptom change regardless of treatment condition. Conclusions Greater activity of frontal regions implicated in working memory may serve as a biomarker of response to a novel treatment in veterans with PTSD. Individuals with greater regional responsiveness benefited more from treatment that targeted cognitive dysfunction than treatment that did not include active cognitive training. Clinically, findings could inform our understanding of treatment mechanisms and may contribute to better personalization of treatment.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":83,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
