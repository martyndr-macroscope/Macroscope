Chlormethiazole in doses over l g was found to be effective in depressing REM sleep and in blocking the REM sleep rebound when sodium amylobarbitone (400 mg) was stopped abruptly.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":9},"references":32,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
