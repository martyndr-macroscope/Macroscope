We hypothesized that ‘pre-acculturation’ would protect against mental disorder, that difficulties in the period immediately after migration would increase the risk of disorder, and that disorder would be least common among those in the middle range of the acculturation spectrum. Of pre-acculturation factors, only previous knowledge of English was associated with reduced prevalence. Difficulties in the settling-in period were clearly related to current disorder. No relationship was apparent between present acculturation and disorder, but this disguised an interesting but unpredicted gender effect: in males, disorder was most prevalent in the highly acculturated; in females, in the least acculturated.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":39},"references":47,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
