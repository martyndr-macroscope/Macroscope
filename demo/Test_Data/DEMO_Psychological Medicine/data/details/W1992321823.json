Parents of 144 10–15-year-old ConHD-children completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and 179, 11–17-year-old, ConHD-adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR). On the CBCL and YSR ConHD-children and adolescents obtained significantly higher problem scores than same-aged peers from normative reference groups. No significant differences were found between problem scores for different cardiac diagnostic groups. A negative correlation was found between CBCL total problem scores and IQ-scores of ConHD-children; for YSR total problem scores no such relationship was found.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":169},"references":21,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
