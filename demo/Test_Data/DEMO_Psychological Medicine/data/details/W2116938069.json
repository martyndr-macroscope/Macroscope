It discusses the marked changes which occurred in the social composition of its patients and the way in which these changes modified the asylum's management and therapy. It argues that the conventional image of the Retreat, based as it is on the institution's earliest years, needs considerable revision.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":13},"references":20,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
