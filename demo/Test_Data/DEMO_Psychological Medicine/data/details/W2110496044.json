It was thought that such ‘labelling’ effects might be important in ambiguous situations, such as neurotic anxiety–depressive states, where diagnoses of ‘reactive depression’ or ‘anxiety state’ might justifiably be made and treatment with either diazepam or nortripyline legitimately given. The depression label and its concomitant two-weekly prediction of improvement with antidepressants produced a set towards slower response with higher self-report depression. Nortriptyline produced significantly more improvement in self-report depression than diazepam in the first 2 weeks of treatment. No significant interaction effects were detected between diagnosis or drug. One month after the initial diagnostic evaluation there were no significant effects from either diagnostic label or drug.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":14,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
