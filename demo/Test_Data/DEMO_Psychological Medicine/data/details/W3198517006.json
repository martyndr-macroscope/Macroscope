Yet, their interrelationships have remained elusive. The aim of this study was to examine the multi-cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between (change in) smoking and alcohol use and (change in) number of depressive symptoms. Methods In this prospective, longitudinal study, 6646 adults from the general population were included with follow-up measurements after 3 and 6 years. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test multi-cross-sectional and longitudinal associations, with smoking behaviour, alcohol use and genetic risk scores for smoking and alcohol use as independent variables and depressive symptoms as dependent variables. Results In the multi-cross-sectional analysis, smoking status and number of cigarettes per day were positively associated with depressive symptoms ( p &lt; 0.001). Moderate drinking was associated with less symptoms of depression compared to non-use ( p = 0.011). Longitudinally, decreases in the numbers of cigarettes per day and alcoholic drinks per week as well as alcohol cessation were associated with a reduction of depressive symptoms ( p = 0.001–0.028). Results of genetic risk score analyses aligned with these findings. Conclusions While cross-sectionally smoking and moderate alcohol use show opposing associations with depressive symptoms, decreases in smoking behaviour as well as alcohol consumption are associated with improvements in depressive symptoms over time. Although we cannot infer causality, these results open avenues to further investigate interventions targeting smoking and alcohol behaviours in people suffering from depressive symptoms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":16},"references":70,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
