The sample comprises 139 employed and unemployed men. Using standardized psychological questionnaires with a semi-structured interview schedule, the psychological consequences of unemployment are examined in relation to other psychosocial variables. The results showed that the unemployed group had lower levels of psychological well-being, selfesteem, and employment commitment with high external beliefs, than the employed group. Length of unemployment was a significant determinant of psychological well-being and respondents with a longer period of unemployment had a lower level of psychological well-being than those who had been unemployed for a shorter period. The findings are examined in the context of existing empirical evidence, and the need to examine the psychological impact of unemployment among other British Asian groups is emphasized.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":44},"references":54,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
