The association appears to be confined to certain families, and affective disorder may appear as long as 20 years before the onset of chorea and dementia. The association may represent genetic heterogeneity in HD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":223},"references":32,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
