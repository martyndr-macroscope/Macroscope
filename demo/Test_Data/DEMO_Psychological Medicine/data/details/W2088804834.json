Assignment by the empirically developed algorithm is contrasted with assignment by DSM-III-R and with several other melancholia subtyping indices. Both the numbers of ‘melancholies’ assigned by the several systems and their capacity to distinguish ‘melancholics’ on clinical, demographic and a biological index test (the DST) varied across the systems with the algorithm being as ‘successful’ as several systems that include inter-episode and treatment response variables. Analyses provide information on the criteria set developed for DSM-IV definition of ‘melancholia’.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":23},"references":13,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
