Various factors affect bone mineral density (BMD) such as polydipsia, nicotine, alcohol abuse, lack of physical activity, an unbalanced diet, a lack of ultraviolet exposure and/or vitamin D. In addition, decreased BMD in women with schizophrenia has been attributed to drug-induced hyperprolactinaemia and/or secondary hypogonadism. This study was undertaken because empirical evidence from larger patient cohorts is limited and the data are still controversial. Method Seventy-two premenopausal, regularly menstruating women suffering from schizophrenia and 71 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in the study. Biochemical markers of bone turnover (serum osteocalcin, urinary pyridinium crosslinks), parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured. BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a subgroup of 59 patients. In addition, 17β-oestradiol, prolactin, testosterone, gonadotrophins and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured. Results Compared with healthy controls, both markers of formation and resorption were increased in women with schizophrenia. However, in the subgroup of 59 patients, BMD was within the normal range. In women suffering from schizophrenia, testosterone levels were higher than in controls, and serum oestradiol levels were lower compared with the normal range. Conclusion Despite significantly increased bone turnover, we conclude that premenopausal and regularly menstruating women suffering from schizophrenia have normal spine and hip BMD. This may be due to the opposite effects of the various parameters influencing bone metabolism, especially of the gonadal hormones, and due to an intact coupling mechanism.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":36},"references":51,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
