The characteristics of these patients were compared with the total population admitted. No particular diagnostic category was associated with rapid readmissions but the rapidly readmitted group contained a high proportion of young patients and divorced or separated patients. The case notes of rapidly readmitted patients were examined and compared with the case notes of a control group. The circumstance which predisposed patients to require rapid readmission was the degree of socially disruptive behaviour of the patient. Patients benefited from readmission and the reasons for this are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":27},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
