Method An elastic net and random forest were trained to predict depression symptoms and related disability after an 8-week course of an Internet intervention, Deprexis, involving adults ( N = 283) from across the USA. Candidate predictors included psychopathology, demographics, treatment expectancies, treatment usage, and environmental context obtained from population databases. Model performance was evaluated using predictive R 2 $\\lpar R_{{\\rm pred}}^2\\rpar\\comma $ the expected variance explained in a new sample, estimated by 10 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. Results An ensemble model was created by averaging the predictions of the elastic net and random forest. Model performance was compared with a benchmark linear autoregressive model that predicted each outcome using only its baseline. The ensemble predicted more variance in post-treatment depression (8.0% gain, 95% CI 0.8–15; total $R_{{\\rm pred}}^2 \\; $ = 0.25), disability (5.0% gain, 95% CI −0.3 to 10; total $R_{{\\rm pred}}^2 \\; $ = 0.25), and well-being (11.6% gain, 95% CI 4.9–19; total $R_{{\\rm pred}}^2 \\; $ = 0.29) than the benchmark model. Important predictors included comorbid psychopathology, particularly total psychopathology and dysthymia, low symptom-related disability, treatment credibility, lower access to therapists, and time spent using certain Deprexis modules. Conclusion A number of variables predict symptom improvement following an Internet intervention, but each of these variables makes relatively small contributions. Machine learning ensembles may be a promising statistical approach for identifying the cumulative contribution of many weak predictors to psychosocial depression treatment response.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":77},"references":50,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
