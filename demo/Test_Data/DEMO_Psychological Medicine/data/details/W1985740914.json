However, a sampling of historical sources reveals that not only are there warnings in the writings of both Hippocrates and Aristotle concerning the dangers of excessive intake of cold or iced water, but a series of medical works, from the sixteenth century on, incorporate discussion and illustrative case histories about the detrimental effect of immoderate usage of cold water, ice and snow, frequently in the context of disordered eating.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":36},"references":26,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
