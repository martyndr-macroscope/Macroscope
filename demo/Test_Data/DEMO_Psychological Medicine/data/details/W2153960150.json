In addition, Afro-Caribbean patients are compared with white UK-born patients. Relative rates of admission are examined. The study confirms other reports of greater than expected compulsory admissions of Afro-Caribbean patients and pays particular attention to the circumstances preceding compulsory entry to hospital and the persons and agencies involved in that process.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":55},"references":32,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
