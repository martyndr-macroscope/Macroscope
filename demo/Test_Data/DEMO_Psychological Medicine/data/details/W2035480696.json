The per cent inhibition of platelet MAO after both doses was not related to acetylator status. Phenelzine, since it is a hydrazine derivative, is probably metabolized by polymorphic acetylation. Patients who were phenotypically slow acetylators have been reported to show a better clinical response (Johnstone &amp; Marsh, 1973) and more side-effects (Evans et al. 1965) to a given dose of phenelzine than patients who were fast acetylators.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":7},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
