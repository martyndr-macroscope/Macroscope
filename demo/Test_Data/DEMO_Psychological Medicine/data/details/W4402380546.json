We developed an algorithm to identify posts containing suicide-related content on a military-specific social media platform. Methods Publicly-shared social media posts ( n = 8449) from a military-specific social media platform were reviewed and labeled by our team for the presence/absence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors and used to train several machine learning models to identify such posts. Results The best performing model was a deep learning (RoBERTa) model that incorporated post text and metadata and detected the presence of suicidal posts with relatively high sensitivity (0.85), specificity (0.96), precision (0.64), F1 score (0.73), and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.84. Compared to non-suicidal posts, suicidal posts were more likely to contain explicit mentions of suicide, descriptions of risk factors (e.g. depression, PTSD) and help-seeking, and first-person singular pronouns. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the feasibility and potential promise of using social media posts to identify at-risk Servicemembers and Veterans. Future work will use this approach to deliver targeted interventions to social media users at risk for suicide.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":39,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
