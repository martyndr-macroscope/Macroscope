Methods Four primary care cohorts of UK children (pregnancy, 1 and 2 years prior to pregnancy, and siblings) born between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2017 were constructed. NDD included autism/autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. Maternal exposures included depression/anxiety and/or infection. Maternal (age, smoking status, comorbidities, body mass index, NDD); child (gender, ethnicity, birth year); and area-level (region and level of deprivation) confounders were captured. The NDD incidence rate among (1) children exposed during or outside of pregnancy and (2) siblings discordant for exposure in pregnancy was compared using Cox-regression models, unadjusted and adjusted for confounders. Results The analysis included 410 461 children of 297 426 mothers and 2 793 018 person-years of follow-up with 8900 NDD cases (incidence rate = 3.2/1000 person years). After adjustments, depression and anxiety consistently associated with NDD (pregnancy-adjusted HR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.46–1.72; 1-year adj. HR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.39–1.60; 2-year adj. HR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.50–1.74); and to a lesser extent, of infection (pregnancy adj. HR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.10–1.22; 1-year adj. HR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.14–1.27; 2-year adj. HR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.12–1.25). NDD risk did not differ among siblings discordant for pregnancy exposure to mental illness HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.77–1.21 or infection HR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.90–1.08. Conclusions Maternal risk appears to be unspecific to pregnancy: our study provided no evidence of a specific, and therefore causal, link between in-utero exposure to infection, common mental illness, and later development of NDD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":37,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
