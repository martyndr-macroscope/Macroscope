Patients receiving both neuroleptic and anticholinergic drugs show this disparity, performing less well on recall than on recognition. These patients also seem more severely disturbed. The importance of task matching, drugs and chronicity are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":69},"references":41,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
