Personality is an important determinant of suicidal behaviour. However, it has been studied little in relation to suicidal behaviour in depression. Methods. Depressed patients who had attempted suicide ( N =41) were compared with depressed patients who had never attempted suicide ( N =56) and normal controls ( N =56) for their scores on three personality questionnaires. Results. Introversion was the only personality dimension where the post hoc test showed a different pattern between the two groups of depressed patients in their relation to controls. In particular, only depressed patients who had attempted suicide had significantly lower introversion scores than controls. Conclusion. The personality dimension of introversion may be a risk factor for suicidal behaviour in depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":30},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
