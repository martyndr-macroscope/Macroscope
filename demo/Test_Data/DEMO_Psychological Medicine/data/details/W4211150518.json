Methods Using a population representative sample of 5088 adults aged •50 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we investigated relationships of polygenic predisposition to general cognition with a rate of change in cognition during a 10-year follow-up period. Polygenic predisposition was measured with polygenic scores for general cognition (GC-PGS). Cognition was measured employing tests for verbal memory and semantic fluency. Results The average baseline memory score was 11.1 ( s.d. = 2.9) and executive function score was 21.5 ( s.d. = 5.8). An increase in GC-PGS by one standard deviation (1- s.d. ) was associated with a higher baseline verbal memory by an average 0.27 points (95% CI 0.19–0.34, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, 1- s.d. increase in GC-PGS was associated with a higher semantic fluency score at baseline in the entire sample ( β = 0.45, 95% CI 0.27–0.64, p &lt; 0.001). These associations were significant for women and men, and all age groups. Nonetheless, 1- s.d. increase in GC-PGS was not associated with decreases in verbal memory nor semantic fluency during follow-up in the entire sample, as well stratified models by sex and age. Conclusion Although common genetic variants associated with general cognition additively are associated with a stable surplus to cognition in adults, a polygenic predisposition to general cognition is not associated with age-related cognitive decline during a 10-year follow-up.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":54,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
