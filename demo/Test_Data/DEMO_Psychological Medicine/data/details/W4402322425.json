However, very limited information is available about deficits in effort-cost-decision-making in the early stages of psychotic disorder and no study has investigated effort allocation deficits before the onset of bipolar disorder. Our aim was to investigate effort-based-decision-making in ultra-high-risk for psychosis (UHR-P) and bipolar disorder (UHR-BD). Methods Effort-cost decision-making performance was evaluated in UHR-P ( n = 72) and UHR-BD ( n = 68) and healthy controls ( n = 38). Effort-Expenditure for Reward Task (EEfRT) was used. Results Compared to controls, both UHR-P and UHR-BD groups were associated with a reduced possibility to choose the harder task when the reward magnitudes and/or the likelihood of receiving the reward were high. In both groups, effort allocation abnormalities were associated with poor social functioning. Conclusions The current findings suggest that difficulties in effort-cost computation are transdiagnostic markers of illness liability in psychotic and bipolar disorders. In early intervention services, effort-based decision-making abnormalities should be considered as a target for interventions to manage motivational deficits in individuals at high risk for psychosis and BD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":4},"references":46,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
