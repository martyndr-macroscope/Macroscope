A global cognitive score, sensitive to the stages of the spectrum, would benefit the exploration of potential factors involved in the cognitive decline. Methods First, we performed principal component analysis on cognitive scores from 768 individuals across the schizophrenia spectrum, including first-degree relatives of patients, individuals at ultra-high risk, who had a first-episode psychosis, and chronic schizophrenia patients, alongside 124 healthy controls. The analysis provided 10 g-factors as global cognitive scores, validated through correlations with intelligence quotient and assessed for their sensitivity to the stages on the spectrum using analyses of variance. Second, using the g-factors, we explored potential mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in the schizophrenia spectrum using correlations with sociodemographic, clinical, and developmental data, and linear regressions with genotypic data, pooled through meta-analyses. Results The g-factors were highly correlated with intelligence quotient and with each other, confirming their validity. They presented significant differences between subgroups along the schizophrenia spectrum. They were positively correlated with educational attainment and the polygenic risk score (PRS) for cognitive performance, and negatively correlated with general psychopathology of schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental load, and the PRS for schizophrenia. Conclusions The g-factors appeared as valid estimators of global cognition, enabling discerning cognitive states within the schizophrenia spectrum. Educational attainment and genetics related to cognitive performance may have a positive influence on cognitive functioning, while general psychopathology of schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental load, and genetic liability to schizophrenia may have an adverse impact.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":82,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
