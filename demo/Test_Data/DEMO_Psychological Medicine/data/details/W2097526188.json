Of the sample, 13·4%, report depressive symptoms above the cut-off. A significant association was found between CES-D and MMS scores, but after adjusting for age, living arrangements, and especially functional limitations, the relationship remained strong only for women.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":100},"references":58,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
