The present study adds two additional aspects of validity using multiple discriminant analysis applied to two widely used taxonomic systems. Scales of anxiety and depression derived from previous latent trait analyses are applied to individuals reaching criteria for ‘caseness’ on the ID-CATEGO system and the DSM-III system, both at initial diagnosis and six months later. The first multiple discriminant analysis is carried out on the initial scale scores, and the results are interpreted in terms of concurrent validity. The second analysis uses improvement scores on the two scales and relates to predictive validity. It is argued that the ID-CATEGO system provides a better classification for common mental illnesses than the DSM-III system, since it allows a better discrimination to be made between anxiety and depressive disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":15},"references":6,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
