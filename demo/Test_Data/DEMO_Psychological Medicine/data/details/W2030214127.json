The prevalence, 2·04 per 1000, was lower than that found in previous studies. The fact that many other patients showed both the high consultation rates and the other correlates of Briquet's Syndrome brings the usefulness of a discrete syndrome into doubt.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":26},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
