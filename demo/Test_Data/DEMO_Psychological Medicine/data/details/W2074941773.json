The diagnoses given to these patients by the U.S./U.K. Project psychiatrists were compared with diagnoses given the same patients by the hospital psychiatrists in the two countries. Similar levels of agreement were obtained between hospital and Project psychiatrists in the two countries and, where the alcoholic patients were removed, the proportion diagnosed as schizophrenic by the Project in the two samples was identical.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":20},"references":17,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
