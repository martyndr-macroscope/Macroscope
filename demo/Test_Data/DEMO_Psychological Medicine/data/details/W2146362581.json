Each subject was given tests of reproductive skill with both concrete pictures and unfamiliar and unnameable geometric designs. They were also asked to draw a man, and a test of picture completion was given which involved constructive imagination. In all tests the idiots savants proved clearly superior to IQ-matched controls, indicating the presence of an IQ-independent talent. The results are interpreted in terms of a superior image memory and ready access to a ‘picture lexicon’. In addition, the existence of superior graphically directed motor programmes must be assumed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":65},"references":24,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
