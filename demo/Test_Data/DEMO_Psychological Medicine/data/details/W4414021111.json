We investigated whether ethnicity, clinical, pathways to care (PtC) characteristics, and access to early intervention service (EIS) influenced the offer, uptake, and type of PT in an FEP sample. Methods We used data from the Clinical Record Interactive Search-First Episode Psychosis study. Inferential statistics determined associations between ethnicity, clinical, PtC, and PT offer/uptake. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the odds of being offered a PT and type of PT by ethnicity, clinical and PtC characteristics adjusting for confounders. Results Of the 558 patients included, 195 (34.6%) were offered a PT, and 193 accepted. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) ( n = 165 of 195; 84.1%) was commonly offered than group therapy ( n = 30 of 195; 13.3%). Patients who presented via an EIS (adj. OR = 2.24; 95%CI 1.39–3.59) were more likely to be offered a PT compared with those in non-EIS. Among the patients eligible for an EIS, Black African (adj. OR = 0.49; 95%CI = 0.25–0.94), Black Caribbean (adj. OR = 0.45; 95%CI = 0.21–0.97) patients were less likely to be offered CBT compared with their White British counterparts. Patients with a moderate onset of psychosis (adj. OR = 0.34; 95%CI = 0.15–0.73) had a reduced likelihood of receiving CBT compared with an acute onset. Conclusions Accessing EIS during FEP increased the likelihood of being offered a PT. However, treatment inequalities remain by ethnicity and clinical characteristics.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":40,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
