Estimations of striatal concentrations of dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) indicated that these lesions had no influence either on normal striatal DA turnover or on the enhancement of DA turnover induced by neuroleptics. Behavioural experiments suggested a motor output function for the striatonigral pathway.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":30},"references":67,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
