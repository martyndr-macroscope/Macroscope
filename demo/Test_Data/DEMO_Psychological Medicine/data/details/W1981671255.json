The prevalence rate is shown to be highly dependent on the particular definition of ‘alcoholism’ which is employed. Long-term and short-term prisoner subgroups are compared, and similarities with a population of non-prisoner homeless men discussed. A ‘dependence score’ derived from an operant conditioning model of alcoholism correlates significantly with various measures of social instability.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":28},"references":30,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
