They share a common behavioral phenotype: deficits in inhibitory control (IC). However, whether this is underpinned by shared neurobiology remains unclear. In this meta-analytic study, we aimed to define and compare brain functional alterations during IC tasks in MDD and PUD. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search on IC task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in MDD and PUD (cocaine or methamphetamine use disorder) in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. We performed a quantitative meta-analysis using seed-based d mapping to define common and distinct neurofunctional abnormalities. Results We identified 14 studies comparing IC-related brain activation in a total of 340 MDD patients with 303 healthy controls (HCs), and 11 studies comparing 258 PUD patients with 273 HCs. MDD showed disorder-differentiating hypoactivation during IC tasks in the median cingulate/paracingulate gyri relative to PUD and HC, whereas PUD showed disorder-differentiating hypoactivation relative to MDD and HC in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule. In conjunction analysis, hypoactivation in the right inferior/middle frontal gyrus was common to both MDD and PUD. Conclusions The transdiagnostic neurofunctional alterations in prefrontal cognitive control regions may underlie IC deficits shared by MDD and PUD, whereas disorder-differentiating activation abnormalities in midcingulate and parietal regions may account for their distinct features associated with disturbed goal-directed behavior.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":121,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
