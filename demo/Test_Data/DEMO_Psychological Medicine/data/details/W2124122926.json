Studies about the effect of time on the degree of psychological distress among immigrants have reported conflicting findings. We investigated this issue in Israel, which supports actively the absorption of immigrants, and also looked for risk and protective factors for psychological distress 5 years post-immigration. Method. A nationwide sample of 600 subjects who emigrated from the former Soviet Union to Israel in 1990 were interviewed in 1995, with the demoralization subscale of the Psychiatric Epidemiologic Research Interview (PERI-D) for psychological distress, and with a series of questions regarding sociodemographic characteristics, personal assets and their absorption experience. The results were compared with those obtained in a previous study for a sample of the same cohort of immigrants in their first year post-immigration. A multivariate analysis was carried out to examine the relation between the PERI score and the different independent variables. Results. Although, 5 years after immigration, a favorable change in objective parameters of absorption was found, no decrease in psychological distress was observed. The main risk factors remaining significantly associated with psychological distress in the final model were: adverse life events, lack of perceived social support, poor family functioning, external locus of control, poor physical health status, non-identification with host society and, to a lesser degree, poor material conditions. Conclusion. Psychological readjustment apparently takes longer than other processes of adaptation. Several years after immigration, social and psychological factors have a more important role for the well-being of immigrants than their material conditions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":73},"references":25,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
