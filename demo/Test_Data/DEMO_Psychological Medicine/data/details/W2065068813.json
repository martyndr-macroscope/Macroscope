In the index group the ventricle–brain ratio (VBR) was significantly greater. The VBR values were positively correlated with average alcohol intake and with early physical trauma, and negatively correlated with a family history of schizophrenia. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the present uncertainty about the meaning of CT scan findings in schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":137},"references":30,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
