The total mass of tryptophan in the body may be reduced in people prone to affective disorder, and in depressed patients (ill and well) turnover of tryptophan seemed to be reduced. The reduction of concentration of tryptophan in compartment S 2 in affective illness could affect protein synthesis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":18},"references":9,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
