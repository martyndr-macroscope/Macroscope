In an attempt to define the cellular basis of the reported immune disorders, the present study investigates the leukocyte cell subset profile of minor, simple major, and melancholic depressives, versus normal controls. We have counted the number of white blood cells (WBC) lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes, while the number of lymphocyte (sub)populations has been identified by phenotype, using monoclonal antibody staining in conjunction with flow cytometry. The following cell surface antigens were determined: CD3 + (pan T), CD19 + (pan B), CD4 + (T helper/inducer), CD8 + (T suppressor/cytotoxic), CD4 + CD45RA (T-memory cells), CD4 + CD45RA + (T-virgin cells), surface Ig, class II MHC HLA-DR, and CD25 + (IL-2 receptor). By means of pattern recognition methods, we established distinct immunological changes in minor and simple major depressed and in melancholic patients, setting them apart from the reference population. Depression, per se , is characterized by a higher number of WBC, monocytes, class II MHC HLA-DR, and memory T cells. Minor and simple major depressives exhibited an increased T helper/suppressor ratio. Increased numbers of IL-2 receptor bearing cells are a hallmark for major depression. Melancholics showed an increased number of pan T, pan B and T suppressor/cytotoxic cells. It was concluded that the established immune cell profile of depressed patients may point towards the existence of a systemic immune activation during that illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":275},"references":67,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
