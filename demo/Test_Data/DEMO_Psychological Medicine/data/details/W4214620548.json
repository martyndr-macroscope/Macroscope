This randomized controlled study evaluated the efficacy of one such intervention program called Resilience Training (RT). Methods College students who reported mildly elevated depressive or subclinical psychotic symptoms (‘psychotic experiences' (PEs)) ( n = 107) were randomized to receiving RT ( n = 54) or to a waitlist control condition ( n = 53). RT consists of a four-session intervention focused on improving resilience through the acquisition of mindfulness, self-compassion, and mentalization skills. Measures of symptoms and these resilience-enhancing skills were collected before and after the 4-week RT/waitlist period, with a follow-up assessment 12-months later. Results Compared to the waitlist control group, RT participants reported significantly greater reductions in PEs, distress associated with PEs, depression, and anxiety, as well as significantly greater improvements in resilience, mindfulness, self-compassion, and positive affect, following the 4-week RT/waitlist period (all p &lt; 0.03). Moreover, improvements in resilience-promoting skills were significantly correlated with symptom reductions (all p &lt; 0.05). Lastly, the RT-related reductions in PEs and associated distress were maintained at the 12-month follow-up assessment. Conclusions RT is a brief, group-based intervention associated with improved resilience and reduced symptoms of psychopathology, with sustained effects on PEs, in transdiagnostically at-risk young adults. Follow-up studies can further assess the efficacy of RT relative to other interventions and test whether it can reduce the likelihood of developing a serious mental illness.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":33},"references":76,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
