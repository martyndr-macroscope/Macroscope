There have been 25 cases previously reported in the literature which appear to be fairly typical of the condition and the present paper adds the case histories of another six patients. Endocrine investigation on these patients reveals a disorder of urinary excretion levels of testosterone and of total gonadotrophic activity, which is comparable to the disturbance of sex hormones that accompanies the menstrual disturbance of female patients with anorexia nervosa. The exact nature of the endocrine disturbance in the male, however, is still less well understood than that in the female.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":131},"references":50,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
