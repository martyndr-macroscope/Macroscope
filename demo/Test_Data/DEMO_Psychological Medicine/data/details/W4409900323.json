This study examined the efficacy and safety of VR therapy in stable outpatients with psychosis and explored relationships between primary outcomes and psychological factors using path analysis. Methods Seventy-eight patients were randomly assigned to either the VR-treatment (VR-T) or VR-control (VR-C) group. The VR-T group viewed three 360° 3D videos or four animated videos; the VR-C group viewed the same seven videos with muted voices or 11 360° 3D videos of natural scenes. Pre- and post-assessments were performed using the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale-Delusions (PSYRATS-D) and Revised Green et al. Paranoid Thought Scale (R-GPTS) as a primary outcome measure. Several self-rating scales measuring schema, depression, brooding, negative evaluation, attribution bias, and self-esteem were administered. Safety was assessed after sessions 1 and 10, and path models were constructed. Results Between-group analysis showed a significant improvement in PSYRATS-D scores in the VR-T group compared with the VR-C group. Regarding self-rating scales, the between-group analysis revealed a significant group × time interaction only for the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) score. The frequency of VR sickness was high, but its severity was mild. Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale and Beck Depression Inventory scores were found to have mediating roles. Conclusions VR therapy effectively reduced delusions in young, stable psychosis patients with mild and tolerable side effects. Future studies should develop diverse VR content for older populations.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":1},"references":59,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
