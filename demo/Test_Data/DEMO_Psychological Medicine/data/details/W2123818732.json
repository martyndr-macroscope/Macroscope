The test was designed to measure changes in the symptoms of neurotic patients participating in experiments in therapeutics such as drug trials. In all studies the test scores discriminated significantly between psychiatric patients and normals. In drug trials the test was found to be effective in discriminating between the responses to psychotropic drugs and to placebo. The findings suggest that the test is a valid and reliable measure of distress.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":14,"cited_by_count":282},"references":33,"networkCitations":14,"seed":false}
