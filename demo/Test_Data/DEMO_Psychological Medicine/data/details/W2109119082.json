However, methodological issues, including the reliance on diagnosis at first presentation have limited the validity of outcome studies to date. Method We conducted a first-episode follow-up study of 97 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia over the first 4 years of illness. First presentation and follow-up assessments were compared using paired t tests and a forced-entry regression analysis was used to determine prognostic variables. Results There were significant improvements in positive and negative symptoms and global assessment of functioning between first presentation and follow-up. At first presentation, fewer negative symptoms ( t =−3.40, p &lt;0.01), more years spent in education ( t =3.25, p &lt;0.01), and a shorter duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) ( t =−2.77, p &lt;0.01) significantly predicted a better outcome at follow-up. Conclusions The outcome of schizophrenia may not be as pessimistic as once thought and most patients did not display a downward deteriorating course of illness. This study supports the relationship between DUP and outcome beyond the early stages of illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":45},"references":38,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
