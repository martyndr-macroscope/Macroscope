Late-life depression is associated with increased subcortical white matter hyper-intensities. There is some evidence that they are associated with a poorer response to acute treatment. Neurological signs and neuropsychological dysfunction are further evidence of abnormalities in the brain, but they have not been studied in relation to therapy resistance. Methods. A prospective study of 24 normal controls and 75 consecutive elderly (aged 65 to 85) patients with DSM-III-R major depression entered a naturalistic study of treatment. Assessment of response to monotherapy and then lithium augmentation or ECT created three outcome groups. Investigations included magnetic resonance brain imaging, neuropsychological and neurological examination. Results. Response to monotherapy within 12 weeks was shown by 42·7%, a further 37·3% responded to lithium augmentation or ECT within 24 weeks and 20% had responded poorly to all treatments at 24 weeks. Subcortical hyperintensities were significantly increased in the more resistant patients. These included confluent deep white matter, multiple (&gt;5) basal ganglia lesions and pontine reticular formation lesions. Most of the neuropsychological impairment was restricted to the resistant groups and was of a subcortico-frontal type. Extrapyramidal, frontal and pyramidal neurological signs characterized the resistant groups. The combination of extrapyramidal signs, pyramidal tract signs and impairment of motor hand sequencing strongly predicted resistance to 12 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy with 89% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Conclusion. In late-life depression a poor response to antidepressant monotherapy can be expected in those patients with a frontal lobe syndrome, extrapyramidal signs or if MRI T 2 -weighted lesions are present in both the basal ganglia and the pontine reticular formation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":252},"references":19,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
