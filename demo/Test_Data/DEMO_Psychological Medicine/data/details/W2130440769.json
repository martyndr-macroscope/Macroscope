Premorbid asociality was assessed with the Pre-morbid Asociality Adjustment Scale in 411 patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder categorized as being either neuroleptic-responsive or neuroleptic-resistant. Patterns of childhood and adolescent asociality were found to be different in neuroleptic-resistant and neuroleptic-responsive patients. Pre-morbid asociality during the pre-adult years was not consistently worse in patients with poor response to neuroleptic treatment. Greater impairment in late adolescent psychosexual functioning was predictive of poor outcome with regard to neuroleptic treatment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":12},"references":30,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
