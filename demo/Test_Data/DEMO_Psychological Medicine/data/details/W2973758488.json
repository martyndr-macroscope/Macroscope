Although some evidence indicates that maternal intake of fish and n-3 PUFAs is associated with reduced risk of postpartum depression, the results are inconsistent. Methods We investigated whether dietary consumption of fish and/or n-3 PUFAs during pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of maternal postpartum depression at 6 months after delivery and of serious mental illness at 1 year in a Japanese population. After exclusion and multiple imputation from a dataset comprising 103 062 pregnancies obtained in the Japan Environment and Children's Study, we evaluated 84 181 and 81 924 women at 6 months and 1 year after delivery, respectively. Results Multivariable logistic regression showed a reduced risk of postpartum depression at 6 months in the second to fifth quintiles v . the lowest quintile for fish and n-3 PUFA intake, with trend tests also revealing a significant linear association. At 1 year after delivery, fish intake was associated with a reduced risk of serious mental illness in the second to fifth quintiles v . the lowest quintile for fish and in the third to fifth quintiles v . the lowest quintile for n-3 PUFA intake, with trend tests also revealing a significant linear association. Conclusions Women with higher fish and/or n-3 PUFA intake showed reduced risk of postpartum depression at 6 months after delivery and of serious mental illness at 1 year after delivery.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":37},"references":49,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
