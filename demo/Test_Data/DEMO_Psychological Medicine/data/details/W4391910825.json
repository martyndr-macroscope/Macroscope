While often studied in family designs, few studies and none with genetic measures, have examined SPD in epidemiological samples. Methods We studied individuals born in Sweden 1940–2000 with an ICD-10 diagnosis of SPD with no prior schizophrenia (SZ) diagnosis ( n = 2292). Demographic features, patterns of comorbidity, and Family Genetic Risk Scores (FGRS) were assessed from multiple Swedish registries. Prediction of progression to SZ was assessed by Cox models. Results SPD was rare, with a prevalence of 0.044%, and had high levels of comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), OCD, ADHD, and major depression (MD), and increased rates of being single, unemployed and in receipt of welfare. Affected individuals had elevated levels of FGRS for SZ (+0.42), ASD (+0.30), MD (+0.29), and ADHD (+0.20). Compared to cases of schizophrenia, they had significantly lower rates of FGRS SZ , but significantly elevated rates of genetic risk for ASD, MD, and ADHD. Over a mean follow-up of 8.7 years, 14.6% of SPD cases received a first diagnosis of SZ, the risk for which was significantly increased by levels of FGRS SZ , male sex, young age at SPD diagnosis and an in-patient SPD diagnosis and significantly decreased by comorbidity with MD, ASD, and ADHD. Conclusions Our results not only support the designation of SPD as a schizophrenia spectrum disorder but also suggest potentially important etiologic links between SPD and ASD and, to a lesser extent, ADHD, OCD, and MD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":3},"references":62,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
