However, there are few studies of dynamic FC analysis, which can provide information about fluctuations in neural activity related to cognition and behavior. The goal of the present study was therefore to investigate the dynamic aspects of FC in adolescent MDD patients. Methods Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 94 adolescents with MDD and 78 healthy controls. Independent component analysis, a sliding-window approach, and graph-theory methods were used to investigate the potential differences in dynamic FC properties between the adolescent MDD patients and controls. Results Three main FC states were identified, State 1 which was predominant, and State 2 and State 3 which occurred less frequently. Adolescent MDD patients spent significantly more time in the weakly-connected and relatively highly-modularized State 1, spent significantly less time in the strongly-connected and low-modularized State 2, and had significantly higher variability of both global and local efficiency, compared to the controls. Classification of patients with adolescent MDD was most readily performed based on State 1 which exhibited disrupted intra- and inter-network FC involving multiple functional networks. Conclusions Our study suggests local segregation and global integration impairments and segregation-integration imbalance of functional networks in adolescent MDD patients from the perspectives of dynamic FC. These findings may provide new insights into the neurobiology of adolescent MDD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":56,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
