When subsequently tested at normal thyroxine levels, these experimental subjects showed less positive social behaviour when compared with controls. When confronted with unfamiliar monkeys, the two experimental groups were less fearful than controls and also showed a lack of differential responsiveness in varying social situations, suggesting a low level of emotion. A foetal athyreotic group is also described.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":20,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
