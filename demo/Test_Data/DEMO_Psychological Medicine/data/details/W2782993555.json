We prospectively examined vulnerability and scar effects in mental and physical functioning in a representative Dutch population sample. Methods Three waves were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2, a population-based study with a 6-years follow-up. Mental and physical functioning were assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36). Major depressive disorder (MDD) was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Vulnerability effects were examined by comparing healthy controls ( n = 2826) with individuals who developed a first-onset depressive episode during first follow-up but did not have a lifetime diagnosis of MDD at baseline ( n = 181). Scarring effects were examined by comparing pre- and post-morbid functioning in individuals who developed a depressive episode after baseline that was remitted at the third wave ( n = 108). Results Both mental ( B = −5.4, s.e. = 0.9, p &lt; 0.001) and physical functioning ( B = −8.2, s.e. = 1.1, p &lt; 0.001) at baseline were lower in individuals who developed a first depressive episode after baseline compared with healthy controls. This effect was most pronounced in people who developed a severe episode. No firm evidence of scarring in mental or physical functioning was found. In unadjusted analyses, physical functioning was still lowered post-morbidly ( B = −5.1, s.e. = 2.1, p = 0.014), but this effect disappeared in adjusted analyses. Conclusions Functional impairments after remission of depression seem to reflect a pre-existing vulnerability rather than a scar.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":21},"references":49,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
