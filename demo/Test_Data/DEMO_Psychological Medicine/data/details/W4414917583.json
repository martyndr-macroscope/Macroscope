This study examined the effects of intermittent treatment with escitalopram (vs. placebo) on a behavioral measure of impulsivity and inattentiveness in women reporting high levels of premenstrual irritability and anger. Methods Participants ( N = 27) rated cardinal PMDD mood symptoms over three menstrual cycles using Visual Analogue Scales. In Cycles 2 and 3, participants displaying cyclicity with respect to the irritability/anger item received escitalopram (20 mg) or placebo in a randomized, single-blind, crossover design. The participants completed the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT 3) in the luteal phase of the intervention cycles. Additionally, they filled out the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale, once in the luteal phase and once in the follicular phase of the placebo cycle. Results In line with previous reports, escitalopram caused a significant reduction in self-rated irritability and anger in the luteal phase. When on escitalopram, the participants demonstrated a lower frequency of anticipatory responses and greater consistency in response speed in the CPT 3. With respect to self-reported impulsivity, participants reported higher levels of urgency and lower levels of sensation seeking in the luteal placebo phase versus the follicular phase. Conclusions The finding that escitalopram impacted the outcome of the CPT 3 test in women with premenstrual irritability highlights the possible role of impulsivity in this condition.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":43,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
