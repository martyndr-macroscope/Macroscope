However, the genetic basis linking sociability with DMN function remains underexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the shared genetics and causal relationship between sociability and DMN-related resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) traits. Methods We conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis using large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for sociability and 31 activity and 64 connectivity DMN-related rs-fMRI traits ( N = 34,691–342,461). We performed global and local genetic correlations analyses and bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess shared and causal effects. We prioritized genes influencing both sociability and rs-fMRI traits by combining expression quantitative trait loci MR analyses, the CELLECT framework – integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data with GWAS – and network propagation within a protein–protein interaction network. Results Significant local genetic correlations were identified between sociability and two rs-fMRI traits, one representing spontaneous activity within the temporal cortex, the other representing connectivity between the cingulate and angular/temporal cortices. MR analyses suggested potential causal effects of sociability on 12 rs-fMRI traits. Seventeen genes were highly prioritized, with LINGO1 , ELAVL2 , and CTNND1 emerging as top candidates. Among these, DRD2 was also identified, serving as a robust internal validation of our approach. Conclusions By combining genomic and transcriptomic data, our gene prioritization strategy may serve as a blueprint for future studies. Our findings can guide further research into the biological mechanisms underlying sociability and its role in the development, prognosis, and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":108,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
