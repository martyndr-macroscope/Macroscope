Severity of intent was associated with the act's medical seriousness and with the risk of suicide derived from a validated risk scale. Although high and low intent cases were comparable in respect of precipitating factors, patients rated high on suicidal intent were more likely to have experienced depressive symptoms in the previous month.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":47},"references":30,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
