We assessed the cost-effectiveness of Outreach and Support in South London (OASIS), a service for people with an at-risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis. Method The costs of OASIS compared to care as usual (CAU) were entered in a decision model and examined for 12- and 24-month periods, using the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and rate of transition to psychosis as key parameters. The costs were calculated on the basis of services used following referral and the impact on employment. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of all the assumptions made in the model. Results Over the initial 12 months from presentation, the costs of the OASIS intervention were £1872 higher than CAU. However, after 24 months they were £961 less than CAU. Conclusions This model suggests that services that permit early detection of people at high risk of psychosis may be cost saving.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":114},"references":32,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
