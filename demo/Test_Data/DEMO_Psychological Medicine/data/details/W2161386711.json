We report here a study of the cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) in schizophrenia compared to control groups, as well as the clinical correlates of this congenital anomaly in schizophrenia. We conducted a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study to compare rates of CSP in schizophrenia ( N = 67) v . psychiatric controls (bipolar and schizoaffective, N = 60) and healthy controls ( N = 37). Of the controls 18·9 %, and of all psychotic subjects 18·1 % had a CSP of any size and there was no difference in the frequency of large CSP among the groups. Males had higher rates of CSP than females (25% v . 9·7%, P = 0·01) in all groups. Schizophrenics had higher CSP rates than affective patients (25%, v . 10%, P = 0·02). No clinical difference was found between schizophrenics with or without CSP.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":66},"references":23,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
