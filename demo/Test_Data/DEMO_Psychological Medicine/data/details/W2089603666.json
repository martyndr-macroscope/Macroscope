The survey was based on 45 English and German language studies published between 1953 and 1981. During the past decade there has been a striking increase of publications related to eating disorders in general. This pertains as well to follow-up studies on anorexia nervosa. In addition to studies compiled in our previous report, we were able to locate another 22 follow-up studies published in major English and German language journals between 1981 and 1989.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":211},"references":41,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
