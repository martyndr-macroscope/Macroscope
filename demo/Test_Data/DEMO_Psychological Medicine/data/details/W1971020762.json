A new procedure is described which employs a simple modification to a standard video camera to produce an image which appears from 20% thinner to 40% fatter than the actual person, without other distortion of the image. Reliability and preliminary validity data for the new procedure are presented.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":85},"references":33,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
