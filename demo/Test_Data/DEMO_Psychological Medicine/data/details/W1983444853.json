The patients were of below average intelligence, and substantial numbers were characterized by low drive to return to work, unrealistic attitudes, a lack of self-confidence, and adverse attitudes towards the existence and extent of handicap. An evaluative and experimental study subsequently indicated that a rehabilitation programme was unsuccessful in changing attitudes and returning patients to industrial roles in the community. Aspects of outcome such as work status were predicted by earlier assessments of motivation, self-confidence, and patients' view of the presence and extent of handicap; outcome was not predicted by the initial assessments of work level, length of unemployment, intellectual level, and the realism of attitudes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":32},"references":18,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
