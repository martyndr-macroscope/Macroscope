This very long-term follow-up study aimed to examine the diagnostic stability of FEP diagnoses, the baseline predictors of diagnostic change and the timing of diagnostic change. Methods This was a longitudinal and naturalistic study of 243 subjects with FEP who were assessed at baseline and reassessed after a mean follow-up of 21 years. The diagnostic stability of DSM-5 psychotic disorders was examined using prospective and retrospective consistencies, logistic regression was used to establish the predictors of diagnostic change, and survival analysis was used to compare time to diagnostic change across diagnostic categories. Results The overall diagnostic stability was 47.7%. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were the most stable diagnoses, with other categories having low stability. Predictors of diagnostic change to schizophrenia included a family history of schizophrenia, obstetric complications, developmental delay, poor premorbid functioning in several domains, long duration of untreated continuous psychosis, spontaneous dyskinesia, lack of psychosocial stressors, longer duration of index admission, and poor early treatment response. Most of these variables also predicted diagnostic change to bipolar disorder but in the opposite direction and with lesser effect sizes. There were no significant differences between specific diagnoses regarding time to diagnostic change. At 10-year follow-up, around 80% of the diagnoses had changed. Conclusions FEP diagnoses other than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder should be considered as provisional. Considering baseline predictors of diagnostic change may help to enhance diagnostic accuracy and guide therapeutic interventions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":24,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
