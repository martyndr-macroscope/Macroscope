He showed no change during a placebo control period, but within a few days of starting replacement treatment with testosterone he reported a return of sexual interest and showed a response to sexually arousing stimuli; sexual attitudes also improved. This case is of interest because of the specific and rapid psychological response to the correction of an androgen deficiency.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":23},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
