The estimated prevalence of psychiatric disorder in this sample was 18%: only 28% of the psychiatric morbidity so identified was detected by physicians. In contrast, physicians rated 10% of the sample as psychiatric ‘cases’ using a simple 6-point scale.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":27},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
