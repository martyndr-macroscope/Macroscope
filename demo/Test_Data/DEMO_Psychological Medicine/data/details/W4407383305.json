However, data are scarce on the role of specific ACEs as well as the potential mediating role of adverse mental health symptoms in this association. Methods A cohort study using the nationwide Icelandic Stress-And-Gene-Analysis (SAGA, 22,423 women) cohort and the UK Biobank (UKB, 86,492 women) was conducted. Participants self-reported on five ACEs. Twelve autoimmune diseases were self-reported in SAGA and identified via hospital records in UKB. Poisson regression was used to assess the cross-sectional association between ACEs and autoimmune diseases in both cohorts. Using longitudinal data on self-reported mental health symptoms in the UKB, we used causal mediation analyses to study potential mediation by depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms in the association between ACEs and autoimmune diseases. Results The prevalence of ACEs was 50% in SAGA and 35% in UKB, while the prevalence of autoimmune diseases was 29% (self-reported) and 14% (clinically confirmed), respectively. In both cohorts, ACEs were associated with an increased prevalence ratio (PR) of any studied autoimmune disease in a dose–response manner (PR = 1.10 (95%CI = 1.08–1.12) per ACE), particularly for Sjögrens (PR = 1.34), polymyalgia rheumatica (PR = 1.20), rheumatoid arthritis (PR = 1.14), systemic lupus erythematosus (PR = 1.13), and thyroid disease (PR = 1.11). Sexual abuse and physical and emotional neglect were consistently associated with an elevated prevalence of autoimmune diseases when including all ACEs in the model. Approximately one fourth of the association was mediated through depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Conclusions These findings based on two large cohorts indicate a role of ACEs and corresponding mental health distress in autoimmune diseases among adult women.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":3},"references":39,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
