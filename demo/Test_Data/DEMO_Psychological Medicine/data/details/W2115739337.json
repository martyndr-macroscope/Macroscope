A two-stage case finding strategy was applied with a newly developed and validated screening questionnaire (CHQ), and a modified Chinese version of the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-CV). The total response rate was 99·4% and there was no time lag between the CHQ screening and the second stage clinical interview conducted by a psychiatrist. The weighted validity of the CHQ was found to be acceptable (sensitivity 69·6%, specificity 94·8%, misclassification rate 11·4%). The overall weighted prevalence rate was 18·0% for men and 33·3% for women. Both the CIS and the CHQ data are used as the morbidity indices to investigate the sociodemographic risk factors of MPM. A higher risk of MPM, which occupied 92% of the total morbidity, was found to be associated with women aged 35 and above, the unemployed men, and the lower socioeconomic status after linear modelling.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":12,"cited_by_count":117},"references":84,"networkCitations":12,"seed":false}
