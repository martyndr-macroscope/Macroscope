This study tested a biobehavioral model of binge-eating severity in which greater weight suppression links to reduced leptin, which links to reduced glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) release, which links to both decreased reward satiation and increased reward valuation, which link, respectively, to excessive food intake and loss of control while eating – the defining features of DSM-5 binge-eating episodes. Methods Women ( N = 399) who met DSM-5 criteria for bulimia nervosa or another eating disorder with binge eating ( n = 321) or had no lifetime eating disorder symptoms ( n = 78) participated in a multi-visit protocol, including structured clinical interviews, height, weight, weight history, percent body fat, fasting leptin, post-prandial GLP-1 response to a fixed meal, and self-report and behavioral assessments of food reward satiation ( ad lib meal) and food and nonfood reward valuation (progressive ratio tasks). Results A structural equation model (SEM) demonstrated excellent fit to data with significant pathways from greater weight suppression to lower leptin, to blunted GLP-1 response, to lower reward satiation, to larger eating/binge-eating episode size, with significant indirect paths through leptin, GLP-1, and reward satiation. SEM with paths via reward valuation to loss of control eating demonstrated inadequate fit. Conclusions Findings specifically link reduced GLP-1 response to severity of binge-episode size and support weight history assessment in eating disorders, DSM-5 over ICD-11 criteria for binge eating, and may inform future clinical trials of GLP-1 agonists for BN-S.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":61,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
