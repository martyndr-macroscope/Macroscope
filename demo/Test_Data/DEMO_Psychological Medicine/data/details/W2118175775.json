The method is also used to validate the primary screening instrument (in this case the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale – EPDS), and to estimate the effects of cofactors, such as maternal age, previous psychiatric history and social class.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":44},"references":25,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
