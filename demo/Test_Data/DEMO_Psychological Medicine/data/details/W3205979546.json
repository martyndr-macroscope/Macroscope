Methods Data were from a nationally representative cohort based on electronic health records from January 2013 to February 2021 ( N = 852 233), with an interrupted time series study design. For the primary analysis, the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on incident suicide attempts warranting in-patient hospital treatment was quantified by fitting a Poisson regression and modeling the relative risk (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Scenarios were forecast to predict attempted suicide rates at 10 months after social mitigation strategies. Fourteen sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results Despite the increasing trend in the unexposed interval, the interval exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic was statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.001) associated with a reduced RR of incident attempted suicide (RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.52–0.78). Consistent with the primary analysis, sensitivity analysis of sociodemographic groups and methodological factors were statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05). No effect modification was identified for COVID-19 lockdown intervals or COVID-19 illness status. All three forecast scenarios at 10 months projected a suicide attempt rate increase from 12.49 (7.42–21.01) to 21.38 (12.71–35.99). Conclusions The interval exposed to the protracted mass social trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a lower suicide attempt rate compared to the unexposed interval. However, this trend is likely to reverse 10 months after lifting social mitigation policies, underscoring the need for enhanced implementation of public health policy for suicide prevention.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":39},"references":54,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
