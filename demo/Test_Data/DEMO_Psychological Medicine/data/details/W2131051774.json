Pooling of data from the present and similar studies suggests that AD is not strongly associated with any particular HLA antigen, although there may be a weak association with HLA-A2, B15 and Cw3. In a family study of 34 patients with AD, secondary cases of AD were identified in 9·7% of the first-degree relatives, and cases of presenile dementia and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type were found to occur within individual families.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":15},"references":33,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
