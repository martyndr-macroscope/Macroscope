The key diagnostic features are acute, floridly psychotic symptoms with complete remission. Its use in a Paris hospital has been examined, and it appears that the term is declining in popularity. A case-controlled study indicated that the diagnosis is likely to be given to migrants on first admission. A re-diagnosis of case summaries indicated no particular correspondence of bouffée délirante to any one lCD category. However, the usefulness of having a special diagnostic term for psychosis with a good outcome is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":39},"references":7,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
