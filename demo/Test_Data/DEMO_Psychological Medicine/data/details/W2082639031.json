A simultaneous oral glucose tolerance test was carried out. The glucose response showed a low, flat curve with a delayed peak, and increased secretion of insulin and growth hormone occurred. As the gastric emptying rate proved to be normal the observed metabolic abnormalities are not due to the effect of heroin on the gastro-intestinal tract, but must be attributed to some other effect of chronic heroin administration.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":10},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
