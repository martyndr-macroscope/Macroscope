In the scaled GHQ-28, two of the scales were remarkably robust between the centres. The cross-correlation between the other two subscales, probably reflects the strength of the relationship between anxiety and somatic symptoms existing in different locations.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":385},"references":6,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
