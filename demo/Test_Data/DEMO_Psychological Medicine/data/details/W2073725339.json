Information regarding employment status, and events preceding onset of their complaint was also obtained. The two groups did not differ in terms of any of the personality dimensions evaluated, or in their self-reports of events prior to onset of their illness. The groups differed significantly with regards to marital status (a higher proportion of the torticollis patients were single) but not marital harmony. A significantly higher proportion of the torticollis patients were in the permanently sick category of employment status. Findings of previous studies evaluating personality in torticollis and in sufferers of other disabling physical conditions are considered, and the results are discussed in terms of the effects of disabling chronic physical disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":42},"references":42,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
