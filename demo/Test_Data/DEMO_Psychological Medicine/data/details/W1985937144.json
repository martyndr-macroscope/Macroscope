One third of these ‘old’ longstay patients (170) were discharged and resettled – and 81 elderly patients died. During the same three years 1971–3 a further 108 patients became (new) longstay; 57 remained at the end of the study. The discharged patients were neither readmitted unduly often, nor did they become destitute.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":6},"references":21,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
