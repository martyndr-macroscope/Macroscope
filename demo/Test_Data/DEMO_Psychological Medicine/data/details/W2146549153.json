The data suggested that psychiatric impairment measured by the General Health Questionnaire and distress measured by the Impact of Event Scale were relatively separate phenomena. Psychiatric impairment in these people appeared to be related more to their level of distress after the fires than to the severity of their exposure and losses.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":113},"references":35,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
