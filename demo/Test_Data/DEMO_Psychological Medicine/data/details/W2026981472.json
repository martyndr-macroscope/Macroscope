Each patient's needs for accommodation and employment were assessed as if immediate discharge from hospital were being contemplated. The results of the exercise emphasize the need for long-stay to permanent accommodation. The validity of this method of assessing community care requirements is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":14},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
