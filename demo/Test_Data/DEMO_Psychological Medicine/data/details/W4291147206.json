Group CPT has been shown to be less efficacious than individual CPT, however, evidence regarding real-world effectiveness is limited. Methods We conducted a retrospective, observational, comparative effectiveness study including veterans that received at least eight sessions of group CPT, individual CPT, or individual PE, and were discharged from PTSD residential treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs between 1 October 2015, and 30 September 2020. PTSD symptom severity was assessed with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and treatments delivered in a group (CPT) or individual (CPT or PE) setting were compared at discharge and 4-month post-discharge follow-up. Results Of 6735 veterans, 3888 [653 women (17%), median (IQR) age 45 (35–55) years] received individual and 2847 [206 women (7.2%), median (IQR) age 42 (34–54)] received group therapy. At discharge, improvement in PTSD severity was statistically greater among those treated individually (mean difference on the PCL-5, 2.55 (95% CI 1.61–3.49); p = &lt;0.001]. However, the difference was smaller than the minimal clinically important difference of 7.9 points. The groups did not differ significantly at 4-month follow-up [mean difference on the PCL-5, 0.37 (95% CI −0.86 to 1.60); p = 0.551]. Conclusion Group CPT was associated with a slightly smaller reduction of PTSD symptom severity than individual CPT or PE in veterans at the end of residential treatment. There were no differences at 4-month follow-up.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":7},"references":36,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
