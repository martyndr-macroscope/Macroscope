Rates of these behavioural pathologies have been calculated for 19 wards in the city, and correlated with data collected in the 1966 Census. Results show that the behavioural pathologies are strongly intercorrelated and are associated with in-migrant areas containing rooming houses of poor quality. These areas tend to be in the city centre. Rates of psychiatric illness, including diagnostic groups in different age and sex groups, have been calculated for 110 enumeration districts in the city, and these rates correlated with factor scores from the principal components analysis of 53 census variables. Complex patterning of the data has been demonstrated. The identification of small areas in the city with high rates of behavioural pathology in particular social settings is an important precursor of the establishment of special measures for prevention and treatment. An important area for future research is the establishment of causal patterns, and the investigation of the primary or secondary role of social conditions in the emergence of mental illness and other behavioural pathology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":63},"references":20,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
