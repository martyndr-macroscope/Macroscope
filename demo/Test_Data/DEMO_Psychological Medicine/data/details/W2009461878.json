No support was found for the DSM-III-R view correlating the severity of the stressor with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Distress post injury (high scores on the impact of event scale), indicative of difficulty with cognitive assimilation of the traumatic event, was found to be highly predictive of psychiatric morbidity and PTSD at 6 months.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":188},"references":27,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
