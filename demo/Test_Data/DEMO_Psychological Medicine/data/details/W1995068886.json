Ninety-two GPs from both areas participated in a one-day survey of their provision of psychiatric care, and this paper focuses on socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with specialist psychiatric referral. The one-day prevalence figure for GP referral to specialist psychiatric services was 7·3% (17·6/10000): the figures did not differ between the sexes or between the two areas. Whereas in North-Verona 49% of the patients referred were sent to the two local hospital-based public services and 51% to other agencies (mainly to private psychiatrists), in South-Verona 71% of referrals were to the community-based public service. Log-linear analysis showed that past psychiatric history, psychological presenting complaint, social problems and GPs' psychiatric diagnosis exerted positive joint main effects on GP referral to specialist psychiatric services, and that diagnosed organic illness had a negative effect in this regard. In the presence of a psychological complaint, a psychiatric diagnosis proved to be quite unimportant, so that those without a psychiatric diagnosis were just as likely to be referred as those with one. However, in the absence of a psychological complaint a GP diagnosis of depression greatly increased the risk of referral. Though the type of psychiatric service proved not to be an important determinant of GP referral to specialist psychiatric services it influenced the GPs' choice of referral agency.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":24},"references":41,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
