The correlation with the Hamilton Rating Scale is +0·87. At a cut-off level of 14–15 points 3% of patients and 7·5% of ‘Normals’ are misclassified. The mean scores for male and female patients do not differ significantly and the small positive correlation of score with age is of little practical significance. The limitations in this inventory are discussed but, despite them, it has practical value and merits further development.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":275},"references":10,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
