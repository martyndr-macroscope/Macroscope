Psychodynamic psychotherapy is one of the psychotherapies offered. Dynamic Interpersonal Therapy (DIT) is a psychodynamic and mentalization-based treatment for depression. 16 sessions are delivered over approximately 5 months. Neither DIT's effectiveness relative to low-intensity treatment (LIT), nor the feasibility of randomizing patients to psychodynamic or cognitive-behavioural treatments (CBT) in an IAPT setting has been demonstrated. Methods 147 patients were randomized in a 3:2:1 ratio to DIT ( n = 73), LIT (control intervention; n = 54) or CBT ( n = 20) in four IAPT treatment services in a combined superiority and feasibility design. Patients meeting criteria for major depressive disorder were assessed at baseline, mid-treatment (3 months) and post-treatment (6 months) using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and other self-rated questionnaire measures. Patients receiving DIT were also followed up 6 months post-completion. Results The DIT arm showed significantly lower HRSD-17 scores at the 6-month primary end-point compared with LIT ( d = 0.70). Significantly more DIT patients (51%) showed clinically significant change on the HRSD-17 compared with LIT (9%). The DIT and CBT arms showed equivalence on most outcomes. Results were similar with the BDI-II. DIT showed benefit across a range of secondary outcomes. Conclusions DIT delivered in a primary care setting is superior to LIT and can be appropriately compared with CBT in future RCTs.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":41},"references":55,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
