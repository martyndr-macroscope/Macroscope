The aim of the current study was to investigate to what degree family history (FH) of AUD is associated with cognitive functions. Methods Case-control cross-sectional study at an outpatient addiction research clinic. Treatment-seeking AUD patients ( n = 106) were compared to healthy controls (HC; n = 90), matched for age and sex. The HC group was further subdivided into AUD FH positive (FH+; n = 47) or negative (FH−; n = 39) based on the Family Tree Questionnaire. Participants underwent psychiatric and substance use assessments, completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and performed a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests assessing response inhibition, decision making, attention, working memory, and emotional recognition. Results Compared to HC, AUD patients exhibited elevated self-rated impulsivity ( p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.62), as well as significantly poorer response inhibition ( p = 0.001; d = 0.51), attention ( p = 0.021; d = 0.38) and information gathering in decision making ( p = 0.073; d = 0.34). Similar to AUD patients, FH+ individuals exhibited elevated self-rated impulsivity ( p = 0.096; d = 0.46), and in addition significantly worse future planning capacity ( p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.76) and prolonged emotional recognition response time ( p = 0.010; d = 0.60) compared to FH−, while no other significant differences were found between FH+ and FH−. Conclusions Elevated impulsivity, poor performance in future planning and emotional processing speed may be potential cognitive endophenotypes in AUD. These cognitive domains represent putative targets for prevention strategies and treatment of AUD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":20},"references":67,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
