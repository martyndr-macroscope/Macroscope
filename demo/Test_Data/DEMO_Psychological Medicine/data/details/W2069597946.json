Fourteen were head bangers, of whom two had cavum septum pellucidum. Clinical correlates of self-injury were the severity of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome symptoms and psychopathology, with special reference to obsessionality and hostility. We discuss an additional patient who died from a subdural haematoma as a result of head banging, and three who had permanent vision impairment from self inflicted eye injuries.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":172},"references":146,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
