The mental health of a migrant group is determined by factors relating to the society of origin, factors relating to the migration itself, and factors operating in the society of resettlement; and all three sets need to be considered if one seeks to reduce or merely to understand the level of mental disorder in any immigrant group. Illustrations from each set of factors are presented, with indications of whether they appear to have general relevance or be related to specific mental disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":215},"references":40,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
