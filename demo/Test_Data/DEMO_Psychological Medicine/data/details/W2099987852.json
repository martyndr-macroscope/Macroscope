For example, criteria for diagnosis of these conditions include a diminished ability to concentrate and indecisiveness. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated wide-ranging cognitive deficits in depression (for example Elliott et al . 1996; Purcell et al . 1997; Murphy et al . 2003) and mania (Goldberg et al . 1993; Murphy et al . 1999, 2001; Sweeney et al . 2000). These include deficits in early information processing (Tsourtos et al . 2002), recollection memory (MacQueen et al . 2002) and planning (Elliott et al . 1996) as well as affective biases (Murphy et al . 1999) and abnormal responses to negative feedback (Elliott et al . 1996, 1997; Murphy et al . 2003). Some residual deficits are also evident in a proportion of remitted subjects, even when controlling for mood (for example, Clark et al . 2002).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":15,"cited_by_count":111},"references":89,"networkCitations":15,"seed":false}
