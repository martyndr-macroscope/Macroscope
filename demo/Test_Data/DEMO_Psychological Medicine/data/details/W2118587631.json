In addition, the genes for the dopamine D2 receptor and for tyrosinase both map to chromosome 11q. Three 11q DNA markers were used to investigate 23 pedigrees containing multiple cases of schizophrenia. Strongly negative lod scores were obtained, providing evidence against linkage over a 70 cM region which included both translocation sites and both candidate genes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":19},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
