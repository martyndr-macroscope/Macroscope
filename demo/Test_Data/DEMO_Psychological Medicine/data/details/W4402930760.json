It is therefore imperative that we improve our ability to predict the nature of the acute psychedelic experience to improve safety and optimize potential therapeutic outcomes. This study sought to validate the ‘Imperial Psychedelic Predictor Scale’ (IPPS), a short, widely applicable, prospective measure intended to be predictive of salient dimensions of the psychedelic experience. Methods Using four independent datasets in which the IPPS was completed prospectively – two online surveys of ‘naturalistic’ use ( N = 741, N = 836) and two controlled administration datasets ( N = 30, N = 28) – we conducted factor analysis, regression, and correlation analyses to assess the construct, predictive, and convergent validity of the IPPS. Results Our approach produced a 9-item scale with good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.8) containing three factors: set, rapport, and intention. The IPPS was significantly predictive of ‘mystical’, ‘challenging’, and ‘emotional breakthrough’ experiences. In a controlled administration dataset ( N = 28), multiple regression found set and rapport explaining 40% of variance in mystical experience, and simple regression found set explained 16% of variance in challenging experience. In another ( N = 30), rapport was related to emotional breakthrough explaining 9% of variance. Conclusions Together, these data suggest that the IPPS is predictive of relevant acute features of the psychedelic experience in a broad range of contexts. We hope that this brief 9-item scale will be widely adopted for improved knowledge of psychedelic preparedness in controlled settings and beyond.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":1,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
