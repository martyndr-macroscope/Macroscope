Eleven patients undergoing diagnostic cystoscopy served as controls to examine the acute effect of anaesthesia. Total and free plasma tryptophan concentrations in the depressed patients were not significantly different from control values and were not changed by the course of ECT. Free plasma tryptophan varied considerably within individual patients. Total plasma tryptophan was reduced acutely by ECT/anaesthesia in the depressed patients ( P &lt; 0·05) and by anaesthesia in the cystoscopy controls ( P &lt; 0·01). Free plasma tryptophan was not significantly altered. This reduction in total plasma tryptophan could be secondary to an effect of thiopentone on albumin binding of tryptophan.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":7},"references":20,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
