The present study aimed at the investigation of an experimental referral procedure by means of a randomized controlled study. Non-compliant patients in the experimental group were visited in their homes by a community nurse in order to assess reasons for non-compliance and to motivate patients to comply with referral. One year after their suicide attempt patients were visited in their homes in order to assess repetition of suicidal behaviour. Uni-and multi-variate analyses showed a significant beneficial effect of the experimental procedure on compliance with referral. A near-significant effect of the experimental procedure on the rate of repetition of suicidal behaviour was found.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":147},"references":26,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
