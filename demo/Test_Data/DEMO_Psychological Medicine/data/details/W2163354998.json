Mental illness, financial and housing problems were the three problems most frequently identified by the social workers. At inception 72 (51%) of the subjects were PSE cases (ID &gt; 5) and 25% at follow-up. The type of social work help offered to cases and non-cases did not differ. Social and clinical data collected at inception and follow-up were used to classify (using discriminant function analysis) caseness at inception and follow-up and clinical change. Caseness at inception (82% of subjects were correctly classified) was associated with depression, subjective social problems and poverty. Caseness at follow-up (74% correctly classified) was associated with poor coping abilities at inception and clinical features of depression. Clinical change (worsening) (71% correctly classified) was associated with seeing a Community Psychiatric Nurse and poor coping abilities at inception. The ability to classify correctly cases and change was enhanced when additional data from follow-up interviews were used. In the PSE cases, only clinical worsening was correctly classified by a high GHQ score at inception, age and poor coping abilities. The last result is similar to that obtained in general practice by Mann et al. (1981).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":14},"references":15,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
