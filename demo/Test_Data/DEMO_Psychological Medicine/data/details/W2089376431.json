Four potential sources of artefact were considered: (1) the reliability of the procedure for investigating suspected suicides; (2) coding by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys; (3) changes in the law; (4) High Court decisions on suicide. None of these can explain the large observed fluctuations in the suicide rate.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":18},"references":2,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
