Anxiety disorder patients do not consume toxic amounts of caffeine. However, increased sensitivity to caffeine in these patients has been suggested as contributing to their symptoms. Six cases of anxiety disorder are presented who improved with only caffeine abstention, and remained well for at least a six-month follow-up period.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":61},"references":15,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
