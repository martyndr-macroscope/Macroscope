The results suggest a high rate of psychiatric disturbance. The highest rate of cognitive disturbance detected by the MMS was found in patients with Parkinson's disease. The highest rates of emotional disturbance indicated by GHQ scores were found in patients with myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis. MMS scores but not GHQ scores were related to standardtests of cognition, the diagnosis of cerebral pathology, and CAT scan abnormality. The results also demonstrate that the GHQ does not adequately detect patients with cognitive impairment. It is concluded that in populations at high risk for cognitive impairment a tandem screening procedure utilizing tests for both cognitive and emotional disorders is needed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":95},"references":28,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
