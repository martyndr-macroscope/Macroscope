The majority of the tests showed impaired performance during depression with improvement after recovery, and also differences between the two age-groups in both the depressed and recovered phases. However, the older subjects were not more severely affected by depression than the younger subjects. The pattern of impairment associated with depression was different to that associated with older age: depression affected performance on more ‘complex tasks’, whereas age was associated particularly with slowing on timed tests. This study did not suggest that the impairment from baseline due to depression is greater in the elderly than in younger subjects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":108},"references":69,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
