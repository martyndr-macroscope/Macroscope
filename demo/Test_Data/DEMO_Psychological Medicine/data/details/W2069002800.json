Dextroamphetamine, given as a single oral 20 mg dose, fulfils the criteria for such a model in that there are very close similarities between the changes which occur after dextroamphetamine and those which have been observed in mania in terms of subjective experience, physiological and endocrine changes, and response to pharmacological agents.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":149},"references":61,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
