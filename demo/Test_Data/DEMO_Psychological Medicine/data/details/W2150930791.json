There was no significant difference between the patient groups or between these and patients with neurological disease. These findings suggest a reduced neuronal activity in the 5-hydroxytryptaminergic system in some depressed patients rather than an absolute deficiency of tryptophan-5-hydroxylase. The synthesis of 5-HIAA in response to tryptophan varied with age.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":51},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
