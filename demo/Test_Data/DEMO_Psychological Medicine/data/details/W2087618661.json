The total group of depressed patients had significantly higher urinary outputs of norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolite normetanephrine (NM), and significantly lower urinary outputs of the dopamine metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), than controls. Patients who met DSM-III criteria for a major depressive episode with melancholia ( N = 8) had significantly higher urinary outputs of normetanephrine than controls, whereas patients with a major depressive episode without melancholia ( N = 7) and dysthymic disorder patients ( N = 8) had levels comparable with controls. We postulate that the higher urinary outputs of norepinephrine and its metabolite, normetanephrine, reflect dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system in depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":50},"references":30,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
