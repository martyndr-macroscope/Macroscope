We examined the prevalence, comorbidity, time–order associations with mental disorders, and sex differences in sporadic and repetitive NSSI among emerging adults. Methods We used survey data from n = 72,288 first-year college students as part of the World Mental Health-International College Student Survey Initiative (WMH-ICS) to explore time–order associations between onset of NSSI and mental disorders, based on retrospective age-of-onset reports using discrete-time survival models. We distinguished between sporadic (1–5 lifetime episodes) and repetitive (≥6 lifetime episodes) NSSI in relation to DSM-5 mood, anxiety, and externalizing disorders. Results We estimated a lifetime NSSI rate of 24.5%, with approximately half reporting sporadic NSSI and half repetitive NSSI. The time–order associations between onset of NSSI and mental disorders were bidirectional, but mental disorders were stronger predictors of the onset of NSSI (median RR = 1.94) than vice versa (median RR = 1.58). These associations were stronger among individuals engaging in repetitive rather than sporadic NSSI. While associations between NSSI and mental disorders generally did not differ by sex, repetitive NSSI was a stronger predictor for the onset of subsequent substance use disorders among females compared to males. Most mental disorders marginally increased the risk for persistent repetitive NSSI (median RR = 1.23). Conclusions Our findings offer unique insights into the temporal order between NSSI and mental disorders. Further work exploring the mechanism underlying these associations will pave the way for early identification and intervention of both NSSI and mental disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":1},"references":62,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
