An age matched non-pregnant control group of women ( N = 25) was also studied. The number B max ) of α 2 -adrenoceptors was elevated antepartum but fell to control values on the tenth post-partum day. At three and six months post-partum, however, α 2 -adrenoceptor B max was again increased. Women who developed maternity blues ( N = 59) had significantly more platelet α 2 -adrenoceptors than those who did not ( N = 49) at both ten and twenty days post-partum. In addition their α 2 -adrenoceptor B max was greater than controls at all time points measured except the tenth post-partum day. In contrast, the α 2 -adrenoceptor B max of women without the blues did not differ from controls at any stage. It is suggested that women who develop maternity blues may have a relatively enduring abnormality in α 2 -adrenoceptor sensitivity which is associated with psychological symptoms when concentrations of circulating sex-steroids suddenly change.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":14},"references":40,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
