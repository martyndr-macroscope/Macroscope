The University agreed to the establishment of a new Chair of Neuroscience to accompany this academic initiative and to which Professor Brian Anderton was appointed in 1989. In 1989, a new Lecturer in Molecular Biology, Dr John Powell, was appointed as well as a Clinical Senior Lecturer jointly with the Department of Psychiatry, Dr Robert Kerwin; this latter post was a new post under the UFC New Clinical Appointments Scheme. These changes have led to a strengthening of the molecular and cellular neurobiological interests of this new department and will influence the future academic aims of the Department of Neuroscience and Institute of Psychiatry as a whole.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":19,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
