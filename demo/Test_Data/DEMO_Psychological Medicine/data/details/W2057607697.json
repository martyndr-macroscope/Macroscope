This supports the hypothesis that, in professional staff, an important determinant of helping is optimism arising from attributions of a patient's problems. The influence of affective judgements, as emphasized in Weiner's (1986) theory of helping behaviour, is not supported.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":77},"references":38,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
