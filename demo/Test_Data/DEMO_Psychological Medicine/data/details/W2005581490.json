Comparison of these groups in terms of number of treatments, duration of treatment, or incidence of treatment failure, showed that the bilateral placements were superior to the unilateral; comparison of Hamilton, Montgomery–Åsberg, and visual analogue scale scores showed that the bifrontal placement was superior to both bitemporal and unilateral treatment. Bitemporal treatment showed therapeutic results intermediate between BF and RU. Because BF ECT causes fewer cognitive side effects than either RU or BT, and is independently more effective, it should be considered as the first choice of electrode position in ECT.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":152},"references":35,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
