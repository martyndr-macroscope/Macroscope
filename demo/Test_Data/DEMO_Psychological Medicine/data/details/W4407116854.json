Given that schizophrenia (SZ) is characterized by marked abnormalities in oscillatory cortical activity as well as changes in autonomic function, the present study aimed to identify mechanisms by which central and autonomic nervous system deficits may be related. We evaluated phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) as a physiological mechanism through which autonomic nervous system (ANS) and central nervous system (CNS) activity are integrated and that may be disrupted in SZ. Methods PAC was measured between high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) as an index of parasympathetic activity and electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations in 36 individuals with first-episode SZ and 38 healthy comparison participants at rest. Results HRV-EEG coupling was lower in SZ in the alpha and theta bands, and HRV-EEG coupling uniquely predicted group membership, whereas HRV and EEG power alone did not. HRV-EEG coupling in the alpha band correlated with measures of sustained attention in SZ. Granger causality analyses indicated a stronger heart-to-brain effect than brain-to-heart effect, consistent across groups. Conclusions Lower HRV-EEG coupling provides evidence of deficient autonomic regulation of cortical activity in SZ, suggesting that patterns of dysconnectivity observed in brain networks extend to brain–body interactions. Deficient ANS–CNS integration in SZ may foster a breakdown in the spatiotemporal organization of cortical activity, which may contribute to core cognitive impairments in SZ such as dysregulated attention. These findings encourage pursuit of therapies targeting autonomic function for the treatment of SZ.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":61,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
