A behavioural approach to its treatment is described. This focuses on increasing control over eating, eliminating food avoidance and changing maladaptive attitudes. Preliminary findings are promising, with improvement appearing to be maintained. Components of the treatment may benefit patients who simply complain of overeating.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":425},"references":15,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
