In this study, we sought to determine the association between weight change over 4 years and depression risk among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods This population-based retrospective cohort study from the National Health Insurance Services of Korea included 1 111 345 patients with type 2 diabetes who were divided into groups according to body weight change over 4 years. Body weight changes were compared with the preceding 4-year period (2005–2008). Depression was defined according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision code for depression (F32 and F33) on one or more inpatient or outpatient claims. Results During a median follow-up of 7.4 years, 244 081 cases of depression were identified. We observed a U-shaped association between body weight change and depression risk with a higher risk among both groups of weight loss (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17, 95% CI 1.15–1.19 for ⩾ −10%; HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06–1.08 for −10 to −5%) and weight gain (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04–1.08 for ⩾10%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.04 for 5–10%) compared with the stable weight group (−5 to 5%). Conclusions A U-shaped association between body weight change and depression risk was observed in this large nationwide cohort study. Our study suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes and weight change, either gain or loss, could be considered a high-risk group for depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":46,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
