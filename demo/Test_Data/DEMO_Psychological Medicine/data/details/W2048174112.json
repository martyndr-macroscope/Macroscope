Crude mortality rates were 3·3% and 3·1% in the anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa groups respectively. Standardized rates demonstrated a six-fold increase in mortality in the anorexia nervosa group. The most common cause of death in this group was found to be suicide, with the risk of death remaining high for at least eight years after initial assessment. Specific associations of increased mortality were: being in the lowest weight group at the time of presentation, and having recurrent hospital admissions for eating problems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":185},"references":12,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
