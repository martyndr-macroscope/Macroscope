We report on a longitudinal study of 153 general practice patients beginning a new course of psychotropic drug treatment and characterized by extensive physical and psychological morbidity. About 1 in 5 were still receiving psychotropic drugs 6 months later and this prolonged treatment was associated with increased age, previous psychotropic drug-use, higher levels of psychological morbidity at the inception of treatment and, for the women only, social problems as perceived by the general practitioners.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":69},"references":22,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
