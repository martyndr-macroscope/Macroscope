Estimates are given for the likely occupancy at 1 January 1982, for short and medium stay (under one year), and long-stay (one year or more) beds. Three methods of projecting the accumulation of new long-stay patients are described and discussed. The total occupancy by 1982 is likely to be about 2·3 beds/1,000 total population, about 1·7/1,000 for long-stay patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":32},"references":18,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
