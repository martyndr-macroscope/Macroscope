These levels were reassessed one month and ten months after the pilgrims had returned. There was a statistically significant decrease in anxiety and depression which was sustained. The possible reasons for these findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":38},"references":6,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
