It can refer either to self-recognized hallucinations (exterocepted or interocepted) or to introspected images of great vividness and spontaneity. It is argued that the phenomena to which the two definitions refer might best be distinguished as perceived and imaged pseudo-hallucinations.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":52},"references":23,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
