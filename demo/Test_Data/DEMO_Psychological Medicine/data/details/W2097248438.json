Method The Reading the Mind in the Eyes task, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and a computerized pictorial (angry and neutral faces) Stroop task were administered to 190 women [50 with AN, 50 with BN and 90 healthy controls (HCs)]. Results Those with an ED showed attentional biases to faces in general (medium effect), but specifically to angry faces over neutral faces (large effect) compared to HCs. The ED group also reported significantly higher emotion regulation difficulties (large effect) than HCs. There was a small difference between the ED and HC groups for the emotion recognition task (small-medium effect), particularly in the restricting AN (RAN) group. Depression and attentional bias to faces significantly predicted emotion regulation difficulties in a regression model. Conclusions The data provide support for conceptualizations of EDs that emphasize the role of emotional functioning in the development and maintenance of EDs. Further research will concentrate on exploring whether these findings are state or trait features of EDs.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":477},"references":74,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
