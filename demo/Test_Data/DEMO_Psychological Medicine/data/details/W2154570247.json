The chief finding was that subjects with a lifetime history of panic disorder–agoraphobia (PD–Ag) returned statistically higher scores on a retrospective measure of early separation anxiety compared to subjects with either generalized anxiety or other phobic disorders, a result which was not accounted for by differences in neuroticism or General Health Questionnaire scores. Although limited by its retrospective design and the problem of co-morbidity in subclassifying the anxiety disorders, the present study does provide added support for the hypothesis – endorsed by DSM-III-R – that there is a developmental link between early separation anxiety and panic disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":52},"references":30,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
