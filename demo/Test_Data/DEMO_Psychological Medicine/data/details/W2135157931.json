The study was designed to reduce potential sources of bias and the approach included random sampling of a general practice population; independent assessments of the physical and psychiatric states using objective methods and strict criteria for diagnosis; and the use of a control group. The results suggest that the hypothesis is confirmed and furthermore that ‘clustering’ of both types of disorder occurred in some individuals.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":16,"cited_by_count":150},"references":21,"networkCitations":16,"seed":false}
