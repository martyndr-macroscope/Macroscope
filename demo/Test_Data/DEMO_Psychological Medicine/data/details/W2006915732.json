Drug effects on tests, psychophysiological measures, and self-ratings of mood were studied in normal subjects and related to plasma levels of the drug and psychasthenic personality traits. Significant sedative effects were obtained in some self-rating variables. The combined effect in the objective psychological tests was significantly correlated (rank) to the plasma level in the higher dose experiment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":61},"references":27,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
