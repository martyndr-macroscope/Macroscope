Researchers have proposed five theories: dispositional negative emotionality (neuroticism), impulsive responsivity to emotions (impulsivity), thought dysfunction, low cognitive functioning, and impairment. These theories have primarily been inferred from patterns of loadings of diagnoses on p -factors with different sets of diagnoses included in different studies. Researchers who have directly examined these theories of p have examined a subset of the theories in any single sample, limiting the ability to compare the size of their associations with a p -factor. Methods In a sample of adults ( N = 1833, M age = 34.20, 54.4% female, 53.3% white) who completed diagnostic assessments, self-report measures, and cognitive tests, we evaluated statistical p -factor structures across modeling approaches and compared the strength of associations among the p -factor and indicators of each of these five theories. Results We found consistent evidence of the p -factor's unidimensionality across one-factor and bifactor models. The p -factor was most strongly and similarly associated with neuroticism ( r = .88), impairment ( r = .88), and impulsivity ( r = .87), χ 2 (1)s &lt; .15, p s &gt; .70, and less strongly associated with thought dysfunction ( r = .78), χ 2 (1)s &gt; 3.92, p s &lt; .05, and cognitive functioning ( r = −.25), χ 2 (1)s &gt; 189.56, p s &lt; .01. Conclusions We discuss a tripartite definition of p that involves the transaction of impulsive responses to frequent negative emotions leading to impairment that extends and synthesizes previous theories of psychopathology.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":38},"references":69,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
