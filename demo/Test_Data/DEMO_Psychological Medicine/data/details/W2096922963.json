Scores obtained using the instrument were compared with those obtained from the investigator-based interview, the Present State Examination, in two samples of patients: a sample of patients with chronic physical disease (diabetes mellitus) and a sample of patients with bulimia nervosa. There was good agreement between the two methods of measurement in both samples, suggesting that the SCL-90R performs well in the assessment of neurotic symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":143},"references":23,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
