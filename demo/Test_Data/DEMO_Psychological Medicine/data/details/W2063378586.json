This model proposes that, unlike the common bipolar view of depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through depression, to mania. Simple reaction time measures did not confirm this hypothesis. However, results of more complex psychomotor performance did provide some confirmation, and, also, provided evidence of a ‘central processing’ deficit in both manic and depressed subjects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
