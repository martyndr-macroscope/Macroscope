While neural correlates of reward-seeking and loss-avoidance have been examined in PSZ, neural correlates of uncertainty-driven exploration have not. Understanding neural correlates of uncertainty-driven exploration is an important next step that could reveal insights to how this mechanism of cognitive and negative symptoms manifest at a neural level. Methods We acquired fMRI data from 29 PSZ and 36 controls performing the Temporal Utility Integration decision-making task. Computational analyses estimated parameters corresponding to learning rates for both positive and negative reward prediction errors (RPEs) and the degree to which participates relied on representations of relative uncertainty. Trial-wise estimates of expected value, certainty, and RPEs were generated to model fMRI data. Results Behaviorally, PSZ demonstrated reduced reward-seeking behavior compared to controls, and negative symptoms were positively correlated with loss-avoidance behavior. This finding of a bias toward loss avoidance learning in PSZ is consistent with previous work. Surprisingly, neither behavioral measures of exploration nor neural correlates of uncertainty in the rlPFC differed significantly between groups. However, we showed that trial-wise estimates of relative uncertainty in the rlPFC distinguished participants who engaged in exploratory behavior from those who did not. rlPFC activation was positively associated with intellectual function. Conclusions These results further elucidate the nature of reinforcement learning and decision-making in PSZ and healthy volunteers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":31,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
