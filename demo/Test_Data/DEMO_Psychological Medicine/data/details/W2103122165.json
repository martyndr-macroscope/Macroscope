We describe the epidemiology of suicide pacts in England and Wales and assess the health, circumstances and motivation of those who died in pacts; the first such account for 35 years. Methods. We have analysed the death certificates, coroners' records and medical notes of all people who died in suicide pacts in England and Wales between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 1992. Results. The 124 suicides in 62 pacts accounted for 0·6% of all suicides giving a rate of 0·6 per million. The average age was 56 years. Poisoning by car exhaust or medicines caused 95% of deaths, both members of each pair using the same method. Forty-eight pacts were between married couples, five between blood relatives. Mental disorder was present in half and medical illness in one-third. Motives were avoiding loss of a partner from ill-health in 26 pacts, euthanasia in nine, thwarted love in four. Conclusions. The findings are similar to those of 35 years ago except the incidence of pacts is less. Improved management of illness might avoid some pacts especially when partners in an enduring, affectionate relationship, with few social ties, are both ill.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":44},"references":8,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
