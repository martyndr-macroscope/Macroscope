To augment the family history data the Leyton Obsessional Inventory was completed by a subset of 10 patients and by their 20 parents. Although as a group parents showed lower Leyton Obsessional Inventory symptom scores than their obsessional offspring, 3 parents who had not been identified by family history were distinguished by high symptom scores in the absence of significant resistance or interference.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":77},"references":29,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
