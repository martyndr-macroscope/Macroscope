The daily excretion of the depressed patients increased during the period of treatment and recovery from the illness. Treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant caused a greater increase than electroconvulsive treatment (ECT). There was no difference between the mean plasma c-AMP concentration of the depressed and euthymic groups. The mean CSF c-AMP concentration was not different from the mean plasma c-AMP concentration in 12 patients with severe depression. There was no direct correlation between the CSF and plasma concentrations within patients. It was concluded that there may be a reversible disturbance in the renal metabolism of c-AMP in patients with severe depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":36,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
