This region is of interest because several families have been reported in which balanced translocations involving 11q apparently co-segregate with psychotic illness. In addition, the dopamine D 2 receptor, porphobilinogen deaminase, and tyrosinase genes map within the region studied and may be aetiologically involved in schizophrenia. We have primarily analysed genotypic data by the LOD score method using a range of single gene models. In order to minimize error due to mis-specification of genetic parameters we have analysed data from markers at candidate gene loci by the non-parametric extended sib-pair method in addition to the LOD score method. Our results suggest that most of the region can be excluded from containing a gene of major effect in the aetiology of this disease.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":60},"references":61,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
