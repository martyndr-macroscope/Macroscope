M. Carstairs. Within a year of its formation it moved from London to Edinburgh where it has continued since, functioning in close collaboration with the Edinburgh University Department of Psychiatry. In April 1971 it was reconstituted under the same name and under the direction of the former assistant director, Dr. N. Kreitman. Its activities have been directed throughout primarily to the neuroses, personality disorders, and forms of abnormal behaviour such as ‘attempted suicide’ rather than to the psychoses or mental defect. The scientific staff currently number nine whole-time and two part-time workers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":30,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
