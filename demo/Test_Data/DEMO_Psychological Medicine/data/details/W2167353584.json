Although returns to the Department of Health and Social Security during this period indicated that a very low proportion of clients were physically or mentally ill, it is clear that these figures greatly underestimate the extent of illness present. While social workers operating outside hospital and general practice attachments have been shown to have little contact with medical staff, in this study high proportions of their clients were ill and their social problems were often associated with their illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":9},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
