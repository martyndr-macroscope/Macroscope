To provide much-needed insight into FD etiology, we evaluated FD and ID familial coaggregation and shared familiality. Methods Lifelines is a three-generation cohort study, which assessed three FDs (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS], irritable bowel syndrome [IBS], and fibromyalgia [FM]) and six IDs (major depressive disorder [MDD], dysthymia [DYS], generalized anxiety disorder [GAD], agoraphobia [AGPH], social phobia [SPH], and panic disorder [PD]) according to diagnostic criteria. Based on 153,803 individuals, including 90,397 with a first-degree relative in Lifelines, we calculated recurrence risk ratios (λ R s) and tetrachoric correlations to evaluate familial aggregation and coaggregation of these disorders in first-degree relatives. We then estimated their familiality and familial correlations. Results Familial aggregation was observed across disorders, with λ R ranging from 1.45 to 2.23 within disorders and from 1.17 to 1.94 across disorders. Familiality estimates ranged from 22% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16–29) for IBS to 42% (95% CI: 33–50) for ME/CFS. Familial correlations ranged from +0.37 (95% CI: 0.24–0.51) between FM and AGPH to +0.97 (95% CI: 0.80–1) between ME/CFS and FM. The highest familial correlation between an ID and FD was +0.83 (95% CI: 0.66–0.99) for MDD and ME/CFS. Conclusions There is a clear familial component to FDs, which is partially shared with IDs. This suggests that IDs and FDs share both genetic and family-environmental risk factors. Of the FDs, ME/CFS is most closely related to IDs.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":1},"references":77,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
