In 86 cases symptomatology had been inadequate for the patients to enter the functional psychosis study, and in 75 cases this was because the symptoms were partial or transient. These patients were compared at follow-up with those who fulfilled operational criteria for schizophrenic, affective or schizoaffective psychoses. Differences between the ‘partial’ cases and those fulfilling specific diagnostic criteria were few, but the transient cases fared significantly better. Although the transient illnesses were recurrent, at follow-up at 2·5 years they appeared to have a good outcome in terms of social variables and symptomatology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":14},"references":32,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
