The evidence suggests that the prevalence of major depression, substance abuse and offending behaviour, as well as the incidence of suicide, is increasing in adolescent populations, particularly among males. There are also indications that problem behaviours among younger children are becoming more common. There is no evidence of a deterioration in the adjustment of the pre-school population.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":50},"references":92,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
