Prolonged fatigue syndromes have been proposed as prevalent and disabling forms of distress that occur independently of conventional notions of anxiety and depression. Methods. To investigate the genetic and environmental antecedents of common forms of psychological and somatic distress, we measured fatigue, anxiety, depression and psychological distress in 1004 normal adult twin pairs (533 monozygotic (MZ), 471 dizygotic (DZ)) over 50 years of age. Results. Familial aggregation of psychological distress, anxiety and fatigue appeared to be due largely to additive genetic factors (MZ[ratio ]DZ ratios of 2·12–2·69). The phenotypic correlations between the psychological measures (distress, anxiety and depression) were moderate (0·67–0·79) and higher than that between fatigue and psychological distress (0·38). Multivariate genetic modelling revealed a common genetic factor contributing to the development of all the observed phenotypes (though most strongly for the psychological forms), a second independent genetic factor also influenced anxiety and depression and a third independent genetic factor made a major contribution to fatigue alone. In total, 44% (95% CI 25–60%) of the genetic variance for fatigue was not shared by the other forms of distress. Similarly, the environmental factor determining psychological distress made negligible contributions to fatigue, which was underpinned largely by its own independent environmental factor. Conclusion. This study supports the aetiological independence of prolonged fatigue and, therefore, argues strongly for its inclusion in classification systems in psychiatry.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":118},"references":30,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
