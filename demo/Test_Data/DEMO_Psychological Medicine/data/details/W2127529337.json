Patient expectancy is an important influence on clinical outcome in the treatment of depression and may explain this finding. The results are reported from a pilot RCT studying expectancy and depression outcome in placebo-controlled versus comparator treatment conditions. Method Out-patients aged 18–65 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) were enrolled in this 8-week RCT. Subjects were randomized to placebo-controlled (escitalopram or placebo) or comparator (escitalopram or citalopram) administration of antidepressant medication. Subjects reported their expected likelihood and magnitude of depression improvement before and after randomization using questions from the Credibility and Expectancy Scale (CES). A regressed change model of post-randomization expectancy of improvement was fit to the data to determine whether subjects in the comparator group reported greater expectancies of improvement than subjects in the placebo-controlled group. Results Twenty subjects with mean age 56.5±11.7 years, a baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score of 24.2±5.3, baseline Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score of 24.9±6.4 and baseline Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) – Severity score of 4.0±0.3 were enrolled in the study. Adjusting for other factors, the effect of group assignment on expected magnitude of improvement was significant and large (effect size 1.5). No group differences in expected likelihood of improvement were found. Conclusions Randomization to comparator versus placebo-controlled administration of antidepressant medication produced greater expectancies of how much patients would improve during the trial. This expectancy difference may explain the higher response and remission rates that are observed in comparator versus placebo-controlled trials.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":24},"references":33,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
