The validity of the modified GHQ was proved to be greater than that of the original, with a very high sensitivity and specificity. The Chinese version of the CIS was found to be feasible for community study in Taiwan. The total prevalence rate of all mental disorders was 26·0%, with a higher morbidity among females.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":56},"references":32,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
