Findings depended on advances in methodology. First, came development of a life events questionnaire and a scaling of their stress magnitude (Holmes &amp; Rahe, 1967); then, replacement by more reliable and valid interview methods and better ways of distinguishing major and minor events (Brown &amp; Harris, 1978; Paykel, 1996).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":22,"cited_by_count":24},"references":37,"networkCitations":22,"seed":false}
