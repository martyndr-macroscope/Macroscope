However, the interactions between these factors are poorly understood. Methods We examined associations between SUD polygenic scores (PGSs), ACEs, and the initiation of use and severity of alcohol (AUD), opioid use disorder (OUD), and cannabis use disorder (CanUD) in 10,275 individuals (43.5% female, 47.2% African-like ancestry [AFR], and 52.8% European-like ancestry [EUR]). ACEs and SUD severity were modeled as latent factors. We conducted logistic and linear regressions within ancestry groups to examine the associations of ACEs, PGS, and their interaction with substance use initiation and SUD severity. Results All three SUD PGS were associated with ACEs in EUR individuals, indicating a gene–environment correlation. Among EUR individuals, only the CanUD PGS was associated with initiating use, whereas ACEs were associated with initiating use of all three substances in both ancestry groups. Additionally, a negative gene-by-environment interaction was identified for opioid initiation in EUR individuals. ACEs were associated with all three SUD severity latent factors in EUR individuals and with AUD and CanUD severity in AFR individuals. PGS were associated with AUD severity in both ancestry groups and with CanUD severity in AFR individuals. Gene-by-environment interactions were identified for AUD and CanUD severity among EUR individuals. Conclusions Findings highlight the roles of ACEs and polygenic risk in substance use initiation and SUD severity. Gene-by-environment interactions implicate ACEs as moderators of genetic susceptibility, reinforcing the importance of considering both genetic and environmental influences on SUD risk.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":51,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
