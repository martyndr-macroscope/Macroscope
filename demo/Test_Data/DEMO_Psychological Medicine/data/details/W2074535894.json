Frequent coping mechanisms included changes in activity, interpersonal contact, manipulations of physiological arousal, and attentional control. A high risk of suicide was noted. Coping behaviour appeared somewhat independent of clinical and sociodemographic variables. Successful coping appeared to result from systematic application of widely used coping strategies. The implications for the clinical management of patients with persistent auditory hallucinations are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":288},"references":43,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
