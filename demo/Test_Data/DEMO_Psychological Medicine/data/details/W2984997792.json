A previous population-based taxometric study reported that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4 th Edition (DSM-IV) intermittent explosive disorder (IED) belongs to its own discrete class (taxon) rather than existing along a continuum. Methods This study sought to extend previous population-based findings in a clinical research sample of adults with DSM-5 IED ( n = 346), adults with non-aggressive DSM-5 disorders ( n = 293), and adults without any DSM-5 disorder ( n = 174), using standardized assessments of DSM-5 diagnoses, aggression, and other related measures not available in past studies. Results Analyses revealed a taxonic latent structure that overlapped with the DSM-5 diagnosis of IED. Within the sample, taxon group members had higher scores on a variety of measures of psychopathology than did the complement members of the sample. Comorbidity of other diagnoses with IED did not affect these results. Conclusion These findings support the proposition that DSM-5 IED represents a distinct behavioral disorder rather than the severe end of an aggressive behavior continuum.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":61,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
