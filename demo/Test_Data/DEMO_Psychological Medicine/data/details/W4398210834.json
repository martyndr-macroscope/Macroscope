Therefore, this study evaluates person-specific and pooled prediction models for binge eating (BE), alcohol use, and binge drinking (BD) in daily life, and identifies the most important predictors. Methods A total of 120 patients (BN: 50; AUD: 51; BN/AUD: 19) participated in an experience sampling study, where over a period of 12 months they reported on their eating and drinking behaviors as well as on several other emotional, behavioral, and contextual factors in daily life. The study had a burst-measurement design, where assessments occurred eight times a day on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays in seven bursts of three weeks. Afterwards, person-specific and pooled models were fit with elastic net regularized regression and evaluated with cross-validation. From these models, the variables with the 10% highest estimates were identified. Results The person-specific models had a median AUC of 0.61, 0.80, and 0.85 for BE, alcohol use, and BD respectively, while the pooled models had a median AUC of 0.70, 0.90, and 0.93. The most important predictors across the behaviors were craving and time of day. However, predictors concerning social context and affect differed among BE, alcohol use, and BD. Conclusions Pooled models outperformed person-specific models and the models for alcohol use and BD outperformed those for BE. Future studies should explore how the performance of these models can be improved and how they can be used to deliver interventions in daily life.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":5},"references":66,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
