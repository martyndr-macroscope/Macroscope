Method Searches on Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science databases were conducted in November 2006 and subsequently updated in September 2007. Each search was conducted in two steps: (1) neuropsychological tasks measuring central coherence and (2) words related to cognitive functioning in eating disorders. Data were summarized in a meta-analysis if the number of studies for a given test was &gt;5. Results Data were extracted from 16 studies. Meta-analyses were conducted for four tasks obtaining moderate effect sizes. The majority of studies found global processing difficulties across the ED spectrum. The results are less clear regarding local processing. Conclusions People with ED have difficulties in global processing. It is less certain as to whether they have superior local processing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to refute the weak central coherence hypothesis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":231},"references":80,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
