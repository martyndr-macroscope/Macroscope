Dietary treatment, initiated soon after birth, prevents most brain-related complications. A leading hypothesis postulates that a shortage of brain monoamines may be associated with neurocognitive deficits that are observable even in early-treated PKU. However, there is a paucity of evidence as yet for this hypothesis. Methods We therefore assessed in vivo striatal dopamine D 2/3 receptor (D 2/3 R) availability and plasma monoamine metabolite levels together with measures of impulsivity and executive functioning in 18 adults with PKU and average intellect (31.2 ± 7.4 years, nine females), most of whom were early and continuously treated. Comparison data from 12 healthy controls that did not differ in gender and age were available. Results Mean D 2/3 R availability was significantly higher (13%; p = 0.032) in the PKU group ( n = 15) than in the controls, which may reflect reduced synaptic brain dopamine levels in PKU. The PKU group had lower plasma levels of homovanillic acid ( p &lt; 0.001) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol ( p &lt; 0.0001), the predominant metabolites of dopamine and norepinephrine, respectively. Self-reported impulsivity levels were significantly higher in the PKU group compared with healthy controls ( p = 0.033). Within the PKU group, D 2/3 R availability showed a positive correlation with both impulsivity ( r = 0.72, p = 0.003) and the error rate during a cognitive flexibility task ( r = 0.59, p = 0.020). Conclusions These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that executive functioning deficits in treated adult PKU may be associated with cerebral dopamine deficiency.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":42},"references":68,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
