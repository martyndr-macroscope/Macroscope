Fine-grained analyses that tap various acculturation dimensions and population subgroups are needed to generate hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of action for the association between acculturation and mental health. Method Study participants were US Latinos ( N = 6359) from Wave 2 of the 2004–2005 National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions ( N = 34 653). We used linear χ 2 tests and logistic regression models to analyze the association between five acculturation dimensions and presence of 12-month DSM-IV mood/anxiety disorders across Latino subgroups (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, ‘Other Latinos’). Results Acculturation dimensions associated linearly with past-year presence of mood/anxiety disorders among Mexicans were: (1) younger age of immigration (linear χ 2 1 = 11.04, p &lt; 0.001), (2) longer time in the United States (linear χ 2 1 = 10.52, p &lt; 0.01), (3) greater English-language orientation (linear χ 2 1 = 14.57, p &lt; 0.001), (4) lower Latino composition of social network (linear χ 2 1 = 15.03, p &lt; 0.001), and (5) lower Latino ethnic identification (linear χ 2 1 = 7.29, p &lt; 0.01). However, the associations were less consistent among Cubans and Other Latinos, and no associations with acculturation were found among Puerto Ricans. Conclusions The relationship between different acculturation dimensions and 12-month mood/anxiety disorder varies across ethnic subgroups characterized by cultural and historical differences. The association between acculturation measures and disorder may depend on the extent to which they index protective or pathogenic adaptation pathways (e.g. loss of family support) across population subgroups preceding and/or following immigration. Future research should incorporate direct measures of maladaptive pathways and their relationship to various acculturation dimensions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":21},"references":56,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
