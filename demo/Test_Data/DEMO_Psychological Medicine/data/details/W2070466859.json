Comparisons of meditation with other altered states are reviewed and it is concluded that, on the basis of existing EEG evidence, there is some reason for differentiating between meditation and drowsing. Research on alpha-blocking and habituation of the blocking response during meditation is reviewed, and the effects of meditation on EEG patterns outside of meditation are described. In conclusion, the need for more precisely formulated research is pointed out.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":64},"references":30,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
