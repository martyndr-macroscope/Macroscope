Method In this study we employed cued fear conditioning in two independent samples of healthy subjects (sample 1: n =60, sample 2: n =52). Two graphical shapes served as conditioned stimuli and painful electrical stimulation as the unconditioned stimulus. In addition, guided by findings from published animal studies on HPA axis-related genes in fear conditioning, we examined variants of the glucocorticoid receptor and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 genes. Results Variation in these genes showed enhanced amygdala activation during the acquisition and reduced prefrontal activation during the extinction of fear as well as altered amygdala–prefrontal connectivity. Conclusions This is the first demonstration of the involvement of genes related to the HPA axis in human fear conditioning.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":15},"references":79,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
