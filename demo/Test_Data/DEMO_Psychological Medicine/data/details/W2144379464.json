We had access to original data sets from 17 studies, and used published data from the remainder. This provided us with 1346 cases from around the world. The association of EE with relapse was overwhelming, and was maintained whatever the geographical location. The predictive capacity of EE was virtually identical in men and women. While high contact with a high EE relative increased the risk of relapse, the opposite was true in low EE households. Medication and EE were independently related to relapse, and thus EE status has no bearing on the decision to prescribe. Our findings were confirmed using log–linear analysis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":433},"references":41,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
