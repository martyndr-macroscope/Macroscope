Preliminary results from the first 47 patients had previously been reported to suggest a positive association between manic-depressive disorders and HLA-A3, HLA-B7, and HLA-Bw16 and a negative association between such disorders and HLA-B8. Results from the extended series provide confirmatory evidence that there is a positive association between manic-depressive disorders and HLA-Bw16 and also strongly suggest a positive association between HLA-B7 and such disorders. HLA typing may prove to be a useful way of identifying sub-groups of manic-depressive patients for other biological studies. The associations described provide a potential lead for formulating hypotheses about the nature of the biological mechanisms which predispose to manic-depressive disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":47},"references":8,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
