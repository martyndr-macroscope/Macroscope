In contrast, sedative responses to the dopamine agonist apomorphine (5 μg/kg subcutaneously) were decreased when subjects were taking the contraceptive pill. These findings are in agreement with animal experimental studies, indicating that oestrogen can alter α-adrenoceptor and dopamine autoreceptor sensitivity. Such interactions may be involved in the effects of female sex steroids on mood.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":14},"references":32,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
