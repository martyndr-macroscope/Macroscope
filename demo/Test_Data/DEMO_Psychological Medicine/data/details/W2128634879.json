At the end of one year clinical outcome was significantly better in patients cared for by the nurse therapist. Economic outcome to one year, compared with the year before entering the trial, showed a slight decrease in the use of resources by the nurse therapist group ( N = 22), and an increase in resource usage in the GP-treated group ( N = 28), mainly due to the letter's increased absence from work and more hospital treatment and drugs. On the reasonable assumptions that nurse therapists treat 46 patients a year and that such patients treated behaviourally maintain their gains for 2 years, the economic benefits to society from nurse therapists treating such patients may outweigh the costs. This excludes any monetary value on the substantial clinical gains such as reduction in fear and anxiety. However, the numbers are small, few economic differences were significant, and many patients either did not complete the trial or waiting-list periods or they failed to return economic data. Conclusions must thus be tempered with caution, even though pre-treatment demographic and clinical data of non-returners were comparable with those of returners, and though the few drop-outs who could be rated at one year had not improved. The findings cannot be extrapolated to other types of clinical problem and treatment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":70},"references":38,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
