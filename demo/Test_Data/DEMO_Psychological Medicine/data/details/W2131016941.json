The families included 25 containing a psychiatric patient aged between 18 and 46, and three groups of 12 families each, all containing a patient over 60 (patients with dementia, a functional psychiatric disorder, or a chronic physical disorder respectively). In all cases data were obtained from key relatives. The FIQ clearly separated out the group of dementia relatives who reported the most dominant and protective behaviours and the highest levels of hostile-dominance and the lowest levels of affection. EE was not found to be so sensitive to interactions occurring in families with a member with dementia, and the possible reasons for this are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":30},"references":17,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
