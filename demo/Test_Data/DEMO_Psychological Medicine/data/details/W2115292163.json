No group showed a distinctive pattern of lateral asymmetry. The frequency of spontaneous fluctuations in electrodermal activity was greater in the anxiety state and schizophrenic groups and in those patients who reported auditory hallucinations during recording. Few schizophrenic subjects failed to respond to visual stimulation but a substantial minority failed to habituate. The implications of these findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":39},"references":67,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
