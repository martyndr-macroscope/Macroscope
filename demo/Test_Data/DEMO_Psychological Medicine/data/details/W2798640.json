The supporters reported high levels of disturbed behaviour and low levels of self-care skills in the attenders. They were also subject to high levels of social and economic burden, not all of which could be attributed to the attenders' problems. The needs assessment identified a large number of unmet needs, although the supporters themselves were largely resigned to their situation and expressed little dissatisfaction with the services they were offered. The advantage of conducting this kind of assessment of supporters' needs as a routine part of clinical practice was discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":103},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
