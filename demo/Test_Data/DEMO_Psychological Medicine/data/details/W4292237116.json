Given the symptom cyclicity of PMDD, ambulatory assessment is ideally suited to capture psychological and physiological processes across the menstrual cycle. Our study examines habitual ER-strategies in women with PMDD and their predictive value for the course of mood and basal cortisol across the cycle in affected women. Methods Women with and without PMDD ( n = 61 each) were compared regarding habitual mindfulness, reappraisal, and repetitive negative thinking (RNT). Momentary affect and cortisol output were assessed over two consecutive days per cycle phase (menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, late luteal). Results Women with PMDD reported lower mindfulness, less use of reappraisal and stronger RNT than controls ( p s &lt; 0.035). In women with PMDD, higher mindfulness and reappraisal and lower RNT predicted decreased negative and increased positive affect across the menstrual cycle ( p s &lt; 0.027). However, women using more favorable ER-strategies displayed stronger mood cyclicity, resulting in stronger mood deterioration in the late luteal phase, thereby resembling women with more unfavorable ER-strategies toward the end of the cycle. Lower mindfulness predicted lower cortisol in the menstrual phase. Conclusions Protective ER-strategies seem to be generally linked to better momentary mood in women with PMDD, but do not appear to protect affected women from premenstrual mood deterioration. Habitual mindfulness, in turn, seems to buffer blunted cortisol activity in women with PMDD, especially in the menstrual phase.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":17},"references":74,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
