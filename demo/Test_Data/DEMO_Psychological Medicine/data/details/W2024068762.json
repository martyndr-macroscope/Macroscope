The Japanese translated version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used as a measure of psychiatric symptomatology. Several sociodemographic and psychosocial factors (interpersonal factors and perceived stress) were examined as being related to psychiatric impairment. As with all other language versions, the percentage distribution of the GHQ scores was considerably skewed. Females exhibited more psychiatric symptoms than males. No significant differences were found among four age-groups for both sexes. Perceived stress related to the workplace was correlated more with psychiatric impairment than with other psychosocial factors. It was also observed that the ‘long-distance marriage’ (‘business bachelorhood’) peculiar to Japanese occupations had little influence on the impairment levels.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":17},"references":26,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
