Depressed patients had significantly greater urinary outputs of urinary-free cortisol than controls. Also, there were significant correlations among depressed patients, but not among controls, between urinary-free cortisol and urinary outputs of norepinephrine and its metabolite vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). These urinary data extend recent findings suggesting that dysregulation of both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and noradrenergic system occur together in depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":20},"references":41,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
