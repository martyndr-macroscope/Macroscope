Two separate data sets, one obtained following a multiple shooting and the other reported by McFarlane following a natural disaster, were examined. The findings of both studies provide support for a cognitive processing conceptualization of the development of post-trauma reactions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":74},"references":29,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
