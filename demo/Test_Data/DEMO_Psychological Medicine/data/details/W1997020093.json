It confirms the earlier finding of Folstein and Luria that a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship distinguishes clear cases of affective psychoses from clear non-affective disorders. Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":6,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
