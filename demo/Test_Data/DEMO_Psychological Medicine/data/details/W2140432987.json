The scales, a product of work with 1348 refugees, demonstrate conceptual significance, good reliability, concurrent validity and stability of structure across samples. They are culturally sensitive, enabling intra-cultural study as well as screening for clinical purposes. The measures also permit comparisons, for research purposes, with non-Asians.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":145},"references":44,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
