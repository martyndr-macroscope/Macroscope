A high prevalence of between 20 and 31% was found. No significant differences were found between the index and control groups with regard to a number of developmental, forensic, psychiatric, behavioural, and psychometric variables. A striking feature was the high average age of almost 30 years of the posterior temporal slow wave patients. This finding suggests that the current maturation defect hypothesis in relation to cerebral function in psychopaths requires revision. The possible role of early social and environmental factors in the genesis of these EEG anomalies is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":16},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
