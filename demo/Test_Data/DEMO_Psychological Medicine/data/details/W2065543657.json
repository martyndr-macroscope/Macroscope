Method A total of 736 people randomly selected in childhood were contacted for home or telephone interviews four times over 20 years. DSM Axis I disorders and Axis II PDs were assessed at mean age 13.7 years in 1983 and physical health was assessed in 1985–1986, 1991–1994 and 2001–2004. Results Comparisons were made between 506 adolescents without Axis I disorder or PD and adolescents with Axis I disorder or PD or both. Adolescents with an Axis I disorder ( n =150) had significantly higher odds of pain and physical illness and poorer physical health. Adolescents with a PD ( n =149) had higher odds of pain and physical illness and poorer physical health and a more rapid decline in physical health. In addition, the 81 participants with an Axis I disorder without co-morbid PD had poorer physical health, but this effect did not reach statistical significance, whereas the 80 participants with a PD but no Axis I disorder reported significantly more pain and more rapid decline in physical health. However, the 69 participants with co-morbid Axis I disorder and PD had the highest rates of pain and physical illness and the worst physical health. Conclusions Co-morbid PD accounted for many of the associations of adolescent Axis I disorder with physical health over the ensuing two decades. Co-morbid adolescent Axis I disorder and PD represent a particularly high risk for physical health.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":60},"references":62,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
