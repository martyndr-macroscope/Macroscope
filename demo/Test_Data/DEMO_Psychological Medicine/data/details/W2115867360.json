The stability of the National Adult Reading Test (NART) as a measure of pre-morbid intelligence in schizophrenia has not yet been satisfactorily established despite the widespread use of the NART in schizophrenia research. Method. We examined NART stability in a diverse group of 45 schizophrenic patients in a prospective longitudinal study over 6·5–7·5 years. Results. The results showed that NART performance does not decline significantly with increasing duration of schizophrenic illness and that test–retest reliability, even over 6·5–7·5 years, is extremely high. Discussion. Our results provide the necessary evidence that the NART can be used as a stable measure of pre-morbid intelligence in schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":38},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
