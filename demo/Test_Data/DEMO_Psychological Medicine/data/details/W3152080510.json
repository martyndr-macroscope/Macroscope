Prospection, which is an important component of anticipatory pleasure, is impaired in individuals with social anhedonia (SocAnh). In this study, we examined the neural correlates of envisioning positive future events in individuals with SocAnh. Methods Forty-nine individuals with SocAnh and 33 matched controls were recruited to undergo functional MRI scanning, during which they were instructed to simulate positive or neutral future episodes according to cue words. Two stages of prospection were distinguished: construction and elaboration. Results Reduced activation at the caudate and the precuneus when prospecting positive ( v . neutral) future events was observed in individuals with SocAnh. Furthermore, compared with controls, increased functional connectivity between the caudate and the inferior occipital gyrus during positive ( v . neutral) prospection was found in individuals with SocAnh. Both groups exhibited a similar pattern of brain activation for the construction v . elaboration contrast, regardless of the emotional context. Conclusions Our results provide further evidence on the neural mechanism of anticipatory pleasure deficits in subclinical individuals with SocAnh and suggest that altered cortico-striatal circuit may play a role in anticipatory pleasure deficits in these individuals.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":48,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
