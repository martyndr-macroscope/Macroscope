Understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning IA is crucial for enabling an accurate diagnosis and informing treatment and prevention strategies. Despite the recent increase in studies examining the neurophysiological traits of IA, their findings often vary. To enhance the accuracy of identifying key neurophysiological characteristics of IA, this study used the phase lag index (PLI) and weighted PLI (WPLI) methods, which minimize volume conduction effects, to analyze the resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity. We further evaluated the reliability of the identified features for IA classification using various machine learning methods. Methods Ninety-two participants (42 with IA and 50 healthy controls (HCs)) were included. PLI and WPLI values for each participant were computed, and values exhibiting significant differences between the two groups were selected as features for the subsequent classification task. Results Support vector machine (SVM) achieved an 83% accuracy rate using PLI features and an improved 86% accuracy rate using WPLI features. t -test results showed analogous topographical patterns for both the WPLI and PLI. Numerous connections were identified within the delta and gamma frequency bands that exhibited significant differences between the two groups, with the IA group manifesting an elevated level of phase synchronization. Conclusions Functional connectivity analysis and machine learning algorithms can jointly distinguish participants with IA from HCs based on EEG data. PLI and WPLI have substantial potential as biomarkers for identifying the neurophysiological traits of IA.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":77,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
