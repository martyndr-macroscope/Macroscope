In a survey of 60 patients encompassing all grades of severity and chronicity poor memory performance was found to be common, sometimes substantial, and disproportionately pronounced compared to the degree of general intellectual impairment. Although associated with severity and chronicity of illness, impaired memory was by no means confined to old, institutionalized, or markedly deteriorated patients. The pattern of deficit appeared to resemble that of the classic amnesic syndrome rather than that seen in Alzheimer-type dementia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":20,"cited_by_count":266},"references":29,"networkCitations":20,"seed":false}
