Possible explanations for the reported low prevalence of MDD were evaluated. Method As part of a survey of common psychiatric disorders in a nationally representative sample of individuals aged ⩾18 years who were non-institutionalized civilians in Taiwan, a face-to-face interview using the paper version of the World Mental Health Survey of the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI) was conducted between 2003 and 2005. Functional impairment and help-seeking behaviors were compared between Taiwanese subjects with MDD and their counterparts in the USA. Results Among the 10 135 respondents, the lifetime prevalence of MDD was 1.20% [standard error ( s.e .)=0.2%]. Individuals who were divorced or widowed, aged ⩽40 years, and female were at increased risk, whereas rural residents were at lower risk for MDD. The proportion of MDD cases co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders in this study was much lower than in the US study. Only one-third of Taiwanese individuals with MDD sought help despite having twice the number of lost workdays compared with the US sample. Conclusions Despite the low prevalence of MDD in Taiwanese adults, the pattern of low help-seeking behavior and profound functional impairment indicates much room for improvement in the early detection of and intervention in major depression in this population.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":117},"references":32,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
