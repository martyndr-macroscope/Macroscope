It is unclear whether it is associated with the same pattern of neuropsychological deficits as confabulation in neurological patients. Method Thirty-four patients with chronic schizophrenia, including those with and without thought disorder, and 17 healthy controls were given a fable recall task to elicit confabulation. They were also examined on a range of executive, episodic and semantic memory tests. Results Confabulation was seen at a significantly higher rate in the schizophrenic patients than the controls, and predominated in those with thought disorder. Neuropsychologically, it was not a function of general intellectual impairment, and was not clearly related to episodic memory or executive impairment. However, there were indications of an association with semantic memory impairment. Conclusions The findings support the existence of a form of confabulation in schizophrenia that is related to thought disorder and has a different neuropsychological signature to the neurological form of the symptom.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":15},"references":39,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
