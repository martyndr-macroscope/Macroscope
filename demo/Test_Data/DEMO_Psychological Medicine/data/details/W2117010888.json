This report details the observation on those subjects diagnosed with compulsive personality disorder and compulsive personality traits. The results indicate that this condition has a prevalence of 1·7% in a general population. Male, white, married and employed individuals receive this diagnosis most often. Our data suggest a dimensional rather than categorical character for this disorder. The disorder imparts a vulnerability for the development of anxiety disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":66},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
