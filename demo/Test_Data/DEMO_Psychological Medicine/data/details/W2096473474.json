However, there are also contradictory studies in the literature. Therefore we measured serum DBH in chronic alcoholics followed for 12 months in a treatment programme after psychiatric hospitalization for acute alcoholism. Mean serum DBH activity in the alcoholics was unchanged from controls at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months following hospital discharge. These data imply that serum DBH activity does not provide a useful metabolic screen for vulnerability to chronic alcoholism. However, prospective studies of patients at high risk to develop alcoholism will be helpful in further clarification of this issue.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":25,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
