This suggests that vagal neurostimulation could interact with contemplative psychotherapies (e.g. mindfulness and compassion-based interventions) to augment their efficacy. Methods In a fully factorial experimental trial, healthy adults ( n = 120) were randomized to transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) plus Self-Compassion-Mental-Imagery Training (SC-MIT) or alternative factorial combinations of stimulation (tVNS or sham) plus mental imagery training (MIT: SC-MIT or Control-MIT). Primary outcomes were self-reported state self-compassion, self-criticism, and heart rate variability (HRV). Exploratory outcomes included state mindfulness and oculomotor attentional bias to compassion-expressing faces. Most outcomes were assessed acutely on session 1 at the pre-stimulation (T1), peri-stimulation (T2), and post-MIT + stimulation (T3) timepoints, and after daily stimulation+MIT sessions (eight sessions). Results During session 1, a significant Timepoint × Stimulation × MIT interaction ( p = 0.025) was observed, reflecting a larger acute T1→T3 increase in state self-compassion after tVNS+SC-MIT, with similar rapid effects on state mindfulness. Additionally, significant Session × MIT and Session × Stimulation interactions ( p ≤ 0.027) on state mindfulness (but not self-compassion) suggested that tVNS+SC-MIT’s effects may accumulate across sessions for some outcomes. By contrast, changes in state self-criticism and compassion-related attentional bias were only moderated by MIT (not stimulation) condition. HRV was unaffected by stimulation or MIT condition. Conclusion tVNS augmented the effects of SC-MIT and might, therefore, be a useful strategy for enhancing meditation-based psychotherapies. Our findings also highlight the value of oculomotor attentional metrics as responsive markers of self-compassion training and the continued need for sensitive indices of successful vagal stimulation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":73,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
