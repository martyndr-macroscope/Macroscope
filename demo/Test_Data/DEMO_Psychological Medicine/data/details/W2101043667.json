Psychiatry has kept abreast of this movement (Geddes et al . 1997) and claims have been made that randomized-controlled trials (the highest quality primary evaluative research) can be used to justify 65% of routine clinical decisions (Geddes et al . 1996). However, it is largely published research that forms the ‘knowledge base’ of the evidence movement. A fundamental difficulty arises when published research results are a biased sample of all research results – published and unpublished. Publication bias presents one such threat and has been much discussed in wider healthcare (Easterbrook et al . 1991; Dickersin &amp; Min, 1993; Dickersin, 1997), but has been little discussed or researched in psychiatry, despite the fact that psychiatry is likely to be at least as prone to publication bias as other specialities.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":61},"references":40,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
