This propositional framework is then used to specify some conditions for a positive culture of old age and to advance one possible model of good psychological ageing. This model focuses on the dynamic interplay between three processes: selection, optimization, and compensation. The model is universal in its basic features, but at the same time emphasizes individual variations in phenotypic manifestation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":120},"references":117,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
