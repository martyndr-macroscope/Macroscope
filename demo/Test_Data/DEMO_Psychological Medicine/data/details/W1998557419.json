The data comprise 6 years′ records. Simple Markov chains are fitted to each age-group of men and women, and the inter-practice variation in the resulting parameter estimates are compared, using Andrews′ plots and principal components plots. The implications for the presentation and interpretation of data from large-scale morbidity surveys are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":15},"references":19,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
