The study shows that parental social class does influence the outcome of early parent death and that early bereaved subjects do lag behind in social class status.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":15},"references":20,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
