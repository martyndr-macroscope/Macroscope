The Italian versions of both the GHQ and the CIS were found to be feasible instruments for general practice studies in Italy. GHQ misclassification rates, sensitivity and specificity values are presented for different cut-off scores, a total score of 5 or more being the best discriminator between ‘cases’ and ‘non-cases’. The prevalence of confirmed cases in this sample was 47·5%, a rate higher than those reported so far in developed and developing countries.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":74},"references":23,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
