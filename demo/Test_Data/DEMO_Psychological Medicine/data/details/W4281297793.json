Methods In the current study, segmentation of amygdala and hippocampal sub-regions was used to investigate the longitudinal changes of volume, the relationship between volume and antidepressant effects, and prediction performances for ECT in MDD patients before and after ECT using two independent datasets. Results As a result, MDD patients showed selectively and consistently increased volume in the left lateral nucleus, right accessory basal nucleus, bilateral basal nucleus, bilateral corticoamygdaloid transition (CAT), bilateral paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala, and bilateral hippocampus-amygdala transition area (HATA) after ECT in both datasets, whereas marginally significant increase of volume in bilateral granule cell molecular layer of the head of dentate gyrus, the bilateral head of cornu ammonis (CA) 4, and left head of CA 3. Correlation analyses revealed that increased volume of left HATA was significantly associated with antidepressant effects after ECT. Moreover, volumes of HATA in the MDD patients before ECT could be served as potential biomarkers to predict ECT remission with the highest accuracy of 86.95% and 82.92% in two datasets (The predictive models were trained on Dataset 2 and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Dataset 2 were obtained from leave-one-out-cross-validation. Thus, they were not independent and very likely to be inflated). Conclusions These results not only suggested that ECT could selectively induce structural plasticity of the amygdala and hippocampal sub-regions associated with antidepressant effects of ECT in MDD patients, but also provided potential biomarkers (especially HATA) for effectively and timely interventions for ECT in clinical applications.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":17},"references":66,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
