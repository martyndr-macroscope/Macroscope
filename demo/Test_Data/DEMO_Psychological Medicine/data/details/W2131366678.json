Method Ninety-six male offenders with ASPD who were assessed using the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV) and 49 male right-handed healthy controls (HCs), matched for age and IQ, completed a neuropsychological test battery. Results Offenders with ASPD displayed subtle impairments on executive function tasks of planning ability and set shifting and behavioural inhibition compared to HCs. However, among the offenders with ASPD there was no significant association between executive function impairment and scores on the measure of psychopathy. Conclusions Psychopathic traits in offenders with ASPD are not associated with greater executive function impairment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":65},"references":77,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
