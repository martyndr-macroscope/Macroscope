It was modified to accord with the 1987 draft of the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and used to assess the pre-morbid personality of first-admission patients in one London area over the period of one year. Of the 120 (84% of the total sample of first-admissions) patients included, 43 (36%) were found to satisfy the ICD-10 criteria for personality disorder and a further 17 (14%) to satisfy the criteria for personality trait accentuation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":57},"references":20,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
