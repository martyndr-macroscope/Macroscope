At least four differing aims of psychotherapeutic techniques can be distinguished—to produce a rewarding experience; to nurture self-knowledge; to allow confession or catharsis; and to effect a lasting change in behaviour. The report concentrates on the last two aims. Effects of psychological treatments are considered first by syndromes and then by procedures. Prognostic issues are defined and research strategies outlined. Further work is suggested, including the relief of acute neurotic distress before referral for specialist help, the combination of psychotropic drugs and psychological treatments, the application of specific psychotherapeutic techniques for defined ends, and elucidation of the active therapeutic ingredients in these methods.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":16},"references":108,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
