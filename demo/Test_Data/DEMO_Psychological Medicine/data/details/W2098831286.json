Although the PSE was originally developed for use by psychiatrists with patients with obvious mental illness, the interview also contains sections dealing in considerable detail with the commoner and less severe complaints and symptoms that are found in a significant proportion of ‘normal subjects’. A shortened version of the PSE (8th edition) is described, limited to these sections, which has been used in population surveys, by interviewers who are not psychiatrists. The training of such interviewers is described, and information on a reliability and repeatability study is presented. This shows that with proper training, non-psychiatric interviewers can achieve standards of inter-rater reliability that are comparable to those previously reported between psychiatrists.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":115},"references":10,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
