Recent work has begun to examine how environmental contexts (e.g. locations) influence negative symptoms. However, limited work has evaluated how environments may contribute to negative symptoms among youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). The current study uses Ecological Momentary Assessment to assess how four environmental contexts (locations, activities, social interactions, social interaction method) impact state fluctuations in negative symptoms in CHR and healthy control (CN) participants. Methods CHR youth ( n = 116) and CN ( n = 61) completed 8 daily surveys for 6 days assessing negative symptoms and contexts. Results Mixed-effects modeling demonstrated that negative symptoms largely varied across contexts in both groups. CHR participants had higher negative symptoms than CN participants in most contexts, but groups had similar symptom reductions during recreational activities and phone call interactions. Among CHR participants, negative symptoms were elevated in several contexts, including studying/working, commuting, eating, running errands, and being at home. Conclusions Results demonstrate that negative symptoms dynamically change across some contexts in CHR participants. Negative symptoms were more intact in some contexts, while other contexts, notably some used to promote functional recovery, may exacerbate negative symptoms in CHR. Findings suggest that environmental factors should be considered when understanding state fluctuations in negative symptoms among those at CHR participants.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":10},"references":46,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
