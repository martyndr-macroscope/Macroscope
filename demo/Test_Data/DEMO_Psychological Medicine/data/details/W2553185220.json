Several studies suggest that this underperformance is due to cognitive deficits that commence before disease onset and reflect a genetic risk for this disorder. However, the specificity and the familial contribution of this cognitive deficit are not clear. We analysed lifetime educational achievement of psychiatric patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar or depressive disorder and their unaffected siblings. Method In a register-based case-control study, 1561 patients with schizophrenia, 813 patients with bipolar disorder, 8112 patients with depression, and their siblings were each matched with eight population controls. Patients, siblings and controls were compared on the highest educational stream they completed. Results Lower educational achievement was present in schizophrenia patients from primary school onwards [completing primary school: odds ratio (OR) 0.69; completing secondary school: OR 0.69; completing academic education: OR 0.46], compared to patients with bipolar disorder or depression. Siblings of schizophrenia, bipolar or depressed patients showed no underachievement at primary or secondary school, but siblings of schizophrenia patients as well as siblings of depressed patients were less successful in their educational achievement after secondary school (completing academic education, schizophrenia siblings: OR 0.90; depressive disorder siblings: OR 0.91). Conclusions Educational underachievement from primary school onwards is specifically related to schizophrenia and not to bipolar disorder or depression. Moreover, it appears to be a harbinger of the illness, since it is not found in their siblings. These results add to evidence that early cognitive deficits are a distinct feature of the schizophrenia phenotype.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":44},"references":39,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
