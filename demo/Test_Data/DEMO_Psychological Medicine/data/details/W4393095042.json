However, the specific role of Hb in OCD remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the structural and functional abnormalities of Hb in OCD and their relationship with the clinical symptoms. Methods Eighty patients with OCD and 85 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited as the primary dataset. The grey matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity (FC), and effective connectivity (EC) of the Hb were calculated and compared between OCD group and HCs. An independent replication dataset was used to verify the stability and robustness of the results. Results Patients with OCD exhibited smaller Hb volume and increased FC of right Hb-left hippocampus than HCs. Dynamic causal model revealed an increased EC from left hippocampus to right Hb and a less inhibitory causal influence from the right Hb to left hippocampus in the OCD group compared to HCs. Similar results were found in the replication dataset. Conclusions This study suggested that abnormal structure of Hb and hippocampus-Hb connectivity may contribute to the pathological basis of OCD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":46,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
