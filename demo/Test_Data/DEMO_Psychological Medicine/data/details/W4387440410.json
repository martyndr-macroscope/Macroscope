However, CT associations with dynamic affect fluctuations while considering differences in mean affect levels across CT status have been understudied. Methods 346 adults (age = 49.25 ± 12.55, 67.0% female) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety participated in ecological momentary assessment. Positive and negative affect (PA, NA) were measured five times per day for two weeks by electronic diaries. Retrospectively-reported CT included emotional neglect and emotional/physical/sexual abuse. Linear regressions determined associations between CT and affect fluctuations, controlling for age, sex, education, and mean affect levels. Results Compared to those without CT, individuals with CT reported significantly lower mean PA levels (Cohen's d = −0.620) and higher mean NA levels ( d = 0.556) throughout the two weeks. CT was linked to significantly greater PA variability ( d = 0.336), NA variability ( d = 0.353), and NA autocorrelation ( d = 0.308), with strongest effects for individuals reporting higher CT scores. However, these effects were entirely explained by differences in mean affect levels between the CT groups. Findings suggested consistency of results in adults with and without lifetime depressive/anxiety disorders and across CT types, with sexual abuse showing the smallest effects. Conclusions Individuals with CT show greater affective dysregulation during the two-week monitoring of emotional symptoms, likely due to their consistently lower PA and higher NA levels. It is essential to consider mean affect level when interpreting the impact of CT on affect dynamics.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":4},"references":83,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
