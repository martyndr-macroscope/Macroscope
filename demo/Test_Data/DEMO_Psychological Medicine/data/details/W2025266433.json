Suggestions are made for changes which would facilitate the use of the I.C.D. , firstly for furnishing quantitative data to answer questions about groups of cases, and secondly for retrieval of information about patients with particular syndromes for purposes of research studies. Finally, a multi-axial system for diagnostic coding is described.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":36},"references":10,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
