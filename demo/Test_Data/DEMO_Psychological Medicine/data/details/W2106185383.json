These measures were correlated with three angiographic indices of coronary heart disease (CHD) severity and two clinical indices (angina and the duration of CHD). The only psychological measures associated with atherosclerosis (assessed by angiography) were indices of personality: Type A (the Jenkins Activity Survey), trait tension, trait anxiety and suppression of anger. It was concluded that these traits may have some role in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis. None of the measures of psychological symptoms showed a significant association with angiography indices. However, depressive symptoms and expressed hostility were associated with the severity of angina and duration of heart disease. It was concluded that these affects are the consequences of the physical disability of CHD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":34},"references":29,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
