Among city doctors, the greater the number of years since qualification the more patients were referred. Single-handed city doctors also had very high referral rates. Subsequent interviews were conducted with 76 general practitioners. Topics covered included reasons for referral to psychiatric services. Psychotics, severely depressed patients, alcoholics and violent patients were the most frequently referred groups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":51},"references":24,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
