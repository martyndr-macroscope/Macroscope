At initial assessment the assaulted group, compared to the controls showed a significant increase in psychiatric impairment and distress (as measured by the GHQ-30 and IES respectively), with 23% of assault victims developing post-traumatic stress disorder as defined by DSM-III-R. At follow-up, while high levels of both psychiatric impairment and distress persisted there was evidence that they may be separate phenomena.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":23},"references":50,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
