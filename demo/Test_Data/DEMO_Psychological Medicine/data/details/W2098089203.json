Test–retest reliabilities for both the life event and difficulty measures are shown to be adequate if based on ‘consensus’ ratings. The question is raised of generalizability of the concepts of ‘threat’ and ‘severity’ across the lifespan.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":10},"references":14,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
