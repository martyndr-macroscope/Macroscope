Methods Studies on individuals with FEP defined as drug-naïve (0 days exposure to antipsychotics) were included to conduct a systematic review. A meta-analysis of proportions for the prevalence of MetS in antipsychotic-naïve patients was performed. Prevalence estimates and 95% CI were calculated using a random-effect model. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to identify sources and the amount of heterogeneity were also conducted. Results The search yielded 4143 articles. After the removal of duplicates, 2473 abstracts and titles were screened. At the full-text stage, 112 were screened, 18 articles were included in a systematic review and 13 articles in the main statistical analysis. The prevalence of MetS in naïve (0 days) FEP is 13.2% (95% CI 8.7–19.0). Ethnicity accounted for 3% of the heterogeneity between studies, and diagnostic criteria used for MetS accounted for 7%. When compared with controls matched by sex and age, the odds ratio is 2.52 (95% CI 1.29–5.07; p = 0.007). Conclusions Our findings of increased rates of MetS in naïve FEP patients suggest that we are underestimating cardiovascular risk in this population, especially in those of non-Caucasian origin. Our findings support that altered metabolic parameters in FEPs are not exclusively due to antipsychotic treatments.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":56},"references":73,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
