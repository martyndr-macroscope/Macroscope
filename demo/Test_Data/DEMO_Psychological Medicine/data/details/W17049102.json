The finding of shared environmental influences only in antisocial behavior suggests an etiological distinction between psychopathic personality dimensions and antisocial behavior. Knowledge about temperamental correlates to antisocial behavior is important for identification of susceptibility genes, as well as for possible prevention through identification of at-risk children early in life.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":99},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
