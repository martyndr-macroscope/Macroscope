A significant relationship was found between attitudes as measured by means of a semantic differential during hospitalization and later relapse. Lack of treatment compliance, negative symptoms, unemployment and poor pre-morbid adjustment were also associated with relapse. In a multivariate analysis some of these variables changed their predictive power but the association between attitudes and relapse was maintained.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":15},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
