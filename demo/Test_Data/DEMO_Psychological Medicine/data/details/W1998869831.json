Subjects were tested and scored blindly and scoring was shown to be reliable. Although a statistically significant difference was found between the two groups, the marked overlap of the distribution of scores found in this study is not compatible with theories advanced by other authors concerning communication abnormality in parents of schizophrenics. Evidence is presented which provides a more parsimonious explanation of the difference between groups and leads to a hypothesis which would explain the failure of this study to confirm the striking differences between groups reported by previous workers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":44},"references":8,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
