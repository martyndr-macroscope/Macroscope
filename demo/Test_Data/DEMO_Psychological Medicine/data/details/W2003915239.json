Results indicated that specific phobia patients and non-phobic control subjects exhibit a similar pattern of defences. Also, the study investigated whether specific DSQ defence styles affect behaviour therapy outcome. It was found that an immature defence style, and especially the defence mechanism projection, was related to less favourable treatment results.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":16},"references":20,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
