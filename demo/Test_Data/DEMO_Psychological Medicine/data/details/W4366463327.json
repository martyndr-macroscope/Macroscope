Stress, a known risk factor for psychosis in the general population, has seldom been studied in 22q11Del. We investigated how lifetime stressors related to symptomatic outcomes in patients with 22q11Del. We also explored this association in individuals with 22q11.2 duplications (22q11Dup), which may be potentially protective against psychosis. Method One hundred individuals (46 with 22q11Del, 30 with 22q11Dup, and 24 healthy controls; M age = 17.30 years±10.15) were included. Logistic models were used to examine cross-sectional associations between lifetime acute and chronic stressors (severity and count) and the presence (score ⩾3) of positive, negative, and general symptoms, assessed via the Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes (SIPS). Results The 22q11Dup group reported the greatest number and severity of acute lifetime stressors, but did not differ from 22q11Del in chronic stressor count or severity. Lifetime chronic and acute stressors were uniquely associated with positive symptoms in 22q11Del (chronic count: odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, p = 0.02; chronic severity: OR = 1.88, p = 0.03; acute count: OR = 1.78, p = 0.03), but not with negative or general symptoms ( p s &gt; 0.05). Conclusion Findings suggest that stress may play a role in psychotic symptoms in 22q1Del, while the 22q11Dup CNV appears protective against psychotic symptoms despite higher rates of stressors. Interventions that mitigate effects of stressors in 22qDel may reduce the odds of psychosis in this group. Prospective longitudinal research is needed to replicate these findings.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":5},"references":44,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
