The association between length of unemployment and psychological ill-health was found to be strongest in the middle age groups, with greater ill-health among those with a longer duration since job loss. No association between duration and ill-health was found for those who had recently entered the labour market or who were close to the end of their working lives. Desire for a job and financial stress were shown to be additional mediators of psychological ill-health during employment. A cumulative stress model is proposed to account for these findings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":211},"references":34,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
