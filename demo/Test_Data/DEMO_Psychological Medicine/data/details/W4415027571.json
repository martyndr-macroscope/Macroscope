Aberrant functional connectivity among various brain regions has been reported in LOD, but their abnormal patterns of functional network connectivity remain unclear in LOD. Methods A total of 82 LOD and 101 healthy older adults (HOA) accepted functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Static functional network connectivity (sFNC) and dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) were analyzed using independent component analysis, with dFNC assessed via a sliding window approach. Both sFNC and dFNC contributions were classified using a support vector machine. Results LOD exhibited decreased sFNC among the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and language network (LAN), along with reduced dFNC of DMN-SN and SN-SMN. The sFNC of SMN-LAN and dFNC of DMN-SN contributed the most in differentiating LOD and HOA by support vector machine. Additionally, abnormal sFNC of DMN-SN and DMN-SMN both correlated with working memory, with DMN-SMN mediating the relationship between depression and working memory. The dFNC of SN-SMN was associated with depressive severity and multiple domains of cognition, and mediated the impact of depression on memory and semantic function. Conclusions This study displayed the abnormal connectivity among DMN, SN, and SMN that involved the relationship between depression and cognition in LOD, which might reveal mutual biomarkers between depression and cognitive decline in LOD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":92,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
