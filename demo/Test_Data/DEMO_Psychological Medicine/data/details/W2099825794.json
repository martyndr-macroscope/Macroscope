There was no evidence that a desire for the operation fulfilled ‘psychological needs’ for parents or was a means of coping with a ‘deviant’ child. Parents favouring tonsillectomy were less well informed, and the educational role of the general practitioner in reducing the small number of those who inappropriately pressurize medical services is highlighted.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
