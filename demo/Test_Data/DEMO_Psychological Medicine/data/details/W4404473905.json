The functional gradient deficits of drug-naïve FES and its relationship to gene expression profiles and treatment outcomes are unknown. Methods In this study, we engaged a cohort of 116 FES and 100 healthy controls (HC), aged 7 to 30 years, including 15 FES over an 8-week antipsychotic medication regimen. Our examination focused on primary-to-transmodal alterations in voxel-based connection gradients in FES. Then, we employed network topology, Neurosynth, postmortem gene expression, and support vector regression to evaluate integration and segregation functions, meta-analytic cognitive terms, transcriptional patterns, and treatment predictions. Results FES displayed diminished global connectome gradients (Cohen's d = 0.32–0.57) correlated with compensatory integration and segregation functions (Cohen's d = 0.31–0.36). Predominant alterations were observed in the default (67.6%) and sensorimotor (21.9%) network, related to high-order cognitive functions. Furthermore, we identified notable overlaps between partial least squares (PLS1) weighted genes and dysregulated genes in other psychiatric conditions. Genes linked with gradient alterations were enriched in synaptic signaling, neurodevelopment process, specific astrocytes, cortical layers (layer II and IV), and developmental phases from late/mid fetal to young adulthood. Additionally, the onset age influenced the severity of FES, with discernible differences in connection gradients between minor- and adult-FES. Moreover, the connectivity gradients of FES at baseline significantly predicted treatment outcomes. Conclusions These results offer significant theoretical foundations for elucidating the intricate interplay between macroscopic functional connection gradient changes and microscopic transcriptional patterns during the onset and progression of FES.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":63,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
