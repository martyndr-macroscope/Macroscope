Although there were many points of similarity between the two classes of phenomena, none of the medieval visionaries was identified as mentally ill. The role of cultural norms in determining the attribution of mental illness, and the limitations of Euro-American criteria of psychoses, are discussed in the light of these findings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":45},"references":67,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
