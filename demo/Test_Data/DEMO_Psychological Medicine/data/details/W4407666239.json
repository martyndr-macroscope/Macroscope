Methods We used genomic structural equation modeling and genome-wide association studies ( N = 79,729–903,147) to examine the latent genetic architecture of nine impulsivity traits and seven substance use (SU) and SUD traits. Results We found that the SU and SUD factors were strongly genetically inter-correlated ( r G =0.77) but their associations with impulsivity facets differed. Lack of premeditation, negative and positive urgency were equally positively genetically correlated with both the SU ( r G =.0.30–0.50) and SUD ( r G = 0.38–0.46) factors; sensation seeking was more strongly genetically correlated with the SU factor ( r G =0.27 versus r G =0.10); delay discounting was more strongly genetically correlated with the SUD factor ( r G =0.31 versus r G =0.21); and lack of perseverance was only weakly genetically correlated with the SU factor ( r G =0.10). After controlling for the genetic correlation between SU/SUD, we found that lack of premeditation was independently genetically associated with both the SU (β=0.42) and SUD factors (β=0.21); sensation seeking and positive urgency were independently genetically associated with the SU factor (β=0.48, β=0.33, respectively); and negative urgency and delay discounting were independently genetically associated with the SUD factor (β=0.33, β=0.36, respectively). Conclusions Our findings show that specific impulsivity facets confer risk for distinct stages of substance use involvement, with potential implications for SUDs prevention and treatment.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":110,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
