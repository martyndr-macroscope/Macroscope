Their mutual concordance is very low (mean 0·19) showing that there is very poor agreement about the meaning of the term ‘schizo-affective’ at present. Ten patients (4·5 % of admissions and 8 % of psychotic admissions within the age group studied) satisfied 3 definitions, a figure which demonstrates the numerical importance of this group of unclassified mental disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":129},"references":28,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
