This study investigated the association of oxidative stress, measured by plasma levels of F2-isoprostanes and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) reflecting oxidative lipid and DNA damage respectively, with MDD, anxiety disorders and antidepressant use in a large cohort. Method Data was derived from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety including patients with current ( N = 1619) or remitted ( N = 610) MDD and/or anxiety disorder(s) (of which N = 704 antidepressant users) and 612 controls. Diagnoses were established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Plasma 8-OHdG and F2-isoprostanes were measured using LC-MS/MS. ANCOVA was performed adjusted for sampling, sociodemographic, health and lifestyle variables. Results F2-isoprostanes did not differ between controls and patients, or by antidepressant use. Patients with current disorders had lower 8-OHdG (mean 42.1 pmol/l, 95% CI 40.4–43.8) compared to controls (45.0 pmol/l, 95% CI 42.9–47.2; p &lt; 0.001) after adjustment for sampling, sociodemographics and lifestyle, but these differences disappeared after further adjustment for antidepressant use ( p = 0.562). Antidepressant users had lower 8-OHdG levels (38.2 pmol/l, 95% CI 36.5–39.9) compared to controls (44.9 pmol/l, 95% CI 43.2–46.6; Cohen's d = 0.21, p &lt; 0.001). Results for 8-OHdG were comparable across disorders (MDD and/or anxiety disorders), and all antidepressant types (SSRIs, TCAs, other antidepressants). Conclusion Contrary to previous findings this large-scale study found no increased oxidative stress in MDD and anxiety disorders. Antidepressant use was associated with lower oxidative DNA damage, suggesting antidepressants may have antioxidant effects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":85},"references":66,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
