There was no significant difference in androgen levels between the homosexual and control group, nor was there any relationship between androgen levels and response to treatment. These results suggest that androgen levels have no aetiological significance in treatment-seeking homosexuals and have no relevance as indicators of treatment outcome.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":9},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
