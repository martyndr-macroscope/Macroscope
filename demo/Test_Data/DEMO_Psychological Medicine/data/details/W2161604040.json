Some of the test groups included schizophrenic patients, others comprised groups with dyslexia, reading disability and left preference. The EEG differences between the test and control groups are shown to be similar across the studies. It is suggested that the common attribute of the test groups relates to the functional organisation of the brain and that investigation of EEG correlates of this phenomenon may be of value to research into the biological basis of psychiatric illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":14,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
