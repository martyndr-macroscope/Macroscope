This study was conducted to examine these relationships in a large database of disaster survivors consistently studied across 12 different incidents of the full range of disaster typology. Methods Analysis was conducted on a merged database representing 1187 trauma-exposed survivors of 12 different disasters studied systematically. DSM-IV-TR criteria for disaster-related PTSD were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Results PTSD Group C (avoidance/numbing) and numbing specifically were less common and more associated than other symptom groups with criterion F (distress/impairment). Consistently in multivariable models, group C and numbing were independently associated with criterion F. Group D (hyperarousal) was less strongly associated with criterion F. Neither group B (intrusion) nor avoidance were associated with criterion F. Conclusions In this and other studies, group C and numbing specifically have been shown to be associated with criterion F, which is consistent with the demonstration that group C and the numbing component specifically are central to the psychopathology of PTSD. The addition of the distress/impairment requirement broadly across the psychiatric diagnoses in DSM-IV added little value to PTSD symptom criteria. Future revisions of diagnostic criteria may benefit by carefully considering these findings to possibly re-include a prominent numbing symptom section.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":11},"references":49,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
