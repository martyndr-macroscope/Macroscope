Neuropsychological function and cognitive correlates of depression have not previously been examined in a rigorously defined population of patients suffering from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Method. Mood, neuropsychological function and cognition were measured in 10 PMDD patients and 10 age-matched controls in both phases of the menstrual cycle in a random order, counter-balanced design. Results. The BDI was significantly elevated in the luteal phase of PMDD patients only while other cognitive measures showed no significant differences. Working memory was impaired in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle with no significant differences between PMDD and control subjects. Conclusion. Despite the small sample size, these results show that the BDI is sensitive to the mood fluctuations of PMDD patients. An impairment in working memory was also found although this is a general menstrual cycle effect.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":54},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
