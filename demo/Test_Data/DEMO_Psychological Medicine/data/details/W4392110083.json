An FEP 10-year follow-up study investigated the rate of personal recovery, emotional wellbeing, and clinical recovery in the total sample and between psychotic bipolar spectrum disorders (BD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ); and how these positive outcomes overlap. Methods FEP participants ( n = 128) were re-assessed with structured clinical interviews at 10-year follow-up. Personal recovery was self-rated with the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery-15-item scale (total score ⩾45). Emotional wellbeing was self-rated with the Life Satisfaction Scale (score ⩾5) and the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (total score ⩾72). Clinical recovery was clinician-rated symptom-remission and adequate functioning (duration minimum 1 year). Results In FEP, rates of personal recovery (50.8%), life satisfaction (60.9%), and pleasure (57.5%) were higher than clinical recovery (33.6%). Despite lower rates of clinical recovery in SZ compared to BD, they had equal rates of personal recovery and emotional wellbeing. Personal recovery overlapped more with emotional wellbeing than with clinical recovery (χ 2 ). Each participant was assigned to one of eight possible outcome groups depending on the combination of positive outcomes fulfilled. The eight groups collapsed into three equal-sized main outcome groups: 33.6% clinical recovery with personal recovery and/or emotional wellbeing; 34.4% personal recovery and/or emotional wellbeing only; and 32.0% none. Conclusions In FEP, 68% had minimum one positive outcome after 10 years, suggesting a good life with psychosis. This knowledge must be shared to instill hope and underlines that subjective and objective positive outcomes must be assessed and targeted in treatment.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":65,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
