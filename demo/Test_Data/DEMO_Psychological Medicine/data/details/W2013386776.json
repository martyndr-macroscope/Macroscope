These early studies were financed by the Department of Education and Science and the Foundation for Child Development (then the Association for the Aid of Crippled Children). The findings were fully reported in two books (Rutter, Tizard &amp; Whitmore, 1970; Rutter, Graham &amp; Yule, 1970) and only brief details are included here.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":674},"references":56,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
