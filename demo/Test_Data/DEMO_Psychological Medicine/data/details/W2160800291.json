Those who had experienced seizures were more commonly first born and had a history of post-natal brain damage. During the week preceding the seizure there had been a marked increase in drug prescribing. The implications for drug management are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":62},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
