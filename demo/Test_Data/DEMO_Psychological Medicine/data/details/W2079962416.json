This paper describes a special analysis made by a medical sociologist into the problems of these 29 patients as perceived by their relatives. Assessment of the patient's handicaps and the burden felt by the family showed a dependence on parents of pensionable age which is an obstacle to rehabilitation. Patients were content, but relatives were dissatisfied and experienced considerable financial burden and symptoms of reactive anxiety and depression. The need for special services is emphasized to help the patient towards a more independent existence when the relative dies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":56},"references":51,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
