The psychosis and endocrine disorder were subsequently cured by adrenalectomy. Twenty-five years previously the patient had a typical schizophrenic psychosis treated in mental hospital with deep insulin therapy and ECT. The possibility is raised that deep insulin therapy could have induced the Cushing's syndrome through its non-specific stressor effect on the pituitary-adrenal axis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":10},"references":25,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
