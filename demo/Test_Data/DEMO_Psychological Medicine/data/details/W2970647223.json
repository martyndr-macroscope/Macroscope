A few studies have evaluated NES longitudinally and as a predictor for diagnostic and response classification, but these studies have been confounded, underpowered and divergent. We examined (1) baseline and longitudinal NES differences between diagnostic and year 1 response groups; (2) if NES predicts diagnostic and response groups and (3) relationships between clinical variables and NES measures in antipsychotic-naïve FEP. Methods NES and clinical measures were obtained for FEP-schizophrenia (FEP-SZ, n = 232), FEP non-schizophrenia (FEP-NSZ, n = 117) and healthy controls (HC, n = 204). Response groups with &gt;25% improvement in average year 1 positive and negative symptomatology scores were classified as responsive ( n = 97) and &lt;25% improvement as non-responsive ( n = 95). Analysis of covariance, NES trajectory analysis and logistic regression models assessed diagnostic and response group differences. Baseline and longitudinal NES relationships with clinical variables were performed with Spearman correlations. Data were adjusted for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status and handedness. Results Cognitive perceptual (COGPER) score was better than repetitive motor (REPMOT) at differentiating FEP-SZ from FEP-NSZ and distinguishing responders from non-responders. We identified significant group-specific associations between COGPER and worse GAF, positive and negative symptomatology and some of these findings persisted at 1-year assessment. Conclusion NES are an easy to administer, bedside-elicited, endophenotypic measure and could be a cost-effective clinical tool in antipsychotic-naïve FEP.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":7},"references":33,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
