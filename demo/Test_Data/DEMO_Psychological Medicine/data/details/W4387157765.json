For some people, it can take months to years of a trial-and-error process to identify a medication with the ideal efficacy and tolerability profile. Current strategies (e.g. clinical practice guidelines, treatment algorithms) for addressing this issue can be useful at the population level, but often fall short at the individual level. This is, in part, attributed to interindividual variation in genes that are involved in pharmacokinetic (i.e. absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) and pharmacodynamic (e.g. receptors, signaling pathways) processes that in large part, determine whether a medication will be efficacious or tolerable. A precision prescribing strategy know as pharmacogenomics (PGx) assesses these genomic variations, and uses it to inform selection and dosing of certain psychotropic medications. In this review, we describe the path that led to the emergence of PGx in psychiatry, the current evidence base and implementation status of PGx in the psychiatric clinic, and finally, the future growth potential of precision psychiatry via the convergence of the PGx-guided strategy with emerging technologies and approaches (i.e. pharmacoepigenomics, pharmacomicrobiomics, pharmacotranscriptomics, pharmacoproteomics, pharmacometabolomics) to personalize treatment of psychiatric disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":38},"references":99,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
