It is made up of three standardized time-cued sets of questions focusing on three life periods: adolescence, early and late adulthood, with five questions for each life period. Standardized testing procedure, checking for veracity and scoring methods are described. Normative data from 157 healthy individuals aged over 55 are converted into ‘equivalent scores’ for use with the enquiry and for diagnostic purposes. Education and ageing, but not sex, appear to be significant factors in the efficiency of retrieval from the autobiographic repertoire.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":107},"references":23,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
