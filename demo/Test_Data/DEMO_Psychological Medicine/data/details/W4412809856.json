This study examines the associations of ACEs with functional impairment and life stress among military personnel, a population disproportionately affected by ACEs. We also evaluate the extent to which the associations of ACEs with functional outcomes are mediated through internalizing and externalizing disorders. Methods The sample included 4,666 STARRS Longitudinal Study (STARRS-LS) participants who provided information about ACEs upon enlistment in the US Army (2011–2012). Mental disorders were assessed in wave 1 (LS1; 2016–2018), and functional impairment and life stress were evaluated in wave 2 (LS2; 2018–2019) of STARRS-LS. Mediation analyses estimated the indirect associations of ACEs with physical health-related impairment, emotional health-related impairment, financial stress, and overall life stress at LS2 through internalizing and externalizing disorders at LS1. Results ACEs had significant indirect effects via mental disorders on all functional impairment and life stress outcomes, with internalizing disorders displaying stronger mediating effects than externalizing disorders (explaining 31–92% vs 5–15% of the total effects of ACEs, respectively). Additionally, ACEs exhibited significant direct effects on emotional health-related impairment, financial stress, and overall life stress, implying ACEs are also associated with these longer-term outcomes via alternative pathways. Conclusions This study indicates ACEs are linked to functional impairment and life stress among military personnel in part because of associated risks of mental disorders, particularly internalizing disorders. Consideration of ACEs should be incorporated into interventions to promote psychosocial functioning and resilience among military personnel.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":62,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
