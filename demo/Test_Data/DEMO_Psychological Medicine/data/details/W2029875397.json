A re-examination of this case after 15 years without significant psychotherapeutic intervention demonstrates a tendency towards remission. The view that multiple personality is a form of fugue, not necessarily hysterical, in which an alternative personality is adopted and that this behaviour is reinforced by the attention that it receives, is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":35},"references":35,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
