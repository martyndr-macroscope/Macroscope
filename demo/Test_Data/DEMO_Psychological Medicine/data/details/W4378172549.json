But its association with acylcarnitines remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess metabolomic profiles of 38 acylcarnitines in patients with major depression before and after treatment compared to healthy controls (HCs). Methods Metabolomic profiles of 38 plasma short-, medium-, and long-chain acylcarnitines were performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 893 HCs from the VARIETE cohort and 460 depressed patients from the METADAP cohort before and after 6 months of antidepressant treatment. Results As compared to HCs, depressed patients had lower levels of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines. After 6 months of treatment, increased levels of medium- and long-chain acyl-carnitines were observed that no longer differed from those of controls. Accordingly, several medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines were negatively correlated with depression severity. Conclusions These medium- and long-chain acylcarnitine dysregulations argue for mitochondrial dysfunction through fatty acid β -oxidation impairment during major depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":8},"references":46,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
