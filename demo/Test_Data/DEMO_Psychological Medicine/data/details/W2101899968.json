Mean prolactin level was elevated in 11 subjects (all six women and five of eight men). Mean plasma prolactin correlated significantly with mean plasma CPZ but not with the dose of the drug. Only patients with mean plasma prolactin above 35 ng/ml developed Parkinsonian side-effects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":45},"references":10,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
