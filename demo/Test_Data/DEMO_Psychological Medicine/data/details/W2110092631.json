The latency of the P3 component was significantly greater in the schizophrenic and bipolar subjects compared to other groups. The difference was stable with respect to clinical state at the time of testing and was not due to age differences or the effect of psychotropic medications. The results support the clinical distinction between bipolar and unipolar affective disorders, but also show that P3 change is not specific to schizophrenia and found in bipolar but not unipolar affective disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":116},"references":97,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
