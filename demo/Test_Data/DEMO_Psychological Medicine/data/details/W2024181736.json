Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multisystem neurobiological disorder with chronic alterations in various neurochemical systems. Levels of the GABA A – antagonistic neurosteroids plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate derivate, dehydro-epiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) may be relevant to depressive and anxiety disorders, including PTSD. Methods. We assessed the circulatory levels of morning plasma DHEA and DHEAS in 21 male out-patients with untreated chronic combat-related PTSD (CR-PTSD), and 18 healthy control male subjects. Results. Compared with the control subjects, the PTSD patients showed significantly higher plasma DHEA and DHEAS levels. Conclusions. Chronic CR-PTSD may be associated with increased circulatory level of neuroactive steroids with inhibitory activity at the GABA A receptors. Neurosteroid-induced decreased GABA-ergic tone may be relevant to the symptomatology and pathophysiology of chronic PTSD, as well as to the frequent co-morbidity of PTSD with depression and anxiety disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":130},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
