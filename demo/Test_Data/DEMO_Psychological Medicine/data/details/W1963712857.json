Consonant with previous research, three discrete groupings were found, namely dyskinetic movements of lips-jaw-tongue, limb-truncal and facial movements. These were then related to demographic, psychological and movement disorder variables. The limb-truncal, but neither the lips-jaw-tongue nor facial movements components, were associated with negative symptoms and cognitive impairment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":10},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
