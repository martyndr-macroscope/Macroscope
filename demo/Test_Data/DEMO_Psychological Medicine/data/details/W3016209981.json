We explored the vulnerable transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood to identify group trajectories and risk factors. Methods The National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth is a prospective representative cohort of Canadian children. We followed participants aged 7–11 years in 1994–95 to age 23 (2008–09). We modelled self-reported past-year suicide attempts (ages 12 to 23 years) using growth mixture models. We analysed risk factors from self- and parent-report questionnaires at pre-adolescence (ages 10–11) and early adolescence (ages 12–13) using multinomial logistic regressions. Analyses were adjusted for sample non-response and attrition. Results In 2233 participants answering questions on teen and adult suicide attempts, we identified three trajectories: never attempted (96.0%), adolescence-limited (2.0%) and persisting into adulthood (2.0%). Adolescent girls aged 12–13 with depression/anxiety symptoms, and with mothers experiencing depression had higher risks of adolescence-limited than never-attempted [relative risk RR 9.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.73–49.82); 2.03 (1.02–3.32), for each standard deviation increase; 1.07 (1.00–1.15); respectively]. Preteen ADHD symptoms increased the risk of attempts persisting into adulthood as compared to never-attempted [RR 2.05 (1.29–3.28) for each standard deviation increase]. Suicide death of schoolmate/acquaintance increased risks of an adulthood trajectory as compared to never-attempted and adolescence-limited [RR 8.41 (3.04–23.27) and 6.63 (1.29–34.06), respectively]. Conclusion In half the participants attempting suicide, attempts continued into adulthood. We stress the need for preventive strategies in early adolescence and differential clinical/educational interventions as identified for each trajectory.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":47},"references":64,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
