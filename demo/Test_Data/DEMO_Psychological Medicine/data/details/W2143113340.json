With common reference recording and a visual imagery task it increases in healthy right-handers and neurotic patients, and it decreases in healthy left-handers and schizophrenic patients. It is suggested that this implies a less lateralized brain organization in schizophrenia which may account for the often reported association with left-handedness. When associated with impaired corpus callosum transmission, it may contribute to the disturbed behaviour and thought processes in this condition.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":39},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
