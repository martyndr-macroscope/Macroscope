Of these patients 228 were interviewed with the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, giving Research Diagnostic Criteria for psychiatric disorders. The experience of severe social adversity (provoking agents) had a significant association with psychiatric disorder at 2 months (odds ratio = 5·3) and 6 months (odds ratio = 5·8) after onset of infection. This association was especially significant for depressive illness (odds ratio = 9·1 at 2 months and 11·9 at 6 months). In contrast, social adversity had little association with the development of the post-infectious fatigue syndrome, or delayed physical recovery. Social adversity may be an important maintaining factor for psychiatric disorders, especially depressive illness, following acute infections.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":42},"references":35,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
