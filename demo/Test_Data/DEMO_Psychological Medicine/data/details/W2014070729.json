An opiate antagonist, naloxone 1·6 mg, and placebo were administered in a double-blind, crossover design to 13 constantly hallucinating schizophrenic patients. Naloxone was found to be no different from placebo in its effect.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":7},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
