A study is described measuring changes in intent with repetition by means of an intent scale. Patients repeating once in 5 years scored significantly higher in intent for their second episodes, while multiple repeaters tended to score lower for second episodes. Patients under the age of 35 were most at risk for repetition with increasing intent within 2 years. No correlation emerged between the rise in intent and the time interval between episodes over a 7-year period. The 5-year suicide rate was higher among rising intent repeaters than other cases. These findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":27},"references":25,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
