Patients who present overt psychological symptoms suffer more psychiatric distress and have more abnormal attachment than those presenting physical symptoms (either organically explained or unexplained). Models to explain these findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":100},"references":15,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
