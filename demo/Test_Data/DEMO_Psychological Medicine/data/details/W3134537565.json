We develop an ITR for depression remission based on secondary analysis of a recently published trial for second-line antidepression medication selection using a cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method. Methods Data come from the SUN(^_^)D trial, an open-label, assessor blinded pragmatic trial of previously-untreated patients with major depressive disorder from 48 clinics in Japan. Initial clinic-level randomization assigned patients to 50 or 100 mg/day sertraline. We focus on the 1549 patients who failed to remit within 3 weeks and were then rerandomized at the individual-level to continuation with sertraline, switching to mirtazapine, or combining mirtazapine with sertraline. The outcome was remission 9 weeks post-baseline. Predictors included socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, baseline symptoms, changes in symptoms between baseline and week 3, and week 3 side effects. Results Optimized treatment was associated with significantly increased cross-validated week 9 remission rates in both samples [5.3% (2.4%), p = 0.016 50 mg/day sample; 5.1% (2.7%), p = 0.031 100 mg/day sample] compared to randomization (30.1–30.8%). Optimization was also associated with significantly increased remission in both samples compared to continuation [24.7% in both: 11.2% (3.8%), p = 0.002 50 mg/day sample; 11.7% (3.9%), p = 0.001 100 mg/day sample]. Non-significant gains were found for optimization compared to switching or combining. Conclusions An ITR can be developed to improve second-line antidepressant selection, but replication in a larger study with more comprehensive baseline predictors might produce stronger and more stable results.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":13},"references":60,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
