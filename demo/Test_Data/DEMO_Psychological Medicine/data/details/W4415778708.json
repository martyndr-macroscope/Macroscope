We argue that much of the apparent increase relies on self-report data, and thus may reflect heightened awareness of mental problems in youth themselves. Long-term epidemiological studies indicate relative stability or even decline until the COVID-19 pandemic, after which rates of anxiety and depression rose sharply. At the same time, indicators of youth development – including reduced school drop-out, unemployment, delinquency, and adversity – suggest more positive trajectories than the crisis narrative implies. We call for a shift beyond the disorder–distress dichotomy, recognizing the increased visibility and vocalization of emotional difficulties among adolescents as a positive sign, potentially reflecting adaptive coping rather than pathology. Such reframing will steer novel solutions that focus on promoting well-being and understanding what keeps youth healthy, rather than just treating illness.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":25,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
