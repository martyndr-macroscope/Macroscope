This involved applying a series of analyses to speech produced when describing pictures in an unconstrained way. The results showed that, for the most part, positive symptom schizophrenics organized their speech, both within and between ideas, as well as negative symptom schizophrenics and normals. The results did, however, show an increased tendency by the positive speech disordered schizophrenics to omit referents for noun phrases requiring referents. This constitutes a specific failure to connect ideas and does, at least in part, explain what makes positive speech disorder (incoherence of speech) unintelligible. However, taken altogether, the results do not support the extant view that positive symptom schizophrenics suffer from a general loss of control in producing speech.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":37},"references":44,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
