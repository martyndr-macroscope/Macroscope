It is argued that research workers should analyse data from cross-over trials for asymmetries due to order of treatment and seriously doubt the reliability of data if such effects are found. The problem is avoided by the use of separate-groups designs.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":15},"references":29,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
