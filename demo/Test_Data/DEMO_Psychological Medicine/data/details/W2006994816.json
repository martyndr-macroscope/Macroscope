E. A. and N. Tinbergens' ethological theory of the aetiology of this syndrome is outlined and criticized. The major problem in evaluating this theory, apart from the absence of any evidence in its favour, is the lack of precision with which the Tinbergens use the terms ‘autism’ and ‘Kanner's syndrome’.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":14},"references":72,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
