Self and independent assessment at the end of treatment showed the directive significantly superior to the control procedure on several measures. This superiority was maintained to 18 months' follow-up, when the interpretative procedure also showed some superiority over the control.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":136},"references":28,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
