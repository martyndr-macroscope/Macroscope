The necessarily non-statistical component of any inference is noted, and the area where one might hope for an exact statistical inference is identified. A class of tests permitting such inferences is described. Their theoretical and practical advantages are outlined.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":9,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
