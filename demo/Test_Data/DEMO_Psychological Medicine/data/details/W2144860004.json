Patients referred by consultant psychiatrists in the Inner London Area were carefully selected and fully assessed before random allocation to one of three treatment procedures. The results indicate that the trial as initially envisaged is not feasible. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":39},"references":25,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
