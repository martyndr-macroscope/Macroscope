Little is known about the interaction of life events with prodromal symptoms in bulimia nervosa. Methods. A semistructured research interview based on Paykel's Interview for Recent Life Events and on the Clinical Interview for Depression for eliciting prodromal symptoms was administered to 30 patients with bulimia nervosa and 30 healthy control subjects matched for sociodemographic variables. Results. Patients reported significantly more stressful life events than controls. Most of the patients reported prodromal symptoms. Anorexia, low self-esteem, depressed mood, anhedonia, generalized anxiety and irritability were the most common prodromal symptoms. Conclusions. The prodromal phase of bulimia nervosa was found to be characterized by a combination of prodromal symptoms of affective type and stressful life events. Their joint occurrence may increase vulnerability to bulimia nervosa.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":52},"references":23,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
