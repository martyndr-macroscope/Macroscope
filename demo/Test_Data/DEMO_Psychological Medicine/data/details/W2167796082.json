These figures were extrapolated, and a Republic of Ireland minimum true rate of suicide was computed which was 3 times greater than the official reported rate. Irish suicide data were found not to be dependent on coroners' reports as is commonly believed. It is concluded that under-reporting reduces Irish suicide rates to a far greater extent than has been supposed. The substitution of clinical for legalistic methods of recording suicide data is recommended.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":53},"references":30,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
