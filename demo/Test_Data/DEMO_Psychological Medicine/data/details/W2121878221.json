The patients were impaired on tasks of free and cued recall, but exhibited normal performance on a word-completion procedure similar to that used by Graf et al. (1984). Reasons for the discrepancy between these findings and those from related research which reports impairment of word completion in patients with Alzheimer's Disease are discussed. Of particular interest is the role the orientating task plays in word-completion performance.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":51},"references":49,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
