Methods Twenty-two NC participants and 18 OC users reported daily affective and physical symptoms and collected daily salivary samples across 28 days. Groups were compared using psychological well-being averages (linear mixed models), day-to-day variability (Levene’s test), and network models. Within NC participants, cycle phase effects and time-varying associations between hormones and psychological well-being were assessed using both person-centered mean and change (subtracting mean from daily score) scores. Results Lowered variability was found for OC users’ agitation, risk-taking, attractiveness, and energy levels. They showed lower overall ratings of happiness, attractiveness, risk-taking, and energy levels (range R 2 m = .004: .019) but also reported more relaxation, sexual desire, and better sleep quality (range R 2 m = .005; .01) compared to the NC group. The impact of sex hormones on psychological well-being varied significantly across cycle phases, with the largest effects for progesterone levels. Conclusions Our results confirm that hormonal status is associated with a range of psychological well-being domains beyond mood and sexual desire, including energy levels, feelings of attractiveness, risk taking, and agitation. Lowered variability in OC users versus NC participants fit with ‘emotional blunting’ as a possible mechanism behind OC’s side effects. Our findings that show the menstrual cycle and sex hormones differentially influenced markers of psychological well-being emphasize the need to adequately account for the menstrual cycle.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":100,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
