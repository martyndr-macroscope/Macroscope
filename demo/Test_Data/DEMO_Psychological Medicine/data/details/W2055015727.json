This was assessed in a double blind cross-over trial with placebo. The effect was of no therapeutic value. No difference was found between the depressive patients and a control group of normal subjects in TSH response, T 3 resin uptake, T 4 or free thyroxine index values as a consequence of the TRH infusion.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":19},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
