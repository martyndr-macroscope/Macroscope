The mood induced modulation of verbal fluency induced activations is consistent with resting state findings of decreased function in these regions in depressed patients. The present data suggest that resting state rCBF profile may represent the modulation of spontaneous activity in this network by a core system that is dysfunctional in depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":234},"references":30,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
