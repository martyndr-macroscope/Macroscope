An account is given of the development of a psychiatric screening questionnaire suitable for use in Chinese community samples. The questionnaire was derived from a Chinese translation of the General Health Questionnaire, with the addition of specially designed, culturally-relevant items. Discriminant function analysis was then used to select a subset of 12 items which discriminated well between ‘cases’ and ‘normals’ in the community.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":299},"references":24,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
