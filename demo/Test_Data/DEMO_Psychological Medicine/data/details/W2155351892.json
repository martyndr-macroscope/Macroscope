Sixteen women were equally improved on placebo and oestrogen. Only 2 patients had an improved sense of well-being on oestrogen and not on placebo. The psychological diagnosis was unrelated to the subjective response to oestrogen or placebo. Performance in psychological tests administered before and during treatment periods was not changed by oestrogen or placebo.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":62},"references":18,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
