The point-prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was 31 % which compares closely with that of patients attending a general practitioner's surgery who were assessed by the same method. The 10 patients who were psychiatrically ill had more organic symptoms and their spouses were less able to tolerate RDT in the home.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":41},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
