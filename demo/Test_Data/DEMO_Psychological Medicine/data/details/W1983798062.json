Similarly, the two rates were found to be correlated across the city wards in 1971 ( r = 0·76) and even more strongly in 1981 ( r = 0·95). Throughout the period the parasuicide rate among the unemployed was nearly always more than 10 times higher than that among the employed. The long-term unemployed were at much higher risk than those out of work for lesser periods, although the impact of recent job loss was marked. Population attributable risk has shown a tendency to rise in line with the upward trend in the unemployment rate, despite the decline in relative risk over the period. The findings were considered consistent with the view that unemployment increases the parasuicide rate.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":88},"references":25,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
