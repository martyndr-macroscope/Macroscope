Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, but there are gaps in current knowledge about CBT in the primary care context, especially with regard to long-term effects and the efficacy of specific delivery formats. This is an obstacle to the integration of primary care and specialist psychiatry. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of CBT for primary care patients with depression to investigate the effect of CBT for patients with depression in primary care. A total of 34 studies, with 2543 patients in CBT and 2815 patients in control conditions, were included. CBT was more effective than the control conditions [ g = 0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15–0.30)], and the effect was sustained at follow-up [ g = 0.17 (95% CI 0.10–0.24)]. CBT also led to a higher response rate [odds ratio (OR) = 2.47 (95% CI 1.60–3.80)] and remission rate [OR = 1.56 (95% CI 1.15–2.14)] than the control conditions. Heterogeneity was moderate. The controlled effect of CBT was significant regardless of whether patients met diagnostic criteria for depression, scored above a validated cut-off for depression, or merely had depressive symptoms. CBT also had a controlled effect regardless of whether the treatment was delivered as individual therapy, group therapy or therapist-guided self-help. We conclude that CBT appears to be effective for patients with depression in primary care, and recommend that patients with mild to moderate depression be offered CBT in primary care.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":98},"references":67,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
