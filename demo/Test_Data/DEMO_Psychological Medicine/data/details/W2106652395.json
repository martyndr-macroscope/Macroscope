The clients were assessed to establish their level of general functioning, the comparison indicating there was no significant difference between the two groups on the measure used. A previously published protocol was used as a method of comparing the units. The findings indicated that the hospital unit was more individually orientated both in practices and staff attitudes, and had staff who were more optimistic about clients' potential accomplishments. No differences were found between perceived involvement of staff in decision making, or staff–resident interactions. These findings have implications for the ‘Care in the Community’ movement, as they indicate that the nature of a service is as important as its location. They suggest that the relocation of services to the community in itself will not automatically overcome some of the difficulties associated with institutional care.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":17},"references":25,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
