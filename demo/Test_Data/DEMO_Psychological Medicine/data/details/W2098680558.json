The rate of suicide among psychiatric in-patients was over 50 times that in the general population. A higher vulnerability to suicide was detected among in-patients ( v. other patient groups), men ( v. women) and middle-aged patients ( v. older and younger patients). Suicides were differentiated from controls in having suffered more losses ( P &lt; 0·05), being psychiatrically ill for the first time ( P &lt; 0·05), having a past history of deliberate self-harm ( P &lt; 0·05), and not receiving a schizophrenic diagnosis ( P &lt; 0·02). People with mid-life crises, patients who swing rapidly into depression while receiving treatment, and individuals who are judged to be depressed because of personal problems may carry a particularly high suicide risk during psychiatric treatment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":41},"references":49,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
