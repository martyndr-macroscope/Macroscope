Results indicate that patients diagnosed as schizophrenic on the basis of standardized assessments and clearly specified diagnostic criteria demonstrated very marked variations of course and outcome over a 2-year period. Schizophrenic patients in the centres in developing countries had considerably better course and outcome than schizophrenic patients in the centres in developed countries.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":147},"references":5,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
