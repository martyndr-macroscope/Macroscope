Dynamical systems theory has proposed that rises in certain ‘early warning signals’ (EWSs) in time-series data (e.g. auto-correlation, temporal variance, network connectivity) may precede impending changes in disorder severity. The current study investigates whether rises in these EWSs over time are associated with future changes in disorder severity among a group of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods Thirty-one patients with MDD completed the study, which consisted of daily smartphone-delivered surveys over 8 weeks. Daily positive and negative affect were collected for the time-series analyses. A rolling window approach was used to determine whether rises in auto-correlation of total affect, temporal standard deviation of total affect, and overall network connectivity in individual affect items were predictive of increases in depression symptoms. Results Results suggested that rises in auto-correlation were significantly associated with worsening in depression symptoms ( r = 0.41, p = 0.02). Results indicated that neither rises in temporal standard deviation ( r = −0.23, p = 0.23) nor in network connectivity ( r = −0.12, p = 0.59) were associated with changes in depression symptoms. Conclusions This study more rigorously examines whether rises in EWSs were associated with future depression symptoms in a larger group of patients with MDD. Results indicated that rises in auto-correlation were the only EWS that was associated with worsening future changes in depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":23},"references":38,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
