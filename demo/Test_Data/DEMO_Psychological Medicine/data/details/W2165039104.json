The Endstage Renal Disease Severity Index (ESRD-SI) was developed for these purposes during a prospective study of patient adjustment to dialysis and endstage renal disease (ESRD). It was found to have adequate inter-rater reliability, test–retest reliability, and construct and predictive validity in two subsamples (total N = 233) of dialysis patients. The ESRD-SI is suitable as a sensitive indicator of disease severity in these patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":67},"references":25,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
