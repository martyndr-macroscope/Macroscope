However, previous research syntheses addressing the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on RNT are limited to specific diagnoses, treatments, or RNT constructs (transdiagnostic RNT, worry, rumination). In the present meta-analysis, we integrate findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT on RNT across diagnoses, intervention types, and RNT constructs. We investigate the following questions: What is the overall transdiagnostic efficacy of CBT interventions on all post-treatment RNT outcomes? Which RNT construct is addressed most effectively? Are RNT-specific treatments superior in reducing RNT than less specific approaches? Inclusion criteria were met by 55 studies with a total of 4,970 participants. The overall post-treatment effect of CBT interventions on RNT compared to respective control groups was moderate in favor of CBT ( g = −0.67). Treatment efficacy did not differ significantly by RNT construct. RNT-specific interventions ( g = −0.99) were significantly more efficacious in reducing RNT than less specific approaches ( g = −0.56). Treatment efficacy was not significantly enhanced by individual or in-person settings. Our results advocate a dissemination of RNT-specific treatments in research and practice and a general improvement of CBT treatments by focusing on relevant transdiagnostic processes such as RNT.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":77,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
