The two factor structure of the instrument was confirmed, as well as the high stability of its scales over time. Respondents who had had children differed significantly from others. No association was found between social desirability, neuroticism or extraversion and either of the scales. No association was observed between the scales and psychiatric disorder, despite using covariance structure analysis to remove the effects of age and attenuation due to measurement error. Estimates of relative risk for affectionless control were low in contrast to estimates calculated from samples with psychiatric disorders. These findings may be characteristic of symptomatic persons in a general population. Because of the importance of the affectionless control construct, the findings invite further investigation in other community and treated samples.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":142},"references":29,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
