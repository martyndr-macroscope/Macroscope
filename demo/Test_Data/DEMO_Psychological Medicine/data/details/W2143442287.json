The results indicated high overall agreement when the schedule was repeated over time, and also when used by several trained interviewers to rate the same interview. Problems arising from the use of such interview schedules are discussed, and suggestions are made for improving the design and method of administration.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":265},"references":8,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
