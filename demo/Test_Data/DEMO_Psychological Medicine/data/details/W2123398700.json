The doctors were studied individually in their consulting rooms or offices. In relation to the methods of analysis chosen, levels of agreement within and between the two groups of trainees were generally low. The findings are discussed in relation to previous similar work undertaken with experienced clinicians studied in groups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":9},"references":29,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
