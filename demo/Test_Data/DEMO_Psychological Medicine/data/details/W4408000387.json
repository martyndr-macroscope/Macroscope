Evidence suggests that brain state can modulate the brain’s response to stimulation, potentially diminishing antidepressant efficacy if left uncontrolled or enhancing it with inexpensive psychological or other non-pharmacological methods. Thus, we conducted a PRISMA-ScR-based scoping review to pool studies administering rTMS with psychological and other non-pharmacological methods. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 10 July 2024. Inclusion criteria: neuropsychiatric patients underwent rTMS; studies assessed depressive symptom severity; non-pharmacological tasks or interventions were administered during rTMS, or did not include a wash-out period. Of 8,442 studies, 20 combined rTMS with aerobic exercise, bright light therapy, cognitive training or reactivation, psychotherapy, sleep deprivation, or a psychophysical task. Meta-analyses using random effects models were conducted based on change scores on standardized scales. The effect size was large and therapeutic for uncontrolled pretest-posttest comparisons (17 studies, Hedges’ g = −1.91, (standard error) SE = 0.45, 95% (confidence interval) CI = −2.80 to −1.03, p &lt; 0.01); medium when studies compared active combinations with sham rTMS plus active non-pharmacological methods (8 studies, g = −0.55, SE = 0.14, 95% CI = −0.82 to −0.28, p &lt; 0.01); and non-significant when active combinations were compared with active rTMS plus sham psychological methods (4 studies, p = 0.96). Attempts to administer rTMS with non-pharmacological methods show promise but have not yet outperformed rTMS alone.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":63,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
