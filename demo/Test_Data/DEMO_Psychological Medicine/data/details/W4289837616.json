Scar models posit the reverse association. However, most studies that tested relationships between non-specific immune/endocrine markers and depression did not separate temporal inferences between people and within-person and how different immunometabolism markers related to unique depression symptoms. We thus used cross-lagged prospective network analyses (CLPN) to investigate this topic. Methods Community midlife women ( n = 2224) completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale and provided biomarker samples across five time-points spanning 9 years. CLPN identified significant relations ( edges ) among components ( nodes ) of depression (depressed mood, somatic symptoms, interpersonal issues), lipid markers [insulin, fasting glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL)], and proinflammatory proteins [C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen], within and across time-points. All models adjusted for age, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, and menopausal status. Results In within-person temporal networks, higher CRP and HDL predicted all three depression components ( d = 0.131–2.112). Increased LDL preceded higher depressed mood and interpersonal issues ( v. somatic symptoms) ( d = 0.251–0.327). Elevated triglycerides predicted more somatic symptoms ( v. depressed mood and interpersonal problems) ( d = 0.131). More interpersonal problems forecasted elevated fibrinogen and LDL levels ( d = 0.129–0.331), and stronger somatic symptoms preceded higher fibrinogen levels ( d = 0.188). Conclusions Results supported both vulnerability and scar models. Long-term dysregulated immunometabolism systems, social disengagement, and related patterns are possible mechanistic accounts. Cognitive-behavioral therapies that optimize nutrition and physical activity may effectively target depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":23},"references":117,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
