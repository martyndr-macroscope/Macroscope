We evaluate the influence of schizophrenia family history on clinical outcomes of EDs. Methods We conducted a cohort evaluation of the association between family history of schizophrenia and ED clinical features, psychiatric comorbidities, and somatic and mental health burden in individuals born in Sweden 1977–2003 with anorexia nervosa (AN) or other EDs (OED: bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and ED not otherwise specified). Results Of 12 424 individuals with AN and 20 716 individuals with OED, 599 (4.8%) and 1118 (5.4%), respectively, had a family history of schizophrenia (in up to third-degree relatives). Among individuals with AN, schizophrenia in first-degree relatives was significantly associated with increased comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [HR(95% CI) 2.26 (1.27–3.99)], substance abuse disorder (SUD) [HR (95% CI) 1.93 (1.25–2.98)], and anxiety disorders [HR (95% CI) 1.47 (1.08–2.01)], but higher lowest illness-associated body mass index (BMI) [1.14 kg/m 2 , 95% CI (0.19–2.10)]. Schizophrenia in any relative (up to third-degree) in AN was significantly associated with higher somatic and mental health burden, but lower ED psychopathology scores [−0.29, 95% CI (−0.54 to −0.04)]. Schizophrenia in first-degree relatives in individuals with OED was significantly associated with increased comorbid ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, SUD, anxiety disorders, somatic and mental health burden, and suicide attempts. Conclusions We observed different patterns of ED-related outcomes, psychiatric comorbidity, and illness burden in individuals with EDs with and without family histories of schizophrenia and provide new insights into the diverse manifestations of EDs.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":31},"references":33,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
