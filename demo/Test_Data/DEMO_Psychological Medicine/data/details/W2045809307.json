The following suicide rates (per 100000 of the population per annum) were found: 7·4 for all races; 11·3 for men of all races; 3·0 for women of all races; 6·9 for all African residents; 11·2 for African males; 2·2 for African females; 12·8 for all Africans above the age of 14 years; 20·9 for all European residents; 20·7 for all European males; 21·0 for all European females. The male: female ratio among the Africans was 5:1. There was a tendency for the suicide rate among the Africans to rise with age. Differences in suicide rates between African and European residents were found not to be statistically significant. Though hanging was by far the most commonly used method of suicide by Africans, Europeans and ‘doubtful suicides’ among Africans preferred other methods to a statistically significant degree. It is suggested that the role of other methods in African suicides may well have been underestimated in the past. No definite seasonal variation in suicide rates was found. Domestic quarrels, mental illness and physical diseases would appear to be some of the important precipitating factors of suicide in Lusaka. It is also suggested that the question of whether or not suicide is rare in Africans cannot be answered until such time as when reliable figures are available in Africa.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":21},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
