We tested the hypothesis that a syndrome of despair-related maladies at midlife is preceded by psychopathology during adolescence. Methods Participants are members of a representative cohort of 1037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972–73 and followed to age 45 years, with 94% retention. Adolescent mental disorders were assessed in three diagnostic assessments at ages 11, 13, and 15 years. Indicators of despair-related maladies across four domains – suicidality, substance misuse, sleep problems, and pain – were assessed at age 45 using multi-modal measures including self-report, informant-report, and national register data. Results We identified and validated a syndrome of despair-related maladies at midlife involving suicidality, substance misuse, sleep problems, and pain. Adults who exhibited a more severe syndrome of despair-related maladies at midlife tended to have had early-onset emotional and behavioral disorders [ β = 0.23, 95% CI (0.16–0.30), p &lt; 0.001], even after adjusting for sex, childhood SES, and childhood IQ. A more pronounced midlife despair syndrome was observed among adults who, as adolescents, were diagnosed with a greater number of mental disorders [ β = 0.26, 95% CI (0.19–0.33), p &lt; 0.001]. Tests of diagnostic specificity revealed that associations generalized across different adolescent mental disorders. Conclusions Midlife adults who exhibited a more severe syndrome of despair-related maladies tended to have had psychopathology as adolescents. Prevention and treatment of adolescent psychopathology may mitigate despair-related maladies at midlife and ultimately reduce deaths of despair.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":9},"references":79,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
