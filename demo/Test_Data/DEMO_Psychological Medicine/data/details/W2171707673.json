Blood samples were taken at intervals after the injection of soluble insulin (0·1 U/kg body weight). The growth hormone response was impaired in 4 of the alcoholics and the depression was not related to differences in blood glucose or plasma free fatty acids. The Cortisol response was also impaired in the alcoholics. We conclude that alcoholics observed after alcohol withdrawal may have a depression of hypothalamic/pituitary function.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":23},"references":21,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
