Although despair- and cardiometabolic-related mortality are increasing concurrently, it is unclear whether they share common developmental origins. We tested adolescent psychopathology as a potential common origin of midlife diseases of despair and cardiometabolic risk. Methods Participants ( N = 4578) were from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a nationally representative cohort followed from adolescence to early midlife. Adolescent psychopathology included depression, anxiety, eating disorders, PTSD, conduct disorder, and ADHD at ages 11–18. Diseases of despair (suicidality, substance misuse, pain, and sleep problems) and cardiometabolic risk (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, high-risk waist circumference, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions) were multi-modally measured at ages 33–43. Results At midlife, adolescents who experienced psychopathology exhibited more indicators of despair-related diseases and cardiometabolic risk (IRRs = 1.67 [1.46–1.87] and 1.13 [1.04–1.21], respectively), even after accounting for demographics, adolescent SES, and adolescent cognitive ability. Associations were evident for internalizing and externalizing conditions, and in a dose–response fashion. In mediation analyses, low education explained little of these associations, but early-adult substance use explained 21.5% of psychopathology's association with despair-related diseases. Midlife despair-related diseases and cardiometabolic risk co-occurred within individuals (IRR = 1.12 [1.08–1.16]). Adolescent psychopathology accounted for 8.3% of this co-occurrence, and 16.7% together with adolescent SES and cognitive ability. Conclusions Adolescent psychopathology precedes both diseases of despair and cardiometabolic risk. Prevention and treatment of psychopathology may mitigate multiple causes of poor midlife health, reducing premature mortality.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":58,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
