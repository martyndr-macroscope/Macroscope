Ultra-brief treatments overcome some of these barriers by delivering therapeutic information and skills using significantly less time than standard-length treatments. We developed a therapist-guided online ultra-brief treatment for depression and anxiety and compared it to an existing 8-week, 5-lesson therapist-guided standard-length treatment and a waitlist control. Methods In a randomized controlled trial, adults with self-reported depression or anxiety were randomized (1:1:1) to the ultra-brief treatment, standard-length treatment, or waitlist control. The primary outcomes were depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms assessed at baseline, 5-weeks later, 9-weeks later (primary timepoint), and 3-months later. The trial was prospectively registered. Results Between 7 February 2022, and 16 August 2022, 242 participants were enrolled in the ultra-brief treatment ( n = 85), standard-length treatment ( n = 80), and waitlist control ( n = 77). Participants were mostly women with an average age of 48.56 years. At 9-weeks post-baseline, participants in the ultra-brief treatment group reported significantly lower depression (between groups d = 0.41) and anxiety ( d = 0.53) than the waitlist control. The ultra-brief treatment was non-inferior for anxiety at both 9-weeks and 3-months follow-up. Non-inferiority for depression was observed at 9-weeks. Conclusions The online ultra-brief treatment resulted in significant reductions in depression and anxiety that were non-inferior to a longer treatment course after 9-weeks. Remotely delivered ultra-brief treatments have the potential to provide accessible and effective care for those who cannot, or would prefer not to, access longer psychological interventions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":20},"references":56,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
