Data concerning the cohort were compared with inter- and intra-generational mobility in a random Dutch sample. The results indicate that the educational and occupational mobility of patients, relative to their fathers, was greater than expected. Although patients were better educated than the random sample, they fared less well occupationally. An analysis of patterns of occupational mobility before and after the onset of psychosis also showed that social selection played a major role in achieving social status. The outcome of patients' occupational career at follow-up was poor, and only a minority succeeded in obtaining or keeping a regular job.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":146},"references":29,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
