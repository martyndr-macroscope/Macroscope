Results showed that the hostel was able to maintain 9 of the 10 initially transferred patients and has been able to provide some improvements in their quality of life. However, unlike highly staffed hospital-hostels, it was not able to decrease patients' disabilities. Implications of this are discussed in relation to staffing levels and practices.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":18},"references":23,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
