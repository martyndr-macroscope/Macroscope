However, few have used analytic strategies that capture the interplay of these experiences and their relation to PTSD. The current study used a person-centered statistical approach to examine heterogeneity in trauma and contextual stress exposure, and their associations with PTSD and underlying symptom dimensions, in a diverse sample of low-income postpartum women. Methods Using a community-based sample of Black, Hispanic/Latina, and White postpartum women recruited from five U.S. regions ( n = 1577), a latent class analysis generated profiles of past-year exposure to traumatic events and contextual stress at one month postpartum. Regression analyses then examined associations between class membership and PTSD symptom severity at six months postpartum as a function of race/ethnicity. Results A four-class solution best fit the data, yielding High Contextual Stress, Injury/Illness, Violence Exposure, and Low Trauma/Contextual Stress classes. Compared to the Low Trauma/Contextual Stress class, membership in any of the other classes was associated with greater symptom severity across nearly all PTSD symptom dimensions (all ps &lt; 0.05). Additionally, constellations of exposures were differentially linked to total PTSD symptom severity, reexperiencing, and numbing PTSD symptoms across racial/ethnic groups ( ps &lt; 0.05). Conclusions A person-centered approach to trauma and contextual stress exposure can capture heterogeneity of experiences in diverse, low-income women. Moreover, racially/ethnically patterned links between traumatic or stressful exposures and PTSD symptom dimensions have implications for screening and intervention in the perinatal period.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":57,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
