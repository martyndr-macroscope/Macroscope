We investigated the issue in a cohort of 131 schizophrenic patients. We found non-users ( N = 67) were similar to pathological users ( N = 64) in current symptomatology and clinical history. The pathological users did, however, have better pre-morbid adjustment levels. Only alcohol use and to some extent cannabis use contributed to this effect; use of stimulants or hallucinogens did not. These results indicate the importance of evaluating the various types of substance used when attempting to explore the significance of co-morbidity. The results also suggest that co-morbidity of substance abuse and schizophrenia may be explained by a common factor antecedent to both: better pre-morbid adjustment. A two-stage model is proposed to explain these findings: increased sociability increases exposure to opportunities of substance use in a subset of patients; subsequent onset of psychotic illness accelerates the use to a pathological level as the individual attempts to cope with the stress of the developing mental illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":191},"references":53,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
