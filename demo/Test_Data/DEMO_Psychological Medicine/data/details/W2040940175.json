A number of significant differences were found, especially with respect to age and duration of illness, previous treatment failures, and long-term outcome. The results appear to support the authors' view that the staic idea of anorexia nervosa as a unitary illness should be abandoned and replaced by a dynamic dimensional model according to which, in the course of time, changes may occur in the clinical picture of dysorectic patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":69},"references":29,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
