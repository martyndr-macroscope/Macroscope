We aimed to evaluate the potential causal relationship of MDD with 4 GID [gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)] using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Methods We obtained genome-wide association data for MDD from a meta-analysis ( N = 480 359), and for GID from the UK Biobank ( N ranges: 332 601–486 601) and FinnGen ( N ranges: 187 028–218 792) among individuals of European ancestry. Our primary method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR, with a series of sensitivity analyses to test the hypothesis of MR. Individual study estimates were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Results Meta-analyses IVW MR found evidence that genetically predicted MDD may increase the risk of GERD, IBS, PUD and NAFLD. Additionally, reverse MR found evidence of genetically predicted GERD or IBS may increase the risk of MDD. Conclusions Genetically predicted MDD may increase the risk of GERD, IBS, PUD and NAFLD. Genetically predicted GERD or IBS may increase the risk of MDD. The findings may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the co-morbidity of MDD and GID. Focusing on GID symptoms in patients with MDD and emotional problems in patients with GID is important for the clinical management.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":35},"references":87,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
