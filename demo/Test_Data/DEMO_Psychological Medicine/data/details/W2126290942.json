Cognitive therapy reduces depressive symptoms of major depressive disorder, but little is known about concomitant reduction in social-interpersonal dysfunction. Method. We evaluated social-interpersonal functioning (self-reported social adjustment, interpersonal problems and dyadic adjustment) and depressive symptoms (two self-report and two clinician scales) in adult outpatients ( n =156) with recurrent major depressive disorder at several points during a 20-session course of acute phase cognitive therapy. Consenting acute phase responders ( n =84) entered a 2-year follow-up phase, which included an 8-month experimental trial comparing continuation phase cognitive therapy to assessment-only control. Results. Social-interpersonal functioning improved after acute phase cognitive therapy (dyadic adjustment d =0·47; interpersonal problems d =0·91; social adjustment d =1·19), but less so than depressive symptoms ( d =1·55). Improvement in depressive symptoms and social-interpersonal functioning were moderately to highly correlated ( r =0·39–0·72). Improvement in depressive symptoms was partly independent of social-interpersonal functioning ( r =0·55–0·81), but improvement in social-interpersonal functioning independent of change in depressive symptoms was not significant ( r =0·01–0·06). In acute phase responders, continuation phase therapy did not further enhance social-interpersonal functioning, but improvements in social-interpersonal functioning were maintained through the follow-up. Conclusions. Social-interpersonal functioning is improved after acute phase cognitive therapy and maintained in responders over 2 years. Improvement in social-interpersonal functioning is largely accounted for by decreases in depressive symptoms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":67},"references":68,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
