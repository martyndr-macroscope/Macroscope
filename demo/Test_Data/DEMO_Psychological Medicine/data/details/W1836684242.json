Effect of cannabis use on memory function is a contentious issue, with effects being different in healthy individuals and patients with psychosis. Method. Employing a meta-analytic approach we investigated the effects of cannabis use on memory function in patients with psychosis and healthy individuals, and the effect of diagnosis, memory dimension and moderating factors. A total of 88 studies were identified through a systematic literature search, investigating healthy ( n = 7697) and psychotic ( n = 3261) individuals. Standardized mean differences between the cannabis user and non-user groups on memory tasks were estimated using random-effects models and the effect-size statistic Cohen's d . Effects of potential moderating factors were tested using mixed-effects models and subgroup analyses. Results. We found that cannabis use was associated with significantly ( p ⩽ 0.05) impaired global ( d = 0.27) and prospective memory ( d = 0.61), verbal immediate ( d = 0.40) and delayed ( d = 0.36) recall as well as visual recognition ( d = 0.41) in healthy individuals, but a better global memory ( d = −0.11), visual immediate recall ( d = −0.73) and recognition ( d = −0.42) in patients. Lower depression scores and younger age appeared to attenuate the effects of cannabis on memory. Cannabis-using patients had lower levels of depression and were younger compared with non-using patients, whilst healthy cannabis-users had higher depression scores than age-matched non-users. Longer duration of abstinence from cannabis reduced the effects on memory in healthy and patient users. Conclusions. These results suggest that cannabis use is associated with a significant domain-specific impairment in memory in healthy individuals but not in cannabis-using patients, suggesting that they may represent a less developmentally impaired subgroup of psychotic patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":91},"references":90,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
