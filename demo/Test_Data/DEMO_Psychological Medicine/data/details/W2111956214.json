Psychiatric diagnoses were found to be relatively common. Of the young adolescents who received a psychiatric diagnosis (almost one in ten of the group), 38% received a psychiatric diagnosis as young adults compared with only 16% of the remainder. Comorbidity was found to be very common – over 50% of young adults with a diagnosis of depression also had a diagnosis of anxiety and phobic neuroses. Young people with problems of a psychological nature therefore deserve more attention, particularly from the primary care team.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":7},"references":26,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
