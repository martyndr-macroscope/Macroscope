A method is described (and developed mathematically in an appendix) which enables a choice to be made between a triggering effect in which events are seen as precipitating an illness that would probably have occurred before long for other reasons, and a formative effect in which life-events either substantially advance onset in time, or bring it about altogether. The method is used to demonstrate the presence of a formative effect in depressive and a triggering effect in schizophrenic disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":14,"cited_by_count":263},"references":21,"networkCitations":14,"seed":false}
