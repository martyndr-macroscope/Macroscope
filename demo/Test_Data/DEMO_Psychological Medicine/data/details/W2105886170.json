One month later a second exposure was followed by an akinetic mute state with unusual motor seizures, probably associated with tentorial herniation and brain-stem compression. Elimination of carbon monoxide was unduly prolonged after the second exposure. The patient showed clinical evidence of dementia, but there has been a gradual improvement in cognitive and social functioning over two years.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":14},"references":14,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
