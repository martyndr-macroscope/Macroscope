In fact, their performance was very similar to that of children. However, their performance at judging postural vertical without the use of visual field cues was normal. The impaired performance of the depressed patients was compared with the deficits observed on the same experimental tasks for various other groups of patients with psychiatric or neurological disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
