We replicated this finding and examined the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the TTR measure in the diagnosis and in the assessment of thought disorder. The current clinical value of the TTR is limited, but further investigations of the nature of repetition in schizophrenic language are warranted.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":22},"references":14,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
