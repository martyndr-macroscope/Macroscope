Deficits are more likely to become manifest in problem items with higher demands on planning ahead, which may at least partly explain the heterogeneity of previous findings. As only a small fraction of studies reported coherent information on sample characteristics, future meta-analyses would benefit from more systematic reports on those variables.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":0,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
