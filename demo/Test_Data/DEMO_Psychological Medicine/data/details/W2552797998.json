To investigate this issue, studies controlling for design and stimuli across multiple anxiety-related disorders are needed. Method The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated neural correlates of visual disorder-related threat processing across unmedicated patients suffering from panic disorder ( n = 20), social anxiety disorder ( n = 20), dental phobia ( n = 16) and post-traumatic stress disorder ( n = 11) relative to healthy controls (HC; n = 67). Each patient group and the corresponding HC group saw a tailor-made picture set with 50 disorder-related and 50 neutral scenes. Results Across all patients, increased activation to disorder-related v . neutral scenes was found in subregions of the bilateral amygdala. In addition, activation of the lateral amygdala to disorder-related v . neutral scenes correlated positively with subjective anxiety ratings of scenes across patients. Furthermore, whole-brain analysis revealed increased responses to disorder-related threat across the four disorders in middle, medial and superior frontal regions, (para-)limbic regions, such as the insula and thalamus, as well as in the brainstem and occipital lobe. We found no disorder-specific brain responses. Conclusions The results suggest that pathologically heightened lateral amygdala activation is linked to experienced anxiety across anxiety disorders and trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Furthermore, the transdiagnostically shared activation network points to a common neural basis of abnormal responses to disorder-related threat stimuli across the four investigated disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":41},"references":94,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
