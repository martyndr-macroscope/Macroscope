The results showed a high prevalence of depression in both groups of patients, with no preponderance in the hypertensive group. Hypertensive patients with psychiatric histories had a higher prevalence of depression than the comparison patients. This was accounted for by a significant number of depressions occurring in methyl dopa treated patients with psychiatric histories.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":31},"references":15,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
