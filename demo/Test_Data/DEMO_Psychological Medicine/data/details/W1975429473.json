Type 3 resembled the endogenous depressions and Type 2 the neurotic depressions. Type 3 patients responded well to both imipramine and chlorpromazine and did poorly on a placebo. Type 2 patients showed the greatest overall improvement at three weeks irrespective of treatment received, including a placebo.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":107},"references":45,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
