They did not differ significantly from control samples of comparable non-sterilized women with respect to mental state (Present State Examination) or subjectively-assessed mental or physical health or abdominal pain. More sterilization subjects than control subjects reported subjectively experienced improvement in sexual satisfaction at the later follow-up. Reports of poor physical health and abdominal pain increased over time within both the sterilization and the control groups. Reports of adverse effects at follow-up were often associated with higher PSE scores initially. Regrets and wish for reversal were rare and were also associated with higher initial PSE scores. Since the adverse effects were more common among postpartum subjects, it is suggested that subjectively experienced sequelae of sterilization may sometimes be attributable to ‘normal’ postnatal events.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":19},"references":31,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
