We investigated whether a history of birth asphyxia (ASP) moderates the relationship between intracranial volume (ICV) and intelligence in SZ, bipolar disorder (BD) and healthy controls (HC). Methods Two hundred seventy-nine adult patients (18–42 years) on the SZ and BD spectrums and 216 HC were evaluated for ASP based on information from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate ICV and intelligence quotient (IQ) assessment using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). Multiple linear regressions were used for analyses. Results We found a significant three-way interaction (ICV × ASP × diagnosis) on the outcome variable, IQ, indicating that the correlation between ICV and IQ was stronger in patients with SZ who experienced ASP compared to SZ patients without ASP. This moderation by ASP was not found in BD or HC groups. In patients with SZ, the interaction between ICV and a history of the ASP was specifically related to the verbal subcomponent of IQ as measured by WASI. Conclusions The significant positive association between ICV and IQ in patients with SZ who had experienced ASP might indicate abnormal neurodevelopment. Our findings give support for ICV together with verbal intellectual abilities as clinically relevant markers that can be added to prediction tools to enhance evaluations of SZ risk.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":6},"references":69,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
