In 40% of cases, clinical indications only became decisive in relation to emergent difficulties in managing the case, while 38% of patients or their relatives requested referral. The implications of these observations are considered in relation to alternative models of psychiatric intervention in the management of psychosocial disorders in primary care.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":24},"references":30,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
