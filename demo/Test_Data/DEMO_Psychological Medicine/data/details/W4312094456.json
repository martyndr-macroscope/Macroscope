However, the differential impacts of diagnostic type and degree of parental burden (e.g. one v. both parents affected) on these functional outcomes are unknown. Methods Using the Swedish national patient (NPR) and multi-generation (MGR) registers, 2 226 451 children (1 290 157 parental pairs), born 1 January 1973–31 December 1997, were followed through 31 December 2013. Diagnostic status of all cohort members was defined for eleven psychiatric disorders, and families classed by exposure: (1) parents affected with any disorder, (2) parents affected with a disorder group (e.g. neuropsychiatric disorders), and (3) parents affected with a specific disorder (e.g. ADHD). Pairs were further defined as ‘unaffected,’ ‘single-affected,’, or ‘dual-affected.’ Among offspring, the study evaluated fulfillment of four academic milestones, from compulsory (primary) school through University (college). Sensitivity analyses considered the impact of child's own mental health, as well as parental education, on main effects. Results Marked reductions in the odds of achievement were observed, emerging at the earliest levels of schooling for both single-affected [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.50; 95% CI 0.49–0.51] and dual-affected (aOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.28–0.30) pairs and persisting thereafter [aOR range (single), 0.52–0.65; aOR range (dual), 0.30–0.40]. This pattern was repeated for analyses within diagnosis/diagnostic group. Main results were robust to adjustment for offspring mental health and parent education level. Conclusions Parental mental illness is associated with profound reductions in educational attainment in the subsequent generation, with children from dual-affected families at uniquely high risk.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":2},"references":82,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
