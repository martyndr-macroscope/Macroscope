Thirty-one of the patients were reassessed two weeks after a course of ECT. Before ECT, diminished salivation was associated with retardation and gastrointestinal somatic symptoms. Overall, the patients' salivary secretion did not change after ECT. More detailed analysis showed that the salivary secretion of the more retarded patients was low before ECT and increased subsequently, whereas that of the least retarded patients was high before ECT and diminished subsequently. It is suggested that the relationship between retardation and salivation may explain some of the divergent results of previous studies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":28},"references":23,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
