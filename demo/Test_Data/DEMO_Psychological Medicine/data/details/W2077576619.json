We report that disturbed voluntary motor activity occurs frequently among schizophrenics, is especially associated with features of formal thought disorder, but also with affective blunting, neurologic ‘soft’ signs. Certain motor and thinking abnormalities in schizophrenics may have a common pathogenetic basis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":167},"references":41,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
