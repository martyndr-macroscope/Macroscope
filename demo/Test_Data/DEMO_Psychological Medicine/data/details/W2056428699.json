Amongst non-institutionalized patients responders, who are more highly aroused psychophysiologically than non-responders, were more manic, anxious, assaultive and attention-demanding. Amongst institutionalized patients skin conductance levels and spontaneous fluctuations were associated with behaviour of a schizophrenic character.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":58},"references":19,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
