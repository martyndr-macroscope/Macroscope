These changes were related to original severity of illness and to the extent of improvement, as well as to a number of other clinical features including age at first attack. The reported findings lent support to theories linking depressive illness with reduction in cortical arousability.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":37},"references":17,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
