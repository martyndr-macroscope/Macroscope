However, it is not clear whether deficit and non-deficit schizophrenia are associated with differential neurocognitive profiles. Methods The aim of this meta-analytic review was to compare cognitive performances of deficit and non-deficit patients with each other and with healthy controls. In the current meta-analysis, differences in cognitive abilities between 897 deficit and 1636 non-deficit patients with schizophrenia were examined. Cognitive performances of 899 healthy controls were also compared with 350 patients with deficit and 592 non-deficit schizophrenia. Results Both deficit ( d = 1.04–1.53) and non-deficit ( d = 0.68–1.19) schizophrenia were associated with significant deficits in all cognitive domains. Deficit patients underperformed non-deficit patients in all cognitive domains ( d = 0.24–0.84) and individual tasks ( d = 0.39–0.93). The relationship between deficit syndrome and impairment in olfaction, social cognition, verbal fluency, and speed-based cognitive tasks were relatively stronger. Conclusions Our findings suggest that there is consistent evidence for a significant relationship between deficit syndrome and more severe cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":110},"references":68,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
