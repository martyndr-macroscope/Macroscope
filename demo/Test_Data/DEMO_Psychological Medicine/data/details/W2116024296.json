In the present study ‘duration of treatment’ was regarded as analogous to ‘survival time’, and techniques of survival analysis were applied to data from a previously published study of psychotropic drug use in general practice (Williams et al. 1982). Methods of logistic modelling were used in an attempt to construct a comprehensive and parsimonious model to describe and predict the duration of psychotropic use. Such a model was found to include the effects of previous psychotropic treatment, social problems, duration of treatment and general practitioner behaviour. The implications of the findings, vis à vis the prevention of unnecessary long-term psychotropic drug use, are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":35},"references":31,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
