Moreover, the criteria include somatic symptoms that are difficult to apply in patients with medical illnesses. In a previous report, we developed a briefer definition of MDD that was composed of the mood and cognitive symptoms of the DSM-IV criteria, and found high levels of agreement between the simplified and full DSM-IV definitions. The goal of the present study was to replicate these findings in another large sample of psychiatric out-patients and to extend the findings to other patient samples. Method We interviewed 1100 psychiatric out-patients and 210 pathological gamblers presenting for treatment and 1200 candidates for bariatric surgery. All patients were interviewed by a diagnostic rater who administered a semi-structured interview. We inquired about all symptoms of depression for all patients. Results In all three samples high levels of agreement were found between the DSM-IV and the simpler definition of MDD. Summing across all 2510 patients, the level of agreement between the two definitions was 95.5% and the κ coefficient was 0.87. Conclusions After eliminating the four somatic criteria from the DSM-IV definition of MDD, a high level of concordance was found between this simpler definition and the original DSM-IV classification. This new definition offers two advantages over the current DSM-IV definition – it is briefer and it is easier to apply with medically ill patients because it is free of somatic symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":38},"references":34,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
