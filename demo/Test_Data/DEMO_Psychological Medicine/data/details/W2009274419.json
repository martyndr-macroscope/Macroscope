The study was designed to evaluate a neglected interpretation of Goldstein's ideas that schizophrenics are more concrete, in that their ‘action is determined by momentary sense impressions’. The results gave no support for this interpretation and it is suggested that an abnormal way of categorizing the world is more likely to be a useful way of formulating Goldstein's ideas.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":30,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
