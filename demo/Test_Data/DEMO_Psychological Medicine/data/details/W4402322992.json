This fMRI study examines the reward valuation process under conditions of uncertainty and investigates the associated neural mechanisms in individuals who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) as a coping mechanism for psychological pain. Methods The study involved 44 unmedicated individuals who reported five or more NSSI episodes in the past year, along with 42 age-, sex-, handedness-, IQ-, and socioeconomic status-matched controls. During the fMRI scans, all participants were presented with decision-making scenarios involving uncertainty, both in terms of risk (known probabilities) and ambiguity (unknown probabilities). Results In the NSSI group, aversive attitudes toward ambiguity were correlated with increased emotion reactivity and greater method versatility. Whole-brain analysis revealed notable group-by-condition interactions in the right middle cingulate cortex and left hippocampus. Specifically, the NSSI group showed decreased neural activation under ambiguity v. risk compared to the control group. Moreover, reduced hippocampal activation under ambiguity in the NSSI group was associated with increased emotion regulation problems. Conclusions This study presents the first evidence of reduced brain activity in specific regions during value-based decision-making under conditions of ambiguity in individuals with NSSI. These findings have important clinical implications, particularly concerning emotion dysregulation in this population. This study indicates the need for interventions that support and guide individuals with NSSI to promote adaptive decision-making in the face of ambiguous uncertainty.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":82,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
