AD cases have been recruited since 1986 by the IMAGE Project. Cases and controls were grouped according to the month of birth and according to the day of birth using density estimation. Analyses showed a significant deficit of births in the month of May. We believe these preliminary results deserve further attention and we suggest two possible explanations that could lead to a deficit of AD births at specific periods during the year.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":27},"references":31,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
