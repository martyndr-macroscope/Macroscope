One scale rates according to levels of continence, ambulance, and the presence of specified disruptive behaviours, while the other reflects speech, self-help, and literacy abilities. This information has been found useful in the planning and implementation of services for the mentally handicapped.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":210},"references":2,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
