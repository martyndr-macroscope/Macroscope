The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that both motivation and cognitive deficits affect insight, with a trade-off between the two processes, giving rise to quadratic relationships between insight and cognitive deficits. Twenty-six schizophrenic patients completed battery of neuropsychological tests and participated in an interview designed to assess insight. In a multiple regression analysis predicting test results from insight scores, the linear component was non-significant while the quadratic component accounted for a highly significant 56% of the variance. Theoretical and clinical implications of this result are discussed briefly.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":92},"references":29,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
