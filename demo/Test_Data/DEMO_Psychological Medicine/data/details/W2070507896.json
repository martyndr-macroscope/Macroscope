The evidence regarding the independent influence of duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) on rate and time to remission is far from unequivocal. The goal of the current study was to examine the role of predictors for rate and time to remission in first-episode psychosis (FEP). Method. The differential effect of age, gender, age of onset, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), duration of untreated illness (DUI), pre-morbid adjustment, co-morbid diagnosis of substance abuse and adherence to medication on the rate of and time to remission were estimated using a logistic and Poisson regression, and survival analysis respectively, in FEP patients. Results. In a sample of 107 FEP patients 82·2% achieved remission over a period of 2 years after a mean of 10·3 weeks (range 1–72). Regression analysis, based on complete data on all variables of interest ( n =80), showed status of remission to be positively influenced by better pre-morbid adjustment (RR 0·57, 95% CI 0·34–0·95, p &lt;0·05), later age of onset (RR 1·09, 95% CI 1·05–1·13, p &lt;0·0001), higher level of adherence to medication (RR 1·96, 95% CI 1·38–2·76, p &lt;0·001) and shorter DUI (RR 0·99, 95% CI 0·997–0·999, p &lt;0·005). Time to remission was influenced by age of onset (HR 1·04, 95% CI 1·00–1·08, p &lt;0·04) and adherence to medication (HR 1·58, 95% CI 1·11–2·23, p &lt;0·01). Conclusions. Improving adherence to medication early in the course of treatment may be an important intervention to improve short-term outcome.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":221},"references":0,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
