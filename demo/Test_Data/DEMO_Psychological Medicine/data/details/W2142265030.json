The CH-X is based on assessments of (i) distress and (ii) disability. Our results suggest that with respect to quality of life in mental health settings measurements of distress may be of greater importance than disability. In addition, the CH-X may be insensitive to variations in the severity of mental disorder and may primarily reflect physical disability as opposed to social disability. QALYs methodology may require the adoption of a multidimensional measure of health in order to fulfil its proposed role in comparing medical and mental health programmes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":22},"references":14,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
