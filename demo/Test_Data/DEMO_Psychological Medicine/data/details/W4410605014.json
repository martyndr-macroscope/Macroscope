Both beneficial (e.g. antidepressant and pro-cognitive) and adverse (e.g. depressogenic and cognitive-impairing) mental health outcomes have been described in clinical studies. The underlying neuropsychological mechanisms, whether positive or negative, are, however, not established. Clarifying such activities has implications for the safe prescribing and repurposing potential of these drugs, especially in people with depression. Methods In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled experimental medicine study, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on emotional processing, reward learning, working memory, and waking salivary cortisol (WSC) in 101 people at-risk for depression due to reported high loneliness scores (mean 7.3 ± 1.2 on the UCLA scale). This trial was largely conducted during periods of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic (July 2021–February 2023), and we employed a fully remote design within a UK-wide sample. Results High retention rates, minimal outlier data, and typical main effects of task condition (e.g. emotion) were seen in all cognitive tasks, indicating this approach was comparable to in-person testing. After 28 days, we found no statistically significant differences (F’s &lt; 3.0, p’s &gt; 0.20) for any of the measures of emotional processing, reward learning, working memory, and WSC. Conclusions Study results do not substantiate concerns regarding adverse neuropsychiatric events due to statins and support the safety of their prescribing in at-risk populations. Although other unmeasured cognitive processes may be involved, our null findings are also in line with more recent clinical evidence suggesting statins do not show antidepressant or pro-cognitive efficacy.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":78,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
