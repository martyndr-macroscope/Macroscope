To improve insights into these commonly co-occurring problems, we assessed the bidirectional association of sleep and 24-h activity rhythms with depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly persons. Methods In 1734 participants (mean age: 62.3 ± 9.3 years, 55% women) from the prospective Rotterdam Study, 24-h activity rhythms and sleep were estimated with actigraphy (mean duration: 146 ± 19.6 h), sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Repeated measures were available for 947 participants (54%) over a median follow-up of 6 years (interquartile range = 5.6–6.3). Linear-mixed models were used to assess temporal associations of 24-h activity rhythms and sleep with depressive symptoms in both directions. Results High 24-h activity rhythm fragmentation (IV) ( B = 1.002, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.641–1.363), long time in bed (TIB) ( B = 0.111, 95% CI = 0.053–0.169), low sleep efficiency (SE) ( B = −0.015, 95% CI = −0.020 to −0.009), long sleep onset latency (SOL) ( B = 0.009, 95% CI = 0.006–0.012), and low self-rated sleep quality ( B = 0.112, 95% CI = 0.0992–0.124) at baseline were associated with increasing depressive symptoms over time. Conversely, more depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with an increasing 24-h activity rhythm fragmentation ( B = 0.002, 95% CI = 0.001–0.003) and TIB ( B = 0.009, 95% CI = 0.004–0.015), and a decreasing SE ( B = −0.140, 95% CI = −0.196 to −0.084), SOL ( B = 0.013, 95% CI = 0.008–0.018), and self-rated sleep quality ( B = 0.193, 95% CI = 0.171–0.215) over time. Conclusion This study demonstrates a bidirectional association of 24-h activity rhythms, actigraphy-estimated sleep, and self-rated sleep quality with depressive symptoms over a time frame of multiple years in middle-aged and elderly persons.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":22},"references":70,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
