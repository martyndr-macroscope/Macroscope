Previous studies found that disaster-related exposures, including discrimination/slurs, were associated with their mental health. Their long-term impact has yet to be investigated. Method A total of 968 plant workers (Daiichi, n = 571; Daini, n = 397) completed self-written questionnaires 2–3 months (time 1) and 14–15 months (time 2) after the disaster (response rate 55.0%). Sociodemographics, disaster-related experiences, and peritraumatic distress were assessed at time 1. At time 1 and time 2, general psychological distress (GPD) and post-traumatic stress response (PTSR) were measured, respectively, using the K6 scale and Impact of Event Scale Revised. We examined multivariate covariates of time 2 GPD and PTSR, adjusting for autocorrelations in the hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Results Higher GPD at time 2 was predicted by higher GPD at time 1 ( β = 0.491, p &lt; 0.001) and discrimination/slurs experiences at time 1 ( β = 0.065, p = 0.025, adjusted R 2 = 0.24). Higher PTSR at time 2 was predicted with higher PTSR at time 1 ( β = 0.548, p &lt; 0.001), higher age ( β = 0.085, p = 0.005), and discrimination/slurs experiences at time 1 ( β = 0.079, p = 0.003, adjusted R 2 = 0.36). Conclusions Higher GPD at time 2 was predicted by higher GPD and discrimination/slurs experience at time 1. Higher PTSR at time 2 was predicted by higher PTSR, higher age, and discrimination/slurs experience at time 1.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":22},"references":23,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
