Despite the clinical relevance of these disorders and the need for reliable diagnostic criteria, such a comparison has not previously been reported. DSM-III-R and ICD-10 have converged in their classification of personality disorders, but some important differences between the two systems remain. Personality disorder diagnoses from both systems were obtained in 52 out-patients, using the Standardized Assessment of Personality (SAP), a brief, informant-based interview which yields diagnoses in both DSM-III-R and ICD-10. For individual personality disorder diagnoses, agreement between systems was limited. Thirty-four subjects received a personality disorder diagnosis that had an equivalent form in both systems, but only 10 subjects (29%) received the same primary diagnosis in each system. There was a difference in rate of diagnosis, with ICD-10 making significantly more personality disorder diagnoses. The lower diagnostic threshold of the ICD-10 contributed most of this effect. Further modifications in ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Research (DCR) and DSM-IV to the personality disorder category have been considered. The omission in DSM-IV of three categories unique to that system and the raising of the threshold in ICD-10 DCR, do seem to have been helpful in promoting convergence.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":27},"references":17,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
