The Bedford system of classifying and rating the events was modified to accommodate the perspective of an adolescent. Mothers recalled fewer events than their daughters, but the difference was most marked for the ‘severe’ events of girls aged over 17. There was a marked fall-off in the reporting of severe and non-severe events after the 30th week, and a significant difference between the rate of events in the furthest 6 months, compared with the proximal 6 months.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":72},"references":24,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
