Patients were found to respond reliably and consistently to these questions. It is argued that effective service planning must take account of patients' views of their difficulties and, in particular, of their subjective priorities.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":52},"references":16,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
