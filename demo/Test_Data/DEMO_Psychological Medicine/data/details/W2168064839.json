The Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life (SEIQoL) was developed to overcome such limitations. The QoL of 42 healthy attenders at an international immunization clinic was assessed using SEIQoL. Judgement reliability was high ( r = 0·74) and individuals' judgement policies accounted for a large percentage of the variance in overall QoL ( R 2 = 0·75) demonstrating the construct validity of judgement analysis in this context. In a second study of QoL of out-patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ( N = 20) or peptic ulcer disease (PUD) ( N = 20) was assessed using SEIQoL. Judgement reliability was lower ( r = 0·54) although statistically highly significant ( P &lt; 0·01), and the variance in overall QoL judgements explained was high ( R 2 = 0·74). SEIQoL is an acceptable, reliable and valid technique for measuring individual QoL that takes greater account of individual perspectives than traditional measurement approaches.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":321},"references":38,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
