Excretion of both conjugates correlates with changes in mood. Some reasons to suggest that the sulphate might be a more useful measure of brain activity are stated.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":15},"references":25,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
