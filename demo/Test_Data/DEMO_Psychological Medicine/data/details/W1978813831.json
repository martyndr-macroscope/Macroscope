In both cases, levels in mania were elevated and in depression lowered with interval levels which were intermediate and within the normal range. The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":116},"references":16,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
