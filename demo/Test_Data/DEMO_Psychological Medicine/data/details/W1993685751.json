No relationship was found between site of brain pathology and type of psychotic disorder. A majority of patients had a syndrome indistinguishable from schizophrenia without coarse brain involvement and shared similar variables predicting outcome of psychosis, thus raising important issues concerning their nosological status.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":53},"references":36,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
