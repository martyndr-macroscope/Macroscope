New evidence is reviewed which suggests that ‘classic’ schizophrenia is due to a specific deficiency of prostaglandin E 1 while certain toxic and vitamindeficiency psychoses may be due to a broader spectrum of prostaglandin deficiency. There is also good evidence that a particular schizophrenic subgroup, which includes catatonic schizophrenia but may not be confined to it, is associated with an excess of prostaglandins. Part of the explanation may be that prostaglandin E 1 has a ‘bell-shaped’ dose-response curve with high concentrations having effects similar to those of prostaglandin deficiency.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":77},"references":52,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
