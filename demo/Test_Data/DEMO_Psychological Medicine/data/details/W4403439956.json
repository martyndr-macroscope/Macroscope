Lower doses of antipsychotics have been associated with increased level of function but also with increased risk of relapse. This study presents findings from a specialized deprescribing clinic. In addition, we aim to identify clinical predictors for relapse. Methods Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were referred to the clinic, which offers a six-month guided tapering program. Antipsychotic dose was reduced by 10% every four weeks. Patients were monitored closely for symptom progression or decrease in level of function, with defined cut-offs prompting a pause in or cessation of dose reduction. Results After 12 months, the antipsychotic dose was reduced from 404 (±320 mg) to 255 (±236 mg) chlorpromazine equivalent. Of the 88 patients included, 22 (27%) experienced relapse during the six-month tapering period, while 29 (37%) experienced relapse at the 12-month follow-up visit and nine patients were antipsychotic free. Patients who remained stable experienced a slightly increased level of functioning and markedly fewer side effects ( p &lt; 0.001). Following relapse, patients were clinically stabilized and showed an improved attitude toward antipsychotic medication. The predictive models were weak. Conclusions We show that most patients undergoing guided antipsychotic tapering remained stable after one year and improved in level of function, while most patients who relapsed were quickly stabilized. Our inability to create strong predictive models could be due to limitations in the study design, warranting future studies exploring tapering of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":2},"references":42,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
