The excess of Catholic cases affects only the never-married, and derives much more from the rural west of the territory than from the industrial east. It does not appear to be accounted for by geography per se , by the differential use of services, diagnostic bias, social class distribution, or mean age at marriage. There are indications that some conflict around sex and marriage and, more doubtfully, a sense of relative deprivation may be contributing factors.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":81},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
