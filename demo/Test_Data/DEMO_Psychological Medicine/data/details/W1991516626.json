Regular exposure to stress situations appears to reduce the risk of a malignancy; experiencing a single, major life event was found to be potentially much more damaging, particularly if the individual was unable to externalize her emotions and obtain appropriate help and counselling.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":100},"references":18,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
