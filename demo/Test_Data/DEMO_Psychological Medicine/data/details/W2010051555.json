Psychotropic drug use was measured by the percentage of subjects reporting their use during the past week. It was prominently represented by benzodiazepines (90% of psychotropic users), differed strongly between genders (4·6% in men, 10·2% in women) and age groups (higher after 40 years). A lifetime history of major depressive episode (MDE) or of anxiety disorders was associated with a higher proportion of psychotropic drug use. Psychotropic drug use also went with a current well-being questionnaire score. Using a logistic analysis, the following set of variables held for women: well-being score, history of both MDE and anxiety disorder, age, and marital status. Making allowance for the cross-sectional nature of this retrospective survey, these finding confirmed the relatively high level of benzodiazepine drug use in an urban French community sample and emphasized its association with mental health status.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":45},"references":47,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
