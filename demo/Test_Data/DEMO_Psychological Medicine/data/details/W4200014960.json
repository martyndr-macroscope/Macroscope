Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, but its neuropsychiatric implications in adolescents have not been examined. Methods Twelve- to 17-year-old unmedicated females with major depressive or anxiety disorders or with no psychopathology underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment for this pilot study. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan was obtained, segmented using Freesurfer. Serum ferritin concentration (sF) was measured. Correlational analyses examined the association between body iron stores, psychiatric symptom severity, and basal ganglia volumes, accounting for confounding variables. Results Forty females were enrolled, 73% having a major depressive and/or anxiety disorder, 35% with sF &lt; 15 ng/mL, and 50% with sF &lt; 20 ng/mL. Serum ferritin was inversely correlated with both anxiety and depressive symptom severity ( r = −0.34, p &lt; 0.04 and r = −0.30, p &lt; 0.06, respectively). Participants with sF &lt; 15 ng/mL exhibited more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms as did those with sF &lt; 20 ng/mL. Moreover, after adjusting for age and total intracranial volume, sF was inversely associated with left caudate (Spearman's r = −0.46, p &lt; 0.04), left putamen ( r = −0.58, p &lt; 0.005), and right putamen ( r = −0.53, p &lt; 0.01) volume. Conclusions Brain iron may become depleted at a sF concentration higher than the established threshold to diagnose iron deficiency (i.e. 15 ng/mL), potentially disrupting brain maturation and contributing to the emergence of internalizing disorders in adolescents.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":8},"references":114,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
