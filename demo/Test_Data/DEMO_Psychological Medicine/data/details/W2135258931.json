The original data covered a wide range of severity of illness and the distribution of severity scores was not biased from normal. Hamilton's general factor was confirmed but his bipolarity between agitated and retarded depression did not emerge. Sex differences in factor patterns were found and a preliminary experiment showed that factor scores could isolate anxiety features and personality factors.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":71},"references":10,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
