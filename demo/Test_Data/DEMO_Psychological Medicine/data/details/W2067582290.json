Basal levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and the plasma levels following injection of LHRH were elevated in patients compared with controls; Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and testosterone were not different. Elevated levels of LH have been described previously in recovered manic patients and have been suggested to be state-independent features of mania. In order to clarify the status of this finding, the effects of lithium administration upon hormone responses to LHRH in six male volunteers were also investigated, together with the effects upon Thyrotrophin Releasing Hormone (TRH) stimulation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and prolactin release. Lithium increased the basal levels of LH and levels after injection of LHRH without effect upon FSH and testosterone. Lithium also increased basal and TRH stimulated release of TSH and basal prolactin levels. Lithium was without effect upon prolactin responses to TRH. The results are discussed in relation to current information on the mechanism of lithium's action. The implications for neuroendocrine work on recovered patients taking lithium are also explored.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":32,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
