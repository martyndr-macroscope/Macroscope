Prior work by our team identified clinically significant executive function (EF) deficits in 47% of individuals with 3q29del; however, the nuances of EF in this population have not been described. Methods We used the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) to perform the first in-depth assessment of real-world EF in a cohort of 32 individuals with 3q29del (62.5% male, mean age = 14.5 ± 8.3 years). All participants were also evaluated with gold-standard neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a subset of participants ( n = 24). Results We found global deficits in EF; individuals with 3q29del scored higher than the population mean on the BRIEF global executive composite (GEC) and all subscales. In total, 81.3% of study subjects ( n = 26) scored in the clinical range on at least one BRIEF subscale. BRIEF GEC T scores were higher among 3q29del participants with a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and BRIEF GEC T scores were associated with schizophrenia spectrum symptoms as measured by the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes. BRIEF GEC T scores were not associated with cognitive ability. The BRIEF-2 ADHD form accurately (sensitivity = 86.7%) classified individuals with 3q29del based on ADHD diagnosis status. BRIEF GEC T scores were correlated with cerebellar white matter and subregional cerebellar cortex volumes. Conclusions Together, these data expand our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of 3q29del and identify EF as a core feature linked to both psychiatric and neuroanatomical features of the syndrome.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":88,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
