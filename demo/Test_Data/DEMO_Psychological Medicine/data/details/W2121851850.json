This study sought to evaluate the acceptance of two brief psychological interventions for depressed individuals, contacted through a community survey, and to look for predictors of adherence at the patient level. Method. The authors used data from the Outcomes of Depression International Network (ODIN) study, which included a randomized controlled trial in which depressed individuals from five European countries, and nine geographical areas were assigned to one of three groups: individual problem-solving treatment, group psychoeducation, or control group. In this analysis, we included all of the individuals who had been assigned to one of the psychological interventions. Compliance with intervention was defined in two different ways. Multiple logistic regression was used to see which variables might predict an individual's compliance with psychological treatment. Results. Psychological intervention was offered to 236 subjects. Treatment was completed by 128 subjects and not by 108 (compliance definition A). Three variables were found to have an effect on compliance A: the presence of a confidant, the use of antidepressant medication during the previous 6 months, and the previous use of any social or health services. On the other hand, 164 subjects had agreed to at least start the treatment, and 72 had not (compliance definition B). The three factors associated with compliance B were presence of a confidant, previous use of services, and the ‘desire for change’ score. Conclusions. Social support and previous use of services are the main predictors of compliance with a psychological treatment in depressed individuals from the community. Implications for clinical practice and community programs are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":24},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
