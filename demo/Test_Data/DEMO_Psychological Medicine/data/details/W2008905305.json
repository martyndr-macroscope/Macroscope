As PD can affect outcome in mental disorders, it is important to understand its prevalence in order to plan services, understand prognosis more fully and maximize management options. Method Literature searching revealed 3972 potential papers. Twenty papers including 6345 patients were included in the final analysis. There was great variation in prevalence and multilevel modelling was used to identify possible reasons for this heterogeneity. Results The prevalence of PD varied from 4.5% to 100%. Multilevel analysis suggested country of study, study type, the instruments used to diagnose PD and patient care correlated with the prevalence data explaining the study level heterogeneity, with 34.2, 33.4, 17.0 and 4.5% by each variable respectively. Personality studies in Canada and Sweden reported lower PD prevalence, whereas in Spain it was higher than the multinational study. Compared with randomized controlled trials, case-control studies reported lower prevalence [odds ratio (OR)=0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15–0.79] and observational studies higher prevalence (OR 70.5, 95% CI 8.5–583). Primary-care patients were less likely to be diagnosed (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0–0.19) than hospital patients, and out-patients had higher prevalence (OR 12.5, 95% CI 1.77–88.6). Conclusions The reported prevalence of PD in schizophrenia varies significantly. Statistical modelling suggests care, country, study type and diagnostic tools for PD all bias prevalence rates. The number of papers reaching the inclusion criteria, the relative paucity of information and the difficulties in developing an accurate statistical model limited interpretation from the study.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":66},"references":42,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
