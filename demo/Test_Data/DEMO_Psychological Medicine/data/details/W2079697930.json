Particular topics reviewed include the concepts of potency and maximum effect, the balance between wanted and unwanted effects, and the problems of heterogeneity and variability as they apply to patients and their responses to psychotropic drugs. Types of methods for the assessment of drug effects are listed and the growing importance and relevance of pharmacokinetic studies stressed. A more general and intensive use of the pharmacological approach is urged in order to acquire much-needed basic data on psychotropic drug action in man.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":32,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
