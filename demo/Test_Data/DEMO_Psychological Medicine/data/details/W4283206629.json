Here we test whether such reward sensitivity deficits are dependent on the overall value of the decision problem. Methods We used a two-armed bandit task with two different contexts: one ‘rich’, one ‘poor’ where both options were associated with an overall positive, negative expected value, respectively. We tested patients ( N = 30) undergoing a major depressive episode and age, gender and socio-economically matched controls ( N = 26). Learning performance followed by a transfer phase, without feedback, were analyzed to distangle between a decision or a value-update process mechanism. Finally, we used computational model simulation and fitting to link behavioral patterns to learning biases. Results Control subjects showed similar learning performance in the ‘rich’ and the ‘poor’ contexts, while patients displayed reduced learning in the ‘poor’ context. Analysis of the transfer phase showed that the context-dependent impairment in patients generalized, suggesting that the effect of depression has to be traced to the outcome encoding. Computational model-based results showed that patients displayed a higher learning rate for negative compared to positive outcomes (the opposite was true in controls). Conclusions Our results illustrate that reinforcement learning performances in depression depend on the value of the context. We show that depressive patients have a specific trouble in contexts with an overall negative state value, which in our task is consistent with a negativity bias at the learning rates level.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":18},"references":73,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
