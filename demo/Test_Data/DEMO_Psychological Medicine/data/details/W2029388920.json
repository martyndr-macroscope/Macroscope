Method Clinical high-risk (CHR) subjects (age 12–22 years) with attenuated positive symptoms of psychosis (CHR+, n =101) were compared to healthy controls (HC, n =59) on rates of substance use, including cannabis. CHR+ subjects with and without lifetime cannabis use (and abuse) were compared on prodromal symptoms and social/role functioning at baseline. Participants were followed an average of 2.97 years to determine psychosis conversion status and functional outcome. Results At baseline, CHR+ subjects had significantly higher rates of lifetime cannabis use than HC. CHR+ lifetime cannabis users ( n =35) were older ( p =0.015, trend), more likely to be Caucasian ( p =0.002), less socially anhedonic ( p &lt;0.001) and had higher Global Functioning: Social (GF:Social) scores ( p &lt;0.001) than non-users ( n =61). CHR+ cannabis users continued to have higher social functioning than non-users at follow-up ( p &lt;0.001) but showed no differences in role functioning. A small sample of CHR+ cannabis abusers ( n =10) showed similar results in that abusers were older ( p =0.008), less socially anhedonic ( p =0.017, trend) and had higher baseline GF:Social scores ( p =0.006) than non-abusers. Logistic regression analyses revealed that conversion to psychosis in CHR+ subjects ( n =15) was not related to lifetime cannabis use or abuse. Conclusions The current data do not indicate that low to moderate lifetime cannabis use is a major contributor to psychosis or poor social and role functioning in clinical high-risk youth with attenuated positive symptoms of psychosis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":98},"references":59,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
