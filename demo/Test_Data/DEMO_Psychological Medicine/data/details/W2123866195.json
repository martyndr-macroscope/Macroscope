There was considerable variation both between and within individuals, but a number of factors were defined which appeared to be common to all with the complaint. It is difficult to set up strict criteria for the recognition of bulimia, and those that have recently been proposed are criticized in the light of our present findings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":446},"references":19,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
