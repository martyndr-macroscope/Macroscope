The informants of 52 patients were interviewed separately by two raters for an inter-rater reliability study. The overall level of agreement was excellent, kappa = 0·76, with a range between 0·60 and 0·82 for the individual categories of personality disorder. For a temporal reliability study, the relatives of 77 patients were interviewed. The overall level of agreement was good, kappa = 0·65, with a range between 0·54 and 0·79 for individual categories. Characteristics of informants whose reports were rated with greater levels of reliability were female gender and greater length of acquaintance with the patient.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":49},"references":21,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
