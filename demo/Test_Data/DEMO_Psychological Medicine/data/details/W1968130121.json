After recovery there was a small but significant decrease in the concentration of MHPG and there was positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory. There was no correlation between urinary excretion of MHPG and the concentration of MHPG in cerebrospinal fluid. In contrast with the findings in cerebrospinal fluid there was a significant increase in the urinary excretion of MHPG after recovery.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":67},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
