Carse in 1947, when the hospital was administered by Sussex County Council. The first director was Dr. (now Professor) E. Stengel, and he undertook the first systematic follow-up of leucotomized patients. From 1950 to 1955 the director was Dr. Martin Roth; his studies on the psychoses of old age, and especially those delineating depressive psychoses, are now a landmark in clinical research. At about this time, the means by which clinical research in the National Health Service hospitals should be administered was reviewed and a policy evolved whereby departments in which clinical research was prospering and whose further development would make financial demands beyond those available to the regional hospital boards would be considered for support by the Medical Research Council.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":55,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
