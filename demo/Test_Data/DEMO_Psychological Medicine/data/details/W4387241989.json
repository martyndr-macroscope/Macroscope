Maladaptive eating behavior and, specifically, limited intake of calorie-dense foods are resistant to change and contribute to poor long-term outcomes. This study is a preliminary examination of whether change in food choices during inpatient treatment is related to longer-term clinical course. Methods Individuals with AN completed a computerized Food Choice Task at the beginning and end of inpatient treatment to determine changes in high-fat and self-controlled food choices. Linear regression and longitudinal analyses tested whether change in task behavior predicted short-term outcome (body mass index [BMI] at discharge) and longer-term outcome (BMI and eating disorder psychopathology). Results Among 88 patients with AN, BMI improved significantly with hospital treatment ( p &lt; 0.001), but Food Choice Task outcomes did not change significantly. Change in high-fat and self-controlled choices was not associated with BMI at discharge ( r = 0.13, p = 0.22 and r = 0.10, p = 0.39, respectively). An increase in the proportion of high-fat foods selected ( β = 0.91, p = 0.02) and a decrease in the use of self-control ( β = −1.50, p = 0.001) predicted less decline in BMI over 3 years after discharge. Conclusions Short-term treatment is associated with improvement in BMI but with no significant change, on average, in choices made in a task known to predict actual eating. However, the degree to which individuals increased high-fat choices during treatment and decreased the use of self-control over food choice were associated with reduced weight loss over the following 3 years, underscoring the need to focus on changing eating behavior in treatment of AN.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":9},"references":44,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
