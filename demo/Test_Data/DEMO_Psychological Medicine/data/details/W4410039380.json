This study investigates the relationship between subjective and objective cognitive functions and emotional symptoms in MDD and evaluates their contributions to social functioning recovery. Methods The Prospective Cohort Study of Depression in China (PROUD) involved 1,376 MDD patients, who underwent 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy with assessments at baseline, week 8, and week 52. Measures included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR16), Chinese Brief Cognitive Test (C-BCT), Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression-5 (PDQ-D5), and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) was used to analyze temporal relationships. Results Depressive symptoms and cognitive measures demonstrated significant improvement over 8 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001). Baseline subjective cognitive dysfunction predicted depressive symptoms at week 8 (HAMD-17: β = 0.190, 95% CI: 0.108–0.271; QIDS-SR16: β = 0.217, 95% CI: 0.126–0.308). Meanwhile, baseline depressive symptoms (QIDS-SR16) also predicted subsequent subjective cognitive dysfunction (β = 0.090, 95% CI: 0.003-0.177). Recovery of social functioning was driven by improvements in depressive symptoms (β = 0.384, p &lt; 0.0001) and subjective cognition (β = 0.551, p &lt; 0.0001), with subjective cognition contributing more substantially (R 2 = 0.196 vs. 0.075). Conclusions Subjective cognitive dysfunction is more strongly associated with depressive symptoms and plays a significant role in social functioning recovery, highlighting the need for targeted interventions addressing subjective cognitive deficits in MDD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":62,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
