Although certain notable discrepancies were observed at the item level, the two versions were found to be comparable at the scale level. In addition, cogent evidence was provided for the relative robustness of the symptom dimensions as assessed by the two versions of the GHQ.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":197},"references":25,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
