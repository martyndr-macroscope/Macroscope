This study examines the validity and clinical utility of the ICD-11 PGD guideline by testing its performance in a well-characterized clinical sample and contrasting it with a very different criteria set with the same name (PGD PLOS ). Methods We examined data from 261 treatment-seeking participants in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-sponsored multicenter clinical trial to determine the rates of diagnosis using the ICD-11 PGD guideline and compared these with diagnosis using PGD PLOS criteria. Results The ICD-11 PGD guideline identified 95.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 93.3–98.2%] of a treatment-responsive cohort of patients with distressing and impairing grief. PGD PLOS criteria identified only 59.0% (95% CI 53.0–65.0%) and were more likely to omit those who lost someone other than a spouse, were currently married, bereaved by violent means, or not diagnosed with co-occurring depression. Those not diagnosed by PGD PLOS criteria showed the same rate of treatment response as those who were diagnosed. Conclusions The ICD-11 PGD diagnostic guideline showed good performance characteristics in this sample, while PGD PLOS criteria did not. Limitations of the research sample used to derive PGD PLOS criteria may partly explain their poor performance in a more diverse clinical sample. Clinicians and researchers need to be aware of the important difference between these two identically named diagnostic methods.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":69},"references":33,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
