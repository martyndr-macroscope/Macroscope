The memory tests administered were the 30 Figure Test, the 30 Word-Pair Test, the 30 Person-Data Test (these tests are included in the Cronhoim–Molander test battery) and the 30 Face Test. Three scores were obtained: immediate memory score, delayed memory score and forgetting score. There were no statistical significant differences between these scores before lithium therapy or after 4 and 12 months, except for immediate and delayed memory on the Person-Data Test and the 30 Face Test which showed an increased score of memory functions. The results of this study support the view that long-term lithium treatment with serum levels of about 0·6 mmol/1 does not induce memory disturbances.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":29},"references":45,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
