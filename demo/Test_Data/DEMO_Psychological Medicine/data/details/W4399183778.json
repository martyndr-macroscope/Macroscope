This phenotypic heterogeneity might reflect underlying genetic heterogeneity. At the same time, overlapping characteristics between BD and other psychiatric illnesses are observed at clinical and biomarker levels, which implies a shared biological mechanism between them. Incorporating these two issues in a single study design, this study investigated whether phenotypically heterogeneous subtypes of BD have a distinct polygenic basis shared with other psychiatric illnesses. Methods Six lifetime phenotype dimensions of BD identified in our previous study were used as target phenotypes. Associations between these phenotype dimensions and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of major psychiatric illnesses from East Asian (EA) and other available populations were analyzed. Results Each phenotype dimension showed a different association pattern with PRSs of mental illnesses. PRS for EA schizophrenia showed a significant negative association with the cyclicity dimension ( p = 0.044) but a significant positive association with the psychotic/irritable mania dimension ( p = 0.001). PRS of EA major depressive disorder demonstrated a significant negative association with the elation dimension ( p = 0.003) but a significant positive association with the comorbidity dimension ( p = 0.028). Conclusion This study demonstrates that well-defined phenotype dimensions of lifetime-basis in BD have distinct genetic risks shared with other major mental illnesses. This finding supports genetic heterogeneity in BD and suggests a pleiotropy among BD subtypes and other psychiatric disorders beyond BD. Further genomic analyses adopting deep phenotyping across mental illnesses in ancestrally diverse populations are warranted to clarify intra-diagnosis heterogeneity and inter-diagnoses commonality issues in psychiatry.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":0},"references":35,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
