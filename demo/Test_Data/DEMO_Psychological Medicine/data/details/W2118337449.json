Therefore, we examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of GABA in depressed patients ( N = 25) and normal controls ( N = 20). There was no significant difference between the groups. However, among the depressed patients the subgroup of unipolar melancholic patients ( N = 13) had significantly lower CSF levels of GABA than the rest of the depressed patients ( N = 12). There was no significant difference for CSF levels of GABA between depressed patients who were ( N = 14) or were not ( N = 11) cortisol non-suppressors. It was of interest that among the controls there was a significant negative correlation between CSF levels of GABA and CSF levels of norepinephrine.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":65},"references":37,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
