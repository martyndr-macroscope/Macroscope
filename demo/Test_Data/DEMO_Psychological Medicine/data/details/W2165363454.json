The prevalence of psychiatric disorder in the two groups did not differ. The torticollis patients had significantly higher mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, but did not differ from the control group in terms of hopelessness. Self-referent negative cognitions such as self-blame, self-accusation, self-punitive thoughts, and negative body-image emerged as the prominent component of depression in torticollis, which has implications for the management of depression in torticollis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":78},"references":27,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
