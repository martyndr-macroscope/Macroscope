Meta-analyses were based on published studies satisfying the following selection criteria. The schizophrenic diagnosis could apply to either parent: parents with non-schizophrenic psychoses were not included: only normal controls were accepted. In all, 14 studies provided effect sizes or data from which these could be derived. Studies were identified by data searches through MEDLINE, PSYCLIT and through references of papers relating to the subject. Births to individuals with schizophrenia incur an increased risk of pregnancy and birth complications, low birthweight and poor neonatal condition. However, in each case the effect size is small (mean r = 0·155; 95% CI = 0·057). The risk is greater for mothers with schizophrenia and is not confined to mothers with onset pre-delivery or to the births of the children who become schizophrenic themselves.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":144},"references":51,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
