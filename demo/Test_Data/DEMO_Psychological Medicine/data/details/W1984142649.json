The patients' clinical state was monitored by means of the Hamilton rating scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. The task was performed under three conditions: 2 button (Yes/No); 1 button (Yes); 1 button (No). The findings indicated lower motor responsiveness during depression, consistent with Seligman's learned helplessness model. The measure of auditory sensitivity was also lowered during depression, possibly attributable to attentional disturbance. It is suggested that the lowered initiation of voluntary responses may be an important factor in the assessment of cognitive functioning during depression; such deficits may be reduced if the task does not permit the omission of a response.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":33},"references":23,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
