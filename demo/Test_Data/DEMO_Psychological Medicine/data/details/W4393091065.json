To clarify this relationship, a combined epidemiological and genetic approach was chosen to exploit the methodological advantages of both approaches. Methods Data from 2026 males from a nationwide, representative study were used to investigate the non-/linear relationship between pubertal timing defined by the age at voice break and depression, considering a multitude of potential confounders and their interactions with pubertal timing. This analysis was complemented by Mendelian randomization (MR), which is robust to inferential problems inherent to epidemiological studies. We used 71 single nucleotide polymorphisms related to pubertal timing in males as instrumental variable to clarify its causal relationship with depression based on data from 807 553 individuals (246 363 cases and 561 190 controls) by univariable and multivariable MR, including BMI as pleiotropic phenotype. Results Univariable MR indicated a causal effect of pubertal timing on depression risk (inverse-variance weighted: OR 0.93, 95%-CI [0.87–0.99)], p = 0.03). However, this was not confirmed by multivariable MR (inverse-variance weighted: OR 0.95, 95%-CI [0.88–1.02)], p = 0.13), consistent with the epidemiological approach (OR 1.01, 95%-CI [0.81–1.26], p = 0.93). Instead, the multivariable MR study indicated a causal relationship of BMI with depression by two of three methods. Conclusions Pubertal timing is not related to MDD risk in males.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":58,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
