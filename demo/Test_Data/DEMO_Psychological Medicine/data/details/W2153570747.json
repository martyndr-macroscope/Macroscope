The nature of the morbidity was examined by a detailed assessment of mental state and personality, using interview schedules administered by a psychiatrist. Depressive disorders were presented by nearly half of the patients. The overall sex incidence of the disorders was equal, but alcohol abuse was more common in males. A personality disorder was present in 33·9% of all patients seen, although it was rarely diagnosed as the primary problem and was linked to the diagnosis of anxiety states, rather than depressive neurosis. These findings are discussed in relation to other epidemiological studies in primary care.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":68},"references":34,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
