There were no statistically significant differences observed between treatment sub-groups (antidepressants – mean duration 16 weeks; and benzodiazepines – mean duration 7 weeks). On this basis antidepressants and benzodiazepines prescribed in clinical settings are likely to be equally effective in the short-term treatment of people with panic disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":64},"references":46,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
