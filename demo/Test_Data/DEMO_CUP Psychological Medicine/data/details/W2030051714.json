Although a correlation between the central dopaminergic system and intelligence may exist, the results from imaging studies remain inconclusive. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between striatal dopamine D 2 /D 3 receptor availability and verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Method. Striatal D 2 /D 3 receptor availability of 64 healthy subjects was determined with the [ 123 I]iodobenzamide ([ 123 I]IBZM) ligand. Intelligence quotients (IQs) of the subjects were measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – Revised (WAIS-R). Results. In addition to age, left striatal D 2 /D 3 receptor availability correlated positively with VIQ. In females, left striatal D 2 /D 3 receptor availability was the only variable that correlated significantly with the similarities subtest of VIQ. Conclusions. There is a relationship between left striatal D 2 /D 3 receptor availability and verbal intelligence, which varies, predominantly in males.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":22},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
