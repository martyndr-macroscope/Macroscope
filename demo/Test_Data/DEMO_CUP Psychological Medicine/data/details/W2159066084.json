It was found that the rubric of the inventory failed to describe 5% of ‘marked’ events and 21% of ‘moderate’ events. The relative risk of minor psychiatric disorder in response to events was 3·1 for those defined by the Brown technique and 1·4 for those using the inventory. The results suggests that the post hoc designation is superior. This superiority must be weighed against its undoubted costliness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":25},"references":14,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
