An increase in the level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in cannabis has also been seen. It is currently unclear whether this has led to an increase in the incidence of cannabis-induced psychosis. We aimed to investigate (1) the development of incidence of cannabis-induced psychosis over time compared with other substance-induced psychoses and (2) the development of incident cases of cannabis-induced psychosis over time compared with dual diagnosis defined as schizophrenia and a cannabis use disorder. Method Data on psychiatric diagnoses were extracted from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register and summarized per year as both absolute incidence (number of cases) and incidence rates per 100 000 person years. Results The incidence rate of cannabis-induced psychosis increased steadily from 2.8 per 100 000 person years in 2006 to 6.1 per 100 000 person years in 2016. There was a corresponding increase in dual diagnosis with schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder, but a decrease in alcohol-induced psychosis. The data showed no trend in the other substance-induced psychosis investigated in this thesis. Conclusion The increase in cannabis-induced psychosis follows both the increase in the level of THC in cannabis, and the increase in cannabis use. The change in diagnostic practice does not appear to explain the increase in incidence of cannabis-induced psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":55},"references":22,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
