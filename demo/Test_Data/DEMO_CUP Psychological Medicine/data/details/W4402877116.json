The exact prevalence of this disorder is not known as the literature provides very different results, ranging from 2.5% to 74%. The aim of this umbrella review is to provide an estimation of PTSD prevalence and to clarify whether the prevalence depends on the assessment methods applied (structured interview v . self-report questionnaire) and on the nature of the traumatic event (interpersonal v . not-interpersonal). A systematic search of major databases and additional sources (Google Scholar, EBSCO, Web of Science, PubMed, Galileo Discovery) was conducted. Fifty-nine reviews met the criteria of this umbrella review. Overall PTSD prevalence was 23.95% (95% confidence interval 95% CI 20.74–27.15), with no publication bias or significant small-study effects, but a high level of heterogeneity between meta-analyses. Sensitivities analyses revealed that these results do not change after removing meta-analysis also including data from underage participants (23.03%, 95% CI 18.58–27.48), nor after excluding meta-analysis of low quality (24.26%, 95% CI 20.46–28.06). Regarding the impact of diagnostic instruments on PTSD prevalence, the results revealed a lack of significant differences in PTSD prevalence when structured v . self-report instruments were applied ( p = 0.0835). Finally, PTSD prevalence did not differ following event of intentional (25.42%, 95% CI 19.76–31.09) or not intentional (22.48%, 95% CI 17.22–27.73) nature ( p = 0.4598). The present umbrella review establishes a robust foundation for future research and provides valuable insights on PTSD prevalence.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":103,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
