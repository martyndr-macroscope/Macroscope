We aimed to explore the familial co-aggregation of ASD and asthma using different genetically informed designs. Methods We first examined familial co-aggregation of asthma and ASD in individuals born in Sweden from 1992 to 2007 ( n = 1 569 944), including their full- and half-siblings ( n = 1 704 388 and 356 544 pairs) and full cousins ( n = 3 921 890 pairs), identified using Swedish register data. We then applied quantitative genetic modeling to siblings ( n = 620 994 pairs) and twins who participated in the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden ( n = 15 963 pairs) to estimate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the co-aggregation. Finally, we estimated genetic correlations between traits using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC). Results We observed a within-individual association [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28–1.37] and familial co-aggregation between asthma and ASD, and the magnitude of the associations decreased as the degree of relatedness decreased (full-siblings: OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.38–1.50, maternal half-siblings: OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18–1.39, paternal half-siblings: OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96–1.15, full cousins: OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.09), suggesting shared familial liability. Quantitative genetic models estimated statistically significant genetic correlations between ASD traits and asthma. Using the LDSC approach, we did not find statistically significant genetic correlations between asthma and ASD (coefficients between −0.09 and 0.12). Conclusions Using different genetically informed designs, we found some evidence of familial co-aggregation between asthma and ASD, suggesting the weak association between these disorders was influenced by shared genetics.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":9},"references":51,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
