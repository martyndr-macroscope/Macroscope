Among the Jews there were significantly more patients with affective psychoses and fewer with schizophrenia than among the non-Jews. The methodological problems arising in such a study and some possible aetiological factors are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":14},"references":25,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
