Although it negatively influences treatment outcome, this condition is underdiagnosed and undertreated. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the existing evidence regarding both cognitive and pharmacological interventions for ARCI. We systematically reviewed PubMed, Scopus and Science direct databases up to May 2019 and followed the PRISMA guidelines. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Jadad Scale. Twenty-six studies were eligible for inclusion (14 referring to neuropsychological interventions and 12 to pharmacological treatments). Among neuropsychological interventions, computerised treatments, errorless learning and component method showed positive effects on working memory, memory measures and general cognitive function. On the other hand, thiamine, memantine and methylphenidate improved working memory, long-term memory and general cognitive function. Nevertheless, these studies have several limitations, such as small sample size, lack of replication of the results or low specificity of the interventions. Therefore, no gold-standard intervention can yet be recommended for clinical practice, and further research based on promising strategies (e.g. digital interventions, thiamine) is required.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":21},"references":89,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
