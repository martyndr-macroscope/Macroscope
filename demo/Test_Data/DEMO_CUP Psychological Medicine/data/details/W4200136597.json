This was a population-based, case–control, sibling study examining familial clustering of all psychiatric disorders and low IQ, using data from the Israel Draft-Board Registry on all Jewish adolescents assessed between 1998 and 2014. Methods We identified all cases with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N = 2128), severe intellectual disability (ID, N = 9572), attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) ( N = 3272), psychotic ( N = 7902), mood ( N = 9704), anxiety ( N = 10 606), personality ( N = 24 816), or substance/alcohol abuse ( N = 791) disorders, and low IQ (⩾2 SDs below the population mean, N = 31 186). Non-CNS control disorders were adolescents with Type-1 diabetes ( N = 2427), hernia ( N = 29 558) or hematological malignancies ( N = 931). Each case was matched with 10 age-matched controls selected at random from the Draft-Board Registry, with replacement, and for each case and matched controls, we ascertained all full siblings. The main outcome measure was the relative recurrence risk (RRR) of the sibling of a case having the same (within-disorder RRR) or a different (across-disorder RRR) disorder. Results Within-disorder RRRs were increased for all diagnostic categories, ranging from 11.53 [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.23–14.40] for ASD to 2.93 (95% CI: 2.80–3.07) for personality disorders. The median across-disorder RRR between any pair of psychiatric disorders was 2.16 (95% CI: 1.45–2.43); the median RRR between low IQ and any psychiatric disorder was 1.37 (95% CI: 0.93–1.98). There was no consistent increase in across-disorder RRRs between the non-CNS disorders and psychiatric disorders and/or low IQ. Conclusion These large population-based study findings suggest shared etiologies among most psychiatric disorders, and low IQ.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":5},"references":43,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
