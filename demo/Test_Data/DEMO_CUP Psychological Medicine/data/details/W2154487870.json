The foremost requirement was that false positives be kept to a minimum, with selected children being unequivocally disturbed. Children were identified for treatment by the following measures: ( a ) teacher rating on the Rutter B2 Scale, giving a total score and subscores for neurotic and antisocial behaviour; ( b ) peer ratings on a sociometric measure, yielding isolation and rejection scores; and ( c ) self ratings on the Junior Eysenck Personality Inventory, specifically the neuroticism dimension. A weighting system was developed so that children could be selected on the basis of extreme scores on either teacher or self-rating measures alone, or by a combination of less extreme scores on more than one measure. The results are presented and discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":26},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
