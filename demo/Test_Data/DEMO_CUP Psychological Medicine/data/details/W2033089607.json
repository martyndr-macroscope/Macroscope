The presence of a specific lesion is the reason for the onset of schizophrenia later in life. The genotype for schizophrenia often remains unexpressed, or demonstrates variable expressivity, because of the actions of canalization and stochastic events that may allow migrating neuronal cells to reach or approach the target data. Stochastic events also influence whether canalization will be successful, therefore, chance plays a major role under normal conditions in determining whether the schizophrenia genotype will be expressed. Certain environmental factors acting during early development, such as high temperature resulting from maternal illness, may increase the penetrance of the schizophrenia genotype.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":38},"references":41,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
