This meta-analysis examined the prevalence of agranulocytosis and related death in clozapine-treated patients. Methods A literature search in the international (PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE) and Chinese (WanFang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Sinomed) databases was conducted. Prevalence estimates of agranulocytosis and related death in clozapine-treated patients were synthesized with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program using the random-effects model. Results Thirty-six studies with 260 948 clozapine-treated patients published between 1984 and 2018 were included in the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of agranulocytosis and death caused by agranulocytosis were 0.4% (95% CI 0.3–0.6%) and 0.05% (95% CI 0.03–0.09%), respectively. The prevalence of agranulocytosis was moderated by sample size, study quality, year of publication, and that of data collection. Conclusions The prevalence of clozapine-associated agranulocytosis is low. Agranulocytosis-related death appears rare.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":109},"references":59,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
