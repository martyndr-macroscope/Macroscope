The purpose of the awards is to support research directly related to the causes or treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The research awards are intended to attract established scientists from other areas of biology and medicine (e.g. biochemistry, immunology, virology and neurology) into research on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as well as to provide support for innovative research by scientists already in the field whose funding sources are limited. Applicants are invited from all stages of career development. Awards are for one or two years. They may be up to $75000 a year for studies involving human subjects and up to $50000 a year for other studies. Funds may be used for salaries, supplies and equipment, but it is the policy of the Stanley Foundation not to pay indirect costs for administration of the award. In 1997, 48 applications were funded out of a total of 262 received. Deadline for receipt of applications is 2 March 1998. The 4-page application consists of a brief outline of the proposed project, a budget, and a list of current and pending sources of funding. Notification of awards is made in June and funding to award recipients begins in August. The research award applications are reviewed by a professional selection committee.
