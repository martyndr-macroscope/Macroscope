Method Seventy-five participants were enrolled in the study: 25 with anorexia nervosa (AN), 15 with bulimia nervosa (BN) and 35 healthy controls (HC). Insight was assessed with a modified version of the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight for EDs (SAI-ED) and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis was used to clarify the internal structure of the scale. Neuropsychological tests included the Trail Making Test (TMT), the Brixton Test and a Verbal Fluency Task. Results Only a subgroup of AN patients (24%) had severe impairment of insight. Patients with the restricting type of AN (AN-R) had poorer overall insight than patients with the binge-purge type of the disorder (AN-B/P). More of the ED patients displayed a deliberate denial of illness rather than a lack of awareness of the illness. A regression model revealed that only performance in part B of the TMT (TMT-B) was a moderate predictor of insight level. No association was found between insight and other cognitive or clinical variables. Conclusions Impaired insight is a significant feature of some ED patients. Insight in EDs seems to be partially dependent on intact mental flexibility.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":125},"references":81,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
