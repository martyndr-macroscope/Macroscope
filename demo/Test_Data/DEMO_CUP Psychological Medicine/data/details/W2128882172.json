Dream reports were analysed using an objective and reliable method and were correlated with the day-time attitudes of the subjects measured by Semantic Differential techniques. Anxiety levels influenced both dream reporting and dream content. In particular, aggression towards the dreamer was more common in the anxious patients. Significant correlations were found in all groups between dream content and daytime attitudes. The results were consistent with the ‘continuity’ hypothesis of dream function.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":17},"references":45,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
