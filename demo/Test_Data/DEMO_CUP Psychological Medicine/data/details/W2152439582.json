Both forms were administered to 40 subjects who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, third edition, revised (DSM-III-R) criteria for exposure to a significantly traumatic stressor. Inter-observer reliability was demonstrated with a kappa statistic of 0·90. The computer version had a sensitivity of 0·95 and a specificity 0·95. A correlation of 0·95 was found between the two versions and the mean score difference was non-significant. The computer form demonstrated adequate internal reliability and test–retest reliability. Overall results suggest the computer version is a valid and reliable measure of PTSD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":30},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
