Contrary to the usual findings, smoking did not relate to extraversion (E) but related instead to psychoticism (P). It is suggested that this relation is the true one, and previous findings have been due to a contaminated measure of E. Neuroticism (N) was related to the amount smoked, and particularly to a willingness to give reasons for smoking. There was no relation between the Reasons for Smoking Questionnaire, and attempts or success at giving up smoking. Smokers who rolled their own cigarettes were more introverted than others. No measures showed significant relations with the nicotine content of cigarettes","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":44},"references":20,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
