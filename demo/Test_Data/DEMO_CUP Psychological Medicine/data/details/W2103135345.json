Decreased food intake correlated closely with the amount of weight loss at both 4 and 30 months after surgery. Malabsorption correlated with weight loss at 4 months but not 30 months post-operatively. The cause of the decreased food intake is unknown and cannot be completely explained by either depression, nausea, malabsorption, liver disease, an attempt to avert diarrhoea, or decreased appetite.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":53,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
