Antidepressants were administered to 780 patients; most were diagnosed with mood disorders (62% of prescriptions) and anxiety disorders (34%), the rest with other diagnoses. The mean prescribed dose of antidepressants was at the lower end of, or below, the recommended range for out-patients, with the exception of amineptine and mianserin. The administered dose of tricyclic antidepressants was significantly associated with sex and diagnosis: female patients received a daily dose that was significantly lower than that for males, and patients with a diagnosis of mood disorders received significantly more medication than those with other diagnoses.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":28},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
