Methods We followed 1 516 392 individuals from the Swedish population born 1980–2000, from 1 July 2007, until 31 Dec 2017. We examined putative risk predictors with univariable and multivariable Cox Models and the potential causal effects of predictors by propensity score and co-sibling analyses. Result Of the individuals in our cohort, 24.8% (375 404) received a first OP, of whom 3034 (0.90%) developed a subsequent first OUD. The hazard ratio (HR) (± 95% CIs) for OUD after OP equaled 7.10 (6.75–7.46), with a mean time to onset of 3.41 (2.39) years. The strongest putative risk factors for development of OUD after OP were prior psychiatric and substance use disorders, criminal behavior, parental divorce/death, poor school performance, current community deprivation, divorce, and male sex. Few predictors differed across sexes. OP renewal was associated with a HR of 3.66 (3.41–3.93) for OUD. Co-sibling and propensity score analyses suggested that at least a moderate proportion of the risk factor-OUD association was likely causal. A risk score to predict OUD after OP had an AUC of 0.85, where nearly 60% of cases scoring in the top decile. Conclusions In a general population sample, an OP represents a substantial risk factor for subsequent OUD. Many of the risk factors for OUD after OP can be readily assessed at the time of potential OP, permitting clinicians to evaluate the risk of iatrogenic OUD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":14},"references":42,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
