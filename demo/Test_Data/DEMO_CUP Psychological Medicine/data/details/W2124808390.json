However, potential contributions to this risk from socio-economic factors have rarely been addressed. The main aim of this article was to investigate any such effects. Method A national cohort of 1009 157 children born during 1973–1982 was followed prospectively from 1991 to 2002 in Swedish national registers. Multivariate Cox analyses of proportional hazards were used to estimate the relative risk of hospital admission for self-harm. Parental country/region of birth was used as proxy for ethnicity. Results Youth with two parents born outside Sweden (except those from Southern Europe) had higher age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of self-harm than the majority population (HR 1.6–2.3). The HRs decreased for all immigrant groups when socio-economic factors were accounted for but remained significantly higher for immigrants from Finland and Western countries and for youth with one Swedish-born and one foreign-born parent. Conclusions Socio-economic factors explain much of the variation by parental country of birth of hospital admissions for self-harm in youth in Sweden.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":51},"references":38,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
