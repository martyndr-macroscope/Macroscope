We examine its potential genetic heterogeneity as a function of sex, age, clinical features and mode of ascertainment. Methods In the Swedish population born 1932–1995 ( n = 5 829 952), we examined the genetic risk profiles for AUD, major depression (MD), anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, drug use disorder (DUD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and criminal behavior (CB) in 361 124 cases of AUD subdivided by sex, age at onset (AAO), recurrence, mode of ascertainment and medical complications. Family genetic risk scores (FGRS), calculated from 1st to 5th-degree relatives controlling of cohabitation, assesses genetic risk from phenotypes in the family, not from DNA variants. Results FGRS profiles differed modestly across sex with all scores higher in females. Differences were more pronounced for AAO and recurrence with the FGRS for AUD, DUD, ADHD and CB substantially higher in cases with early AAO or high recurrence rates. Genetic profiles differed considerably by mode of ascertainment, with higher FGRS for AUD and most other disorders in patients seen in hospital v. primary care settings. Cases of AUD with medical complications had higher FGRS for AUD. AUD cases comorbid with MD and DUD had higher FGRS risk for AUD, but this genetic may be less specific given increases in FGRS for multiple other disorders. Conclusions From a genetic perspective, AUD differs substantially as a function of AAO, recurrence, mode of ascertainment and patterns of comorbidity, suggesting caution in cross-sample comparisons of AUD cohorts that differ in these features.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":24},"references":26,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
