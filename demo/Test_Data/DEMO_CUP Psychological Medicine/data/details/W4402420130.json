Methods Using eIMPACT trial data, we examined the effect of modernized collaborative care for depression on indicators of CVD risk. A total of 216 primary care patients with depression and elevated CVD risk were randomized to 12 months of the eIMPACT intervention (internet cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT], telephonic CBT, and select antidepressant medications) or usual primary care. CVD-relevant health behaviors (self-reported CVD prevention medication adherence, sedentary behavior, and sleep quality) and traditional CVD risk factors (blood pressure and lipid fractions) were assessed over 12 months. Incident CVD events were tracked over four years using a statewide health information exchange. Results The intervention group exhibited greater improvement in depressive symptoms ( p &lt; 0.01) and sleep quality ( p &lt; 0.01) than the usual care group, but there was no intervention effect on systolic blood pressure ( p = 0.36), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( p = 0.38), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( p = 0.79), triglycerides ( p = 0.76), CVD prevention medication adherence ( p = 0.64), or sedentary behavior ( p = 0.57). There was an intervention effect on diastolic blood pressure that favored the usual care group ( p = 0.02). The likelihood of an incident CVD event did not differ between the intervention (13/107, 12.1%) and usual care (9/109, 8.3%) groups ( p = 0.39). Conclusions Successful depression treatment alone is not sufficient to lower the heightened CVD risk of people with depression. Alternative approaches are needed.
