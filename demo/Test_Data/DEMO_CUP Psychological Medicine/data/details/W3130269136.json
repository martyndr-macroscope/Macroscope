With a prevalence as high as 1% in children, a deeper understanding of the etiology of the disorder and contributions to risk is critical. Here, we cover the current body of knowledge in scientific literature regarding the genetics of TS. We first review the history and diagnostic criteria for TS cases. We then cover the prevalence, and begin to address the etiology of the disorder. We highlight long-standing evidence for a genetic contribution to TS risk from epidemiology studies focused on twins, families, and population-scale data. Finally, we summarize current large-scale genetic studies of TS along specific classes of genetic variation, including common variation, rare copy number variation, and de novo variation that impact protein-coding sequence. Although these variants do not account for the entirety of TS genetic risk, current evidence is clear that each class of variation is a factor in the overall risk architecture across TS cases.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":14},"references":81,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
