The Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) Scale has been completed by 235 patients with various types and stages of cancer. It is easily understood by, and acceptable to, patients. Data relating to reliability and internal consistency indicate that the MAC scale is a valuable research tool for clinical studies of patients' psychological adjustment to cancer.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":662},"references":28,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
