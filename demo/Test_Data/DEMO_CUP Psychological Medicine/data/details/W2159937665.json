Method During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 181 participants, including 62 BD (36 children and 26 adults) and 119 healthy comparison (HC) subjects (57 children and 62 adults), engaged in constrained and unconstrained processing of emotional (angry, fearful, happy) and non-emotional (neutral) faces. During constrained processing, subjects answered questions focusing their attention on the face; this was processed either implicitly (nose width rating) or explicitly (hostility; subjective fear ratings). Unconstrained processing consisted of passive viewing. Results Pediatric BD rated neutral faces as more hostile than did other groups. In BD patients, family-wise error (FWE)-corrected region of interest (ROI) analyses revealed dysfunction in the amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and putamen. Patients with BD showed amygdala hyperactivation during explicit processing (hostility ratings) of fearful faces and passive viewing of angry and neutral faces but IFG hypoactivation during implicit processing of neutral and happy faces. In the ACC and striatum, the direction of dysfunction varied by task demand: BD demonstrated hyperactivation during unconstrained processing of angry or neutral faces but hypoactivation during constrained processing (implicit or explicit) of angry, neutral or happy faces. Conclusions Findings suggest amygdala hyperactivation in BD while processing negatively valenced and neutral faces, regardless of attentional condition, and BD IFG hypoactivation during implicit processing. In the cognitive control circuit involving the ACC and putamen, BD neural dysfunction was sensitive to task demands.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":64},"references":76,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
