During the follow-up period of 12 months, 31 patients had a further episode of parasuicide and 5 patients committed suicide. The outcome (as measured by repeat parasuicide or suicide) was not significantly affected by the country of origin of the psychiatrist, nor his length of training in psychiatry","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
