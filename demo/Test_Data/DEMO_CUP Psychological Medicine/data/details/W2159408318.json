Method We included 99 patients with early onset AD (age ⩽65 years) and 192 patients with late onset AD (age &gt;65 years) who had at least two scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (range 2–14) obtained at least 1 year apart. Linear mixed models were performed to investigate the rate of cognitive decline dependent on age at onset (AAO) and APOE genotype. Results The mean ( s.d .) age for patients with early onset AD was 57.7 (4.5) years, and 74.5 (5.1) years for patients with late onset AD. AAO was not associated with baseline MMSE [β ( s.e .)=0.8 (0.5), p =0.14]. However, patients with early onset showed a faster decline on the MMSE [β ( s.e .)=2.4 (0.1) points/year] than those with late onset [β ( s.e .)=1.7 (0.1) points/year, p =0.00]. After stratification according to APOE genotype, APOE ε4 non-carriers with early onset showed faster cognitive decline than non-carriers with late onset [2.4 (0.3) v . 1.3 (0.3) points/year, p =0.01]. In APOE ε4 carriers, no difference in rate of cognitive decline was found between patients with early and late onset [β ( s.e .)=0.2 (0.2), p =0.47]. Conclusion Patients with early onset AD show more rapid cognitive decline than patients with late onset, suggesting that early onset AD follows a more aggressive course. Furthermore, this effect seems to be most prominent in patients with early onset who do not carry the genetic APOE ε4 risk factor for AD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":105},"references":29,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
