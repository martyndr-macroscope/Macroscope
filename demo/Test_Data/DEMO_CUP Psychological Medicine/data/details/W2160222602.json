It is therefore unclear if striatal hyperdopaminergia is a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia, or a state feature related to the psychosis itself. Relatives of patients with schizophrenia are themselves at increased risk of developing the condition. In this study we examined striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in both members of twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia. Method In vivo striatal dopamine synthesis capacity was examined using fluorine-18- l -dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) scans in seven twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia and in a control sample of 10 healthy control twin pairs. Results Striatal 18F-DOPA uptake was not elevated in the unaffected co-twins of patients with schizophrenia ( p =0.65) or indeed in the twins with schizophrenia ( p =0.89) compared to the control group. Levels of psychotic symptoms were low in the patients with schizophrenia who were in general stable [mean ( s.d .) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total=56.8 (25.5)] whereas the unaffected co-twins were largely asymptomatic. Conclusions Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity is not elevated in symptom-free individuals at genetic risk of schizophrenia, or in well-treated stable patients with chronic schizophrenia. These findings suggest that striatal hyperdopaminergia is not a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":54},"references":45,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
