The type and impact of trauma may differ between sexes. In a large sample of recent-onset patients, we investigated the associations of depressive and negative symptoms with childhood trauma and whether these are sex-specific. Methods A total of 187 first-episode psychosis patients in remission (Handling Antipsychotic Medication: Long-term Evaluation of Targeted Treatment study) and 115 recent-onset SSD patients (Simvastatin study) were included in this cross-sectional study (men: n = 218; women: n = 84). Total trauma score and trauma subtypes were assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form; depressive and negative symptoms were rated using the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale. Sex-specific regression analyses were performed. Results Women reported higher rates of sexual abuse than men (23.5% v. 7.8%). Depressive symptoms were associated with total trauma scores and emotional abuse ratings in men ( β : 0.219–0.295; p ≤ 0.001). In women, depressive symptoms were associated with sexual abuse ratings ( β : 0.271; p = 0.011). Negative symptoms were associated with total trauma score and emotional neglect ratings in men ( β : 0.166–0.232; p ≤ 0.001). Negative symptoms in women were not linked to childhood trauma, potentially due to lack of statistical power. Conclusions Depressive symptom severity was associated with different types of trauma in men and women with recent-onset SSD. Specifically, in women, depressive symptom severity was associated with childhood sexual abuse, which was reported three times as often as in men. Our results emphasize the importance of sex-specific analyses in SSD research.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":56,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
