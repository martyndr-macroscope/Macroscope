Most attended for physical complaints. A comparison with general population rates showed that deviant children were over-represented among surgery attenders, particularly in the more socially advantaged areas. This finding may be explained through (1) an excess of somatic symptoms in deviant children; (2) increased parental concern about the child's health as an extension of concern about his behaviour; (3) family stress. These possibilities are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":19},"references":33,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
