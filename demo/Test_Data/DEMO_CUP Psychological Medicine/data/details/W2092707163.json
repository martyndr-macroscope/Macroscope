The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) serves to illustrate the application of each theory and provides a vehicle for their appraisal. The tendency to think of ‘physical’ and ‘psychological’ as separate entities rather than separate languages has led to attempts to make a categorical distinction between disorders caused by ‘psychological’ factors and those caused by ‘physical’ factors. Some of the theories developed to account for psychophysiologic disorders are unscientific and none can adequately account for all the features of IBS. It is concluded that the concept of psychophysiologic or psychosomatic disorder is outmoded.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":24},"references":66,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
