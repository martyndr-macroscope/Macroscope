To examine sex differences in DSM-IV subclinical and pathological gambling in nationally representative data of the US population. Method. Data come from a large ( n =43093) representative sample of the adult US population. Results. The lifetime prevalence rate of DSM-IV pathological gambling was 0·64% (95% CI 0·50–0·78) for men and 0·23% (95% CI 0·17–0·29) for women, whereas the lifetime prevalence of subclinical pathological gambling was 6·79% (95% CI 6·32–7·26) for men and 3·26% (95% CI 2·93–3·59) for women. For subclinical pathological gambling, men were significantly ( p &lt;0·01) more likely than women to have smoked more than two packs of cigarettes a day, to be classified as heavy drinkers and to have lifetime diagnoses of alcohol and drug use disorders. Women with subclinical and pathological gambling were significantly more likely than men to have lifetime mood and anxiety disorders. With respect to pathological gambling, women had later ages of onset of the disorder, and were significantly more likely than men to report gambling to relieve depressed mood and to prefer casino gambling. Rates of treatment-seeking for DSM-IV pathological gambling were low for both men and women. Conclusions. There are important sex differences in the prevalence, symptom pattern, sociodemographic and clinical correlates and course of DSM-IV subclinical and pathological gambling. Results underscore the need to investigate sex differences in the social determinants, neurobiology and treatment response of DSM-IV subclinical and pathological gambling.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":294},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
