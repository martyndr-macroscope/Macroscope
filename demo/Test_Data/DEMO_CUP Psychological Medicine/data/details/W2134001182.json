The advantages and disadvantages of these are discussed. The most useful tests are the creatinine clearance, which may be predicted from the serum creatinine using a formula or nomogram, and the measurement of urine osmolality, followed if necessary by assessment of the maximum urine concentrating ability after desamino cys -1–8- D arginine vasopressin.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":9},"references":69,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
