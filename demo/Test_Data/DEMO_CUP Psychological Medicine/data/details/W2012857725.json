In a pilot study using social skills training, six out of seven patients showed marked clinical and social improvement. In the controlled trial, there was evidence that both types of treatment improved behaviour, but that social skills training tended to maintain its effect for longer, even though psychotherapy patients had more than twice the number of therapy hours.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":81},"references":25,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
