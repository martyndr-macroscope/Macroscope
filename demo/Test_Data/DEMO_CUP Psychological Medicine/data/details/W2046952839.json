We hypothesized that there would be an excess of events connoting changes in routine and the social environment. Specific scales were developed to measure these aspects of events. Our results supported the initial hypothesis, confirming that it is the social disruptiveness of change rather than the threat implied by life events that is associated with deterioration. The findings are discussed in the light of current models of the dementia process.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":34},"references":75,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
