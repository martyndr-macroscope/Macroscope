The analysis of the data indicates that depressed affect is a cause of the major somatic problems associated with it. It is suspected that depressed affect involves continuing high density neural firing which, over a period of months, causes a reduction of post- synaptic biogenic amine receptor cell sensitivity in the brainstem, with the diencephalon as the major site. This results in a functional impairment responsible for the somatic problems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":25},"references":47,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
