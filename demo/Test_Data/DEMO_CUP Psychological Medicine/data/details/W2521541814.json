The long-term prognosis after self-harm at young age is inadequately known. We aimed to estimate the risk of mental illness and suicide in adult life after self-harm in young adulthood and to identify prognostic factors for adverse outcome. Method We conducted a national population-based matched case-cohort study. Patients aged 18-24 years ( n = 13 731) hospitalized after self-harm between 1990 and 2003 and unexposed individuals of the same age ( n = 137 310 ) were followed until December 2009. Outcomes were suicide, psychiatric hospitalization and psychotropic medication in short-term (1-5 years) and long-term (&gt;5 years) follow-up. Results Self-harm implied an increased relative risk of suicide during follow-up [hazard ratio (HR) 16.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9–20.9). At long-term follow-up, 20.3% had psychiatric hospitalizations and 51.1% psychotropic medications, most commonly antidepressants and anxiolytics. There was a six-fold risk of psychiatric hospitalization (HR 6.3, 95% CI 5.8–6.8) and almost three-fold risk of psychotropic medication (HR 2.8, 95% CI 2.7–3.0) in long-term follow-up. Mental disorder at baseline, especially a psychotic disorder, and a family history of suicide were associated with adverse outcome among self-harm patients. Conclusion We found highly increased risks of future mental illness and suicide among young adults after self-harm. A history of a mental disorder was an important indicator of long-term adverse outcome. Clinicians should consider the substantially increased risk of suicide among self-harm patients with psychotic disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":89},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
