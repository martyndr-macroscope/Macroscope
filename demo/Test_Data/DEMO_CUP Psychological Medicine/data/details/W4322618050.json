However, the definition of early AAO remains unprecise. We thus tested which age cut-off for early AAO best corresponds to distinguishable neurodevelopmental pathways. Methods We analyzed data from the FondaMental Advanced Center of Expertise-Bipolar Disorder cohort, a naturalistic sample of 4421 patients. First, a supervised learning framework was applied in binary classification experiments using neurodevelopmental history to predict early AAO, defined either with Gaussian mixture models (GMM) clustering or with each of the different cut-offs in the range 14 to 25 years. Second, an unsupervised learning approach was used to find clusters based on neurodevelopmental factors and to examine the overlap between such data-driven groups and definitions of early AAO used for supervised learning. Results A young cut-off, i.e. 14 up to 16 years, induced higher separability [mean nested cross-validation test AUROC = 0.7327 (± 0.0169) for ⩽16 years]. Predictive performance deteriorated increasing the cut-off or setting early AAO with GMM. Similarly, defining early AAO below 17 years was associated with a higher degree of overlap with data-driven clusters (Normalized Mutual Information = 0.41 for ⩽17 years) relatively to other definitions. Conclusions Early AAO best captures distinctive neurodevelopmental patterns when defined as ⩽17 years. GMM-based definition of early AAO falls short of mapping to highly distinguishable neurodevelopmental pathways. These results should be used to improve patients' stratification in future studies of BD pathophysiology and biomarkers.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":33,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
