Correlations between subjective and objective heart rate (ECG) were significantly higher in anxious and hypochondriacal patients than in phobic ones. The results suggest that somatic symptoms in hypochondriacal and anxiety neurosis reflect increased awareness of bodily function.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":112},"references":20,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
