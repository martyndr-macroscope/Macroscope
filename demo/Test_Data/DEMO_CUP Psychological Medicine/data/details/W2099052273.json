The internal consistency and construct validity were similar to the original validation study. However, the factor structure was different. Cultural differences between the British and USA patient populations are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":62},"references":25,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
