The current study used counting Stroop functional MRI and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) to investigate if brain activation of inhibitory control and visual processing would differ in youths with ADHD relative to neurotypical youths. Method We assessed 25 youths with ADHD [mean age 10.9 ( s.d . = 2.2) years] and 23 age-, gender- and IQ-matched neurotypical youths [mean age 11.2 ( s.d . = 2.9) years]. The participants were assessed by using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, third edition, and two tests from the CANTAB: rapid visual information processing (RVP) and pattern recognition memory (PRM) outside the scanner. Results Youths with ADHD showed more activation than neurotypical youths in the right inferior frontal gyrus [Brodmann area (BA) 45] and anterior cingulate cortex, which were correlated with poorer performance on the RVP test in the CANTAB. In contrast, youths with ADHD showed less activation than neurotypical youths in the left superior parietal lobule (BA 5/7), which was correlated with the percentage of correct responses on the PRM test in the CANTAB. Conclusions Our findings suggest that youths with ADHD might need more inhibitory control to suppress interference between number and meaning and may involve less visual processing to process the numbers in the counting Stroop task than neurotypical youths.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":44},"references":43,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
