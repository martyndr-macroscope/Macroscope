Data were collected five times at 1-year intervals (T 0 —T 4 ) using a questionnaire that included the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). Of the non-depressed (i.e. having a SDS score of 47 or less) at baseline ( N = 4857), 14% were found depressed at least once during T 1 —T 4 . Younger, never married, female and blue-collar workers were significantly at greater risk for becoming depressed during the follow-up period ( P &lt; 0·05). Of the depressed at baseline ( N = 505), 20% were depressed every time during T 1 —T 4 . Younger workers were significantly at greater risk for persistence of depressive symptoms during the follow-up period ( P &lt; 0·05). The results suggested that age is associated with both occurrence and persistence of depressive symptoms, while gender, marital status and occupation are associated only with the occurrence.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":17},"references":59,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
