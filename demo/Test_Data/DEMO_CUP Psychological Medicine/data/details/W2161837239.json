Patients with a Newcastle score of 4−8 showed the best response to amitriptyline. Patients with low Newcastle scores, representing the non-endogenous or neurotic group, responded poorly. Patients with high scores on the Newcastle scale, representing those with marked endogenous features, also responded poorly.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":52},"references":9,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
