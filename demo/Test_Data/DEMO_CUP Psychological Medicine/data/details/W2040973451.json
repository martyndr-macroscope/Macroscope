A checklist was used to assess the patients' subjective physical and psychological state before and after exposure to a psychological stressor. For both physical and psychological symptoms the CF group had the largest response, the PC group was intermediate, and the MD group had the least response. Explanations may involve physiological arousal and attentional focusing.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":32},"references":35,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
