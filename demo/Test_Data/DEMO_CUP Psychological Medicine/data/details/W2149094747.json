Time information provided by shrinking WSs reduced the average reaction time in all groups and attenuated the crossover effect (COE) of schizophrenics, although even here more schizophrenics than controls had COE-scores ≥ 25 msec. Erratically changing WSs introduced the COE in controls. Within groups the COE was not related to general response speed, age, duration of hospitalization, or medication. Results are interpreted as indicating that schizophrenics eschew controlled anticipatory processes on the basis of WS- and PI-information which are crucial for motor preparation when PIs are too long to allow an automatic perceptual grouping of warning and imperative stimulus. This may also occur in controls when time estimation is impeded by distraction.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
