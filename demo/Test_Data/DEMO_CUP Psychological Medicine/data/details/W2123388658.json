The one-day census is shown accurately to reflect average bed use in any year. The areas and hospitals involved employed different community and social work policies. A difference emerges in the use of long stay beds. A community-based social work service appears to make little impact on the use of short stay beds, and appears less successful than a hospital-related service in preventing hospital chronicity. Community social work services may identify psychogeriatric patients requiring hospital admission.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":4,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
