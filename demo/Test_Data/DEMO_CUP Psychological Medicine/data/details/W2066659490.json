The present paper could not confirm those results, although a trend in agreement with the original findings was found. The scope of the relationship between levels of aircraft noise and types of psychiatric morbidity is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":35},"references":2,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
