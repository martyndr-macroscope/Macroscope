We aimed to estimate the association between baseline network connectivity and treatment response in a large sample and benchmark its prognostic value against baseline symptom severity and variance. Methods N = 40 518 patients receiving treatment for depression in routine care in England from 2015–2020 were analysed. Cross-sectional networks were constructed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for responders and non-responders ( N = 20 259 each). To conduct parametric tests investigating the contribution of PHQ-9 sum score mean and variance to connectivity differences, networks were constructed for 160 independent subsamples of responders and non-responders (80 each, n = 250 per sample). Results The baseline non-responder network was more connected than responders (3.15 v. 2.70, S = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001), but effects were small, requiring n = 750 per group to have 85% power. Parametric analyses revealed baseline network connectivity, PHQ-9 sum score mean, and PHQ-9 sum score variance were correlated ( r = 0.20–0.58, all p &lt; 0.001). Both PHQ-9 sum score mean ( β = −1.79, s.e. = 0.07, p &lt; 0.001), and PHQ-9 sum score variance ( β = −1.67, s.e. = 0.09, p &lt; 0.001) had larger effect sizes for predicting response than connectivity ( β = −1.35, s.e. = 0.12, p &lt; 0.001). The association between connectivity and response disappeared when PHQ-9 sum score variance was accounted for ( β = −0.28, s.e. = 0.19, p = 0.14). We replicated these results in patients completing longer treatment (8–12 weeks, N = 22 952) and using anxiety symptom networks ( N = 70 620). Conclusions The association between baseline network connectivity and treatment response may be largely due to differences in baseline score variance.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":5},"references":58,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
