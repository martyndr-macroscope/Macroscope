In contrast to results obtained in our previous studies with younger, less severely ill, chronic schizophrenic patients, the current study population exhibited significantly increased rankings of third ventricular size and of fronto-tempero-sylvian atrophy, compared to normal control subjects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":19},"references":41,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
