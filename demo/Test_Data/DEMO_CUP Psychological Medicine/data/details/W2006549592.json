The research is aimed at identifying the demographic and social characteristics that enhance the likelihood of minor psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire, and to reveal how these determinants relate to health status. In the second stage of the study, the same characteristics are related to their effect on the decision to consult a general practitioner and, more specifically, on presenting psycho-social problems to the GP. At the population level, the likelihood of a high GHQ score was greater for women, divorced persons and the unemployed, other variables remaining equal. However, GHQ score was contaminated by poor subjective health perception, especially for unemployed persons. Chronic physical illness did not have an independent effect on the GHQ score. Chronic physical illness did influence help-seeking. In addition, several socio-demographic characteristics showed an independent effect on consulting behaviour for both GHQ-positive and GHQ-negative patients. Women, unemployed persons and publicly insured patients with a minor psychiatric disturbance were more apt to visit their GP, regardless of their physical health status. However, no socio-demographic characteristics increased the likelihood that a GHQ-positive patient would present unambiguous psycho-social complaints as a reason to see their doctor.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":61},"references":33,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
