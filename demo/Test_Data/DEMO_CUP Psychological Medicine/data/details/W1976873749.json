Overall, patients who relapsed experienced significantly more life events in the three months before relapse, and especially in the month immediately preceding it. Undesirable events were particularly implicated. Event rates prior to relapse were closely comparable in treatment subgroups, giving no evidence that differential stress was required to produce relapse. The findings reinforce previous studies indicating an overall relationship between life events of certain types and depression, but do not suggest that the beneficial effects of maintenance treatment are specifically protective against life stress.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":180},"references":13,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
