Follow-up interview showed the non-psychotic co-twins to have schizotypal personality disorder. It is concluded that obsessive-compulsive and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders can truly co-exits, thus supporting diagnostic changes introduced into DSM-III-R, and may in some cases be inherited together.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":16},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
