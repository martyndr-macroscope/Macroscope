Methods Multiple Swedish nationwide registers were used to identify 8045 individuals, aged 20–29, with an incident diagnosis of ADHD 2006–2011. Labour market integration was conceptualized according to the core-peripheral model as a continuum from a strong (core) to a weak (peripheral) connection to the labour market. Sequence analyses categorized clusters of labour market integration, from 1 year before to 5 years after their ADHD diagnosis for individuals diagnosed with ADHD and a matched control group without ADHD. Multinomial logistic regression computed odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between sociodemographic factors and comorbid disorders and the identified clusters. Results About one-fourth of the young adults diagnosed with ADHD belonged to clusters characterized by a transition to a mainly peripheral labour market position, which was approximately four-times higher compared to controls without ADHD. Foremost, those living in small cities/villages (OR 1.9; CI 1.5–2.2), those having comorbid autism-spectrum disorder (OR 13.7; CI 6.8–27.5) or schizophrenia/psychoses (OR 7.8; CI 3.8–15.9) were associated with a transition towards a peripheral labour market position throughout the study period. Those with a high educational level (OR 0.1; CI 0.1–0.1), and men (OR 0.7; CI 0.6–0.8) were less likely to have a peripheral labour market position. Conclusions Young adults diagnosed with ADHD are four-times more likely to be in the peripheral labour market position compared to those without ADHD. To increase labour market participation, special attention is warranted to those with low educational level, those living outside big cities and those with comorbid mental disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":37,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
