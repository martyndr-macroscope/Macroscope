No substantial relationships were found between these factors. An earlier onset of illness before 3 years was associated with a higher serum IgE. These results do not support the commonly held concept that asthma is a ‘psychosomatic’ disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":16},"references":20,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
