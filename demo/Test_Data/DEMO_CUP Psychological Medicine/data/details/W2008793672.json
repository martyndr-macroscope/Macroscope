Significant differences in patients' responses were related to their employment status and the degree of severity of haemophilia. Unemployed patients with milder forms of haemophilia appeared to be least adjusted and suffered most from psychosomatic symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":19},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
