The effects of the drugs on the activity of 20 chronic inert male schizophrenic patients were measured using nursing observations, psychiatric rating, and an operant conditioning method. When activity was assessed in these different ways, no significant difference was found between the two drugs on any of the measures. It is concluded that pimozide does not effectively increase the activity in such patients. It is considered that the free operant conditioning method used was shown to be a useful measure for comparing therapy in chronic schizophrenic patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":6},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
