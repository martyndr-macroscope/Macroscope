Research examining SI and Type A behaviour, however, has not rigorously evaluated the structure of the SI scale. The present study examined the structure of a previously used eight-item SI scale, and its relation to a questionnaire measure of Type A (the student Jenkins Activity Survey), for a sample of 504 undergraduates. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of responses to the SI items revealed a three-factor solution was most appropriate for Type As, and a two-factor solution for Type Bs. For both As and Bs, the first factor reflected insecurity regarding one's own capabilities and worth (self-specific insecurity), and the second factor reflected insecurity specific to a group or social context (group-specific insecurity). A third factor emerging only for Type As reflected insecurity regarding others' capabilities (other-directed insecurity). Semipartial correlations revealed Type A total score was marginally negatively related to group-specific insecurity and marginally positively related to other-directed insecurity, corroborating previous angiographic and prospective medical research. The hard-driving/competitive subscale was significantly negatively related to self-specific insecurity, supporting evidence regarding Type A and interpersonal dominance, competitiveness, and aggression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":65,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
