A resolution of these paradoxes is suggested relying on a role for dopamine in learning processes at a relatively high (cognitive) functional level. The hypothesis proposed is also used to explain the origin of some of the more distinctive psychotic symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":43},"references":97,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
