Outcomes examined were length of time to remission, presence of residual symptoms at remission, and subsequent relapse. There were few associations between these outcomes and the social variables. These findings add to other recent evidence that psychosocial factors are relatively unimportant in the subsequent course of severe and recurrent depressions, in contrast to their contribution to onset of such depressions and subsequent outcome of milder depressions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":112},"references":60,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
