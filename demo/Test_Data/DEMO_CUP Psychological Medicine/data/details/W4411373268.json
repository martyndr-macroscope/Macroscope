Collectively, these correlations define the architecture of psychopathology – informing taxonomic and mechanistic models in psychiatry. However, to date, it remains unclear if this architecture differs between etiologically distinct subgroups, despite the core relevance of this understanding for personalized medicine. Here, we introduce a new analytic pipeline to probe group differences in the psychopathology architecture – demonstrated through the comparison of two distinct neurogenetic disorders. Methods We use a large questionnaire battery in 300 individuals aged 5–25 years ( n = 102 XXY/KS, n = 64 XYY, n = 134 age-matched XY) to characterize the structure of correlations among 53 diverse measures of psychopathology in XXY/KS and XYY syndrome – enabling us to compare the effects of X- versus Y-chromosome dosage on the architecture of psychopathology at multiple, distinctly informative levels. Results Behavior correlation matrices describe the architecture of psychopathology in each syndrome. A comparison of matrix rows reveals that social problems and externalizing symptoms are most differentially coupled to other aspects of psychopathology in XXY/KS versus XYY. Clustering the difference between matrices captures coordinated group differences in pairwise coupling between measures of psychopathology: XXY/KS shows greater coherence among externalizing, internalizing, and autism-related features, while XYY syndrome shows greater coherence in dissociality and early neurodevelopmental impairment. Conclusions These methods offer new insights into X- and Y-chromosome dosage effects on behavior, and our shared code can now be applied to other clinical groups of interest – helping to hone mechanistic models and inform the tailoring of care.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":38,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
