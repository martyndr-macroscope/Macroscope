Evidence is presented from a logistic regression analysis of data from a volunteer community sample that lack of care rather than over-protection is the primary risk factor. No evidence for an interaction effect of low care and over-protection was found.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":141},"references":30,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
