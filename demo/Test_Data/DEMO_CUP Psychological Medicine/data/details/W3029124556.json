According to classical clinical characterizations, schizophrenia is included in a continuum encompassing a large range of genetic statuses, psychotic states and symptoms. The current meta-analysis aims to determine whether self-recognition is affected by individuals within the psychosis continuum. Method Three populations were considered: people with an at-risk mental state for psychosis (ARMS), hallucination-prone individuals and unaffected relatives of patients with schizophrenia. Eleven studies contrasted self-recognition between these three populations ( n = 386) and healthy controls ( n = 315) and four studies used correlational analysis to estimate comparable effects ( n = 629). Eligible studies used experimental paradigms including source-monitoring and self-monitoring. Results We observed significantly reduced self-recognition accuracy in these populations [ g = −0.44 (−0.71 to −0.17), p = 0.002] compared to controls. No influence of the type of population, experimental paradigm or study design was observed. Conclusion The present analysis argues for self-recognition deficits in populations with no full-blown psychotic symptoms represented across the continuum of psychosis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":9},"references":70,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
