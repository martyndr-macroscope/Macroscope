They are often multi-users of care. In the present investigation we have studied patients visiting primary health care clinics who have been assessed for mental health problems according to the Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL-25). Two quality-of-life instruments (the Nottingham Health Profile and the Mood Adjective Check List) were applied to describe further the perceived health of the sample. A random sample of 93 patients was chosen out of 388 patients visiting a primary health care clinic in a Swedish health care district during four weeks in January and February 1990, and these patients were followed prospectively during one year. High consumers of health care during the follow-up period scored a poor perceived health. ‘Feeling worthless’, predicted a high number of days of sickness absenteeism. Hidden cases, not detected by the GPs, consumed more resources than those identified by the GPs. The importance of training and educating general practitioners in the early detection of patients with mental health problems is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":27},"references":26,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
