The incidence of depression was highest in the first trimester and, overall, about a fifth of the sample was found to be suffering from clinically significant neurotic disturbances. In a proportion of these expectant mothers there was an association between depression and anxiety early in pregnancy and a previous history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a reactivation of mourning which was previously suppressed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":47},"references":21,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
