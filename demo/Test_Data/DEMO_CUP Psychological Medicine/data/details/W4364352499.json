Generally, in this area of research, the bifactor model is preferred to the second order common factor model. In this commentary, we identify several interpretational issues concerning the bifactor model, which are based on a realistic psychometric view of latent variables. These issues may hamper the study of the nature of p factor model using the bifactor model.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":17,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
