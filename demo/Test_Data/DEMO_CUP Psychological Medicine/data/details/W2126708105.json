In this paper it is argued that such agreement may not be an adequate basis for validation since the accounts may not be independent. Likewise, low across-interview agreement may not signify the inaccuracy of either report because of the phenomenon of ‘object-variation’. It is concluded that, although this method of validation can be significantly improved, it should be supplemented, wherever possible, by other approaches.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":28},"references":51,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
