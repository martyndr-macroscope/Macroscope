This prospective longitudinal study investigated the prognostic validity of acute stress disorder (ASD), of variables derived from a meta-analysis of risk factors for PTSD, and of candidate cognitive and biological variables in predicting chronic PTSD following assault. Method Assault survivors who had been treated for their injuries at a metropolitan Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) Department were assessed with structured clinical interviews to establish diagnoses of ASD at 2 weeks ( n =222) and PTSD at 6 months ( n =205) after the assault. Candidate predictors were assessed at 2 weeks. Results Most predictors significantly predicted PTSD status at follow-up. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that a set of four theory-derived cognitive variables predicted PTSD best (Nagelkerke R 2 =0·50), followed by the variables from the meta-analysis (Nagelkerke R 2 =0·37) and ASD (Nagelkerke R 2 =0·25). When all predictors were considered simultaneously, mental defeat, rumination and prior problems with anxiety or depression were chosen as the best combination of predictors (Nagelkerke R 2 =0·47). Conclusion Questionnaires measuring mental defeat, rumination and pre-trauma psychological problems may help to identify assault survivors at risk of chronic PTSD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":214},"references":54,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
