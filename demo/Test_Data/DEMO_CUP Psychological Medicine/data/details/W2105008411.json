The law should be reformed by changing statutes which force expert witnesses to testify beyond their science, by taking the provision of expert evidence out of the adversarial context, and by removing from the courts the decision whether a nascent discipline is or is not a science.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":23},"references":2,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
