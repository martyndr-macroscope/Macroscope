This procedure covers 21 areas of clinical and social functioning, and in each of these specifies appropriate interventions. Decision rules are described which permit problems in functioning to be primarily classified as a met need, an unmet need, or as involving no need, and which allow the identification of various secondary needs. We report preliminary data on the reliability and validity of this procedure and discuss its potential applications in the care of the long-term mentally ill.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":13,"cited_by_count":275},"references":11,"networkCitations":13,"seed":false}
