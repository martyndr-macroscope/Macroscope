We aimed to examine the associations of this new lung function impairment phenotype with depression and anxiety in longitudinal studies. Methods We included 369 597 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, and divided them into population 1 without depression or anxiety and population 2 with depression or anxiety at baseline. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to evaluate the associations of lung function impairment phenotype with adverse outcomes of depression and anxiety, as well as their subtypes. Results At baseline, 38 879 (10.5%) participants were diagnosed with PRISm. In population 1, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PRISm ( v. normal spirometry) were 1.12 (95% CI 1.07–1.18) for incident depression, and 1.11 (95% CI 1.06–1.15) for incident anxiety, respectively. In population 2, PRISm was a risk factor for mortality in participants with depression (HR: 1.46; 95% CI 1.31–1.62) and anxiety (HR: 1.70; 95% CI 1.44–2.02), compared with normal spirometry. The magnitudes of these associations were similar in the phenotypes of lung function impairment and the subtypes of mental disorders. Trajectory analysis showed that the transition from normal spirometry to PRISm was associated with a higher risk of mortality in participants with depression and anxiety. Conclusions PRISm and airflow obstruction have similar risks of depression and anxiety. PRISm recognition may contribute to the prevention of depression and anxiety.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":42,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
