Methods Using population-based registers, quarterly cohorts from the first quarter of 2018 (2018Q1) to 2021Q4 were formed including all Swedish-residents &gt;10 years old. Interrupted time series and generalized estimating equations analyses were used to evaluate changes in Incidence Rates (IR) of specialised healthcare use for suicide attempt and death by suicide per 10 000 person-years for individuals with or without specific severe mental disorders (SMDs) during, compared to before the pandemic. Results The IR (95% Confidence interval, CI) of suicide in individuals with SMDs decreased from 16.0 (15.0–17.1) in 2018Q1 to 11.6 (10.8–12.5) in 2020Q1 (i.e. the quarter before the start of the pandemic), after which it dropped further to 6.7 (6.3–7.2) in 2021Q2. In contrast, IRs of suicide attempt in SMDs showed more stable trends, as did the trends regarding suicide and suicide attempt for individuals without SMD. These discrepancies were most evident for individuals with substance use disorder and ASD/ADHD. Changes in IRs of suicide v. suicide attempt for one quarter during the pandemic for substance misuse were 11.2% v. 3.6% respectively. These changes for ASD/ADHD were 10.7% v. 3.6%. Conclusions The study shows pronounced decreases in suicide rates in individuals with SMDs during the pandemic. Further studies aiming to understand mechanisms behind these trends are warranted to consult future suicide prevention strategies.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":38,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
