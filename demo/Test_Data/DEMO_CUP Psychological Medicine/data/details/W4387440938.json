Recent basic science models demonstrate that, during fear learning, patterns of activity in large neuronal ensembles for the conditioned stimuli (CS) begin to reinstate neural activity patterns for the unconditioned stimuli (US), suggesting a direct way of quantifying fear memory strength for the CS. Here, we translate this concept to human neuroimaging and test the impact of post-learning dopaminergic neurotransmission on fear memory strength during fear acquisition, extinction, and recall among women with PTSD in a re-analysis of previously reported data. Methods Participants ( N = 79) completed a context-dependent fear acquisition and extinction task on day 1 and extinction recall tests 24 h later. We decoded activity patterns in large-scale functional networks for the US, then applied this decoder to activity patterns toward the CS on day 1 and day 2. Results US decoder output for the CS+ increased during acquisition and decreased during extinction in networks traditionally implicated in human fear learning. The strength of US neural reactivation also predicted individuals skin conductance responses. Participants randomized to receive L-DOPA ( n = 43) following extinction on day 1 demonstrated less US neural reactivation on day 2 relative to the placebo group ( n = 28). Conclusion These results support neural reactivation as a measure of memory strength between competing memories of threat and safety and further demonstrate the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the consolidation of fear extinction memories.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":5},"references":39,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
