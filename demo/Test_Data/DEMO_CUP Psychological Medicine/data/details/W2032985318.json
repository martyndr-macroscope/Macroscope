Negative correlations of high statistical significance were found between locus of control and compliance with the diet, and locus of control and vocational rehabilitation, as well as between locus of control and acceptance of disability. All the findings indicate that patients with internal locus of control adjust and adapt better than those with external locus of control. The number of years on dialysis did not correlate with locus of control. It might be suggested that the shift from internal to external locus of control occurs prior to dialysis in the stage of chronic kidney disease.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":87},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
