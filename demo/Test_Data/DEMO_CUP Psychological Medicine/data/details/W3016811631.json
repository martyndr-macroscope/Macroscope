We here seek to conduct such a study using an adoptive co-sib control design. Methods Defining high-risk as having ⩾1 biological parent with an externalizing syndrome (AUD, drug abuse or crime), we identified 1316 high-risk full-sibships and 4623 high-risk half-sibships containing at least one member who was home-reared and one who was adopted-away. Adoptive families are carefully screened in Sweden to provide high-quality rearing environment for adoptees. AUD was assessed from national medical, criminal and pharmacy registries. Results Controlling for sex, parental age at birth, and, for half-siblings, affection status of the non-shared parent, hazard ratios (±95% CI) for AUD in the matched adopted v. home-reared full- and half-siblings were, respectively, 0.76 (0.65–0.89) and 0.77 (0.70–0.84). The protective effect of adoption on AUD risk was stronger in the full- and half-sibling pairs with very high familial liability (two high-risk parents) and significantly weaker when the adoptive family was broken by death or divorce or contained a high-risk adoptive parent. Conclusions In both full- and half-sibling pairs, we found evidence that the rearing environment substantially impacts on the risk for AUD. High-quality rearing environments can meaningfully reduce the risk for AUD, especially in those at high familial risk.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":4},"references":25,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
