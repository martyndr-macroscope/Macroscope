The aim of this study was to investigate the association of cognitive/affective and somatic/affective symptoms of depression with cardiovascular prognosis in patients with heart disease using a meta-analytic perspective. Method A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and PsycInfo. Thirteen prospective studies on symptom dimensions of depression and cardiovascular prognosis fulfilled the inclusion criteria, providing data on a total of 11 128 subjects. The risk estimates for each dimension of depressive symptoms, demographic and methodological variables were extracted from the included articles. Results In least-adjusted analyses, both the somatic/affective [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19–1.41, p &lt; 0.001] and cognitive/affective (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00–1.15, p = 0.05) dimensions of depressive symptoms were associated with cardiovascular prognosis. In fully adjusted analyses, somatic/affective symptoms were significantly associated with adverse prognosis (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10–1.29, p &lt; 0.001) but cognitive/affective symptoms were not (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97–1.12, p = 0.25). An increase of one standard deviation (±1 s .d. ) in the scores of the somatic/affective dimension was associated with a 32% increased risk of adverse outcomes (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17–1.48, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Somatic/affective depressive symptoms were more strongly and consistently associated with mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with heart disease compared with cognitive/affective symptoms. Future research should focus on the mechanisms by which somatic/affective depressive symptoms may affect cardiovascular prognosis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":129},"references":51,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
