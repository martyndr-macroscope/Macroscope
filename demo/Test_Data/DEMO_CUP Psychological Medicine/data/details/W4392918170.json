Elucidating the neural mechanisms of AN is necessary to identify novel treatment targets and improve outcomes. A growing body of literature points to a role for dorsal fronto-striatal circuitry in the pathophysiology of AN, with increasing evidence of abnormal task-based fMRI activation within this network among patients with AN. Whether these abnormalities are present at rest and reflect fundamental differences in brain organization is unclear. Methods The current study combined resting-state fMRI data from patients with AN ( n = 89) and healthy controls (HC; n = 92) across four studies, removing site effects using ComBat harmonization. First, the a priori hypothesis that dorsal fronto-striatal connectivity strength – specifically between the anterior caudate and dlPFC – differed between patients and HC was tested using seed-based functional connectivity analysis with small-volume correction. To assess specificity of effects, exploratory analyses examined anterior caudate whole-brain connectivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and node centrality. Results Compared to HC, patients showed significantly reduced right, but not left, anterior caudate-dlPFC connectivity ( p = 0.002) in small-volume corrected analyses. Whole-brain analyses also identified reduced connectivity between the right anterior caudate and left superior frontal and middle frontal gyri ( p = 0.028) and increased connectivity between the right anterior caudate and right occipital cortex ( p = 0.038). No group differences were found in analyses of anterior caudate ALFF and node centrality. Conclusions Decreased coupling of dorsal fronto-striatal regions indicates that circuit-based abnormalities persist at rest and suggests this network may be a potential treatment target.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":74,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
