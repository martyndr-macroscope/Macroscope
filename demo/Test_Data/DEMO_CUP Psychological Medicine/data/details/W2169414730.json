The validity of the construct of subjective response is evaluated by comparison of two measures. Fifty-five recently admitted and unmedicated schizophrenic patients were randomly allocated to chlorpromazine or haloperidol. Subjective responses at 24 and 48 hours as assessed by two different scales, the Van Putten &amp; May scale and the self-administered Drug Attitude Inventory, were strongly correlated with outcome at three weeks. Early emergence of extrapyramidal symptoms was not related to subjective response, but dysphoric patients had a greater incidence of EPS by the end of treatment than did non-dysphoric patients. The two measures showed high concordance in identification of early drug dysphoria.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":164},"references":24,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
