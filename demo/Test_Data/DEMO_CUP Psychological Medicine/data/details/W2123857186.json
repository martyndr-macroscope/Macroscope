Initially the concept reflected the Romantic psychiatrists' emphasis on the whole personality. With the advent of materialism the concept was applied to all mental disorders. Because of the claims for organic cerebral findings in dementia praecox, it was described by Meyer as fitting the disease concept, with characteristic pathology, symptomatology, course and prognosis. However, the different social milieux of patients being treated by psychiatrists such as Kraepelin and Bonhoeffer led to different emphases regarding the aetiology of the psychoses. In the later twentieth century the influence of urbanization in Europe and Africa and also the rise of Nazism led to changes in relation to the use of the concept of psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":10},"references":29,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
