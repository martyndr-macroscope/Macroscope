Pathological alterations of the dentate gyrus, including cytoarchitectural changes, immaturity and axonal reorganization that occur in epilepsy, may also underpin co-morbid psychiatric disorders. Our aim was to study candidate pathways that may be associated with the development of interictal psychosis post-operatively in patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Method A total of 11 patients with HS who developed interictal psychosis (HS-P) post-operatively were compared with a matched surgical HS group without psychosis (HS-NP). Resected tissues were investigated for the extent of granule cell dispersion, mossy fibre sprouting and calbindin expression in the granule cells. We quantified doublecortin, mini-chromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2) and reelin-expressing neuronal populations in the dentate gyrus as well as the distribution of cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CBR1). Results The patterns of neuronal loss and gliosis were similar in both groups. HS-P patients demonstrated less mossy fibre sprouting and granule cell dispersion ( p &lt; 0.01) and more frequent reduction in calbindin expression in granule cells. There were no group differences in the densities of immature MCM2, doublecortin and reelin-positive cells. CBR1 labelling was significantly lower in Cornu ammonis area CA4 relative to other subfields ( p &lt; 0.01); although reduced staining in all hippocampal regions was noted in HS-P compared with HS-NP patients, the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions The alterations in dentate gyrus pathology found in HS-P patients could indicate underlying differences in the cellular response to seizures. These mechanisms may predispose to the development of psychosis in epilepsy and warrant further investigation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":96,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
