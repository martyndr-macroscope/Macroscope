The findings showed that the patients perceived hunger in a manner similar to the controls, but they were more preoccupied with thoughts of food, had a stronger urge to eat, and were more anxious when hungry. The patients, unlike the controls, frequently did not describe satiety in terms of gastric fullness. The disordered perception of satiety, however, was not related to clinical outcome. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for treating anorexia nervosa.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":99},"references":26,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
