Two cases are reported, one of type 1, the other of type 2, and 17 other cases of lithium-induced hypothyroidism in the literature are reviewed. The literature on the occurrence of goitre during lithium treatment, and that on the alteration of thyroid function tests are also reviewed. Possible mechanisms for the disturbance of thyroid function are discussed and recommendations for managing this complication of lithium therapy are made.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":39},"references":23,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
