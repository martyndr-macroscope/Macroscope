Although the major contributions of both men show a remarkable but independent coincidence around 1873, Gull is mostly given a slight priority because of a rather cryptic mention of an anorexia-like condition in a paper read in 1868. An analysis of the events, however, shows that the British physician from London does not really deserve this honour. For no clear-cut priority for either man can be established.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":36},"references":23,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
