This study was designed to investigate the cross-sectional association between psychological distress and inflammatory proteins in a young, healthy representative population of English adults. Method Participants were 1338 individuals aged 16–34 years from the 2006 Health Survey for England (HSE). Blood samples to measure plasma fibrinogen and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), as well as measures of psychological distress (using the General Health Questionnaire 12-item scale, GHQ-12) and covariates, were collected during home visits. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between psychological distress and fibrinogen and hsCRP. Results Higher self-rated distress was positively associated with fibrinogen level in this young population, independently of age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, smoking, and alcohol and medication use (β=0.024, p &lt;0.01). Psychological distress was not related to hsCRP. Conclusions Psychological distress may negatively impact inflammatory processes in young adulthood before the onset of chronic health problems such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Longitudinal research is needed to elucidate the relationship between distress and inflammation in young adults and its significance for later disease states.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":29},"references":51,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
