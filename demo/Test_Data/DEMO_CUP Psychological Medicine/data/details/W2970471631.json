To answer this question, we compared the predictive accuracy between the outcome of conversion and poor functioning by using the NAPLS-2 risk calculator. Methods Three hundred CHR individuals were identified using the Chinese version of the Structured Interview for Prodromal Symptoms. Of these, 228 (76.0%) completed neurocognitive assessments at baseline and 199 (66.3%) had at least a 1-year follow-up assessment. The latter group was used in the NAPLS-2 risk calculator. Results We divided the sample into two broad categories based on different outcome definitions, conversion ( n = 46) v. non-conversion ( n = 153) or recovery ( n = 138) v. poor functioning ( n = 61). Interestingly, the NAPLS-2 risk calculator showed moderate discrimination of subsequent conversion to psychosis in this sample with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.631 ( p = 0.007). However, for discriminating poor functioning, the AUC of the model increased to 0.754 ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Our results suggest that the current risk calculator was a better fit for predicting a poor functional outcome and treatment response than it was in the prediction of conversion to psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":17},"references":29,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
