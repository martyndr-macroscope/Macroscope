A single, nominated hour's observation seemed to fit the data satisfactorily. This method, when applied to data from two newly observed contrasting samples, revealed the same important differences as had been found from a whole day's observation. A practical, short observation method thus emerged for use in research and training.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":38},"references":3,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
