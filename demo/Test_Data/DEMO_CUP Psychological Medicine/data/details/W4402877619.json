This study examined plasma drug concentrations of a dose-tapering trial which exhibited the potential of successful maintenance under lower antipsychotic dosages. Methods A 2-year open-label randomized prospective trial recruited remitted patients to undergo guided antipsychotic tapering. Blood samples were collected at baseline, annually, and after each dose reduction. Plasma aripiprazole/dehydroaripiprazole concentrations were determined using LC–MS/MS. The relationship between the dose and serum drug levels was examined using Spearman's correlation. Divided at 120 ng/mL, relapse rate, global function, quality of life, and psychopathology were compared between high- and low- drug level groups. Results A total of 126 blood samples were collected, after excluding13 samples due of non-adherence. The correlation coefficients between dosage and drug level were 0.853 (aripiprazole) and 0.864 (dehydroaripiprazole), and the dose and concentration plots were parallel along the tapering trajectories, except patients with non-adherence. The concentration-to-dose ratio of aripiprazole in this cohort, 17.79 ± 7.23 ng/mL/mg, was higher than that in Caucasian populations. No significant differences were observed in the clinical outcomes between the high- and low-level groups. Remarkably, 12 of 15 patients maintained remission at plasma aripiprazole concentrations of &lt;120 ng/mL. Conclusions The lower-than-expected doses reached in our antipsychotic tapering trial were substantiated to provide adequate prophylactic effects by TDM results in a subset of patients treated with aripiprazole, even considering the differences in pharmacogenomics between ethnicities.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":65,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
