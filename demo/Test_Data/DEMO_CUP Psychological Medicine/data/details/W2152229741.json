Method The clinical symptoms and cognitive performance of participants were evaluated at admission to one of two university teaching hospitals and again at 3 months after remission and discharge. A total of 52 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder, aged between 20 and 60 years and with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score ⩾17 entered the study. The sample for this paper comprises the 48 subjects (mean age 37.9 years, s.d .=10.7) who received admission and follow-up assessments; an attrition rate of 7.7%. Results More perseverative errors on the shortened Wisconsin Card Sorting Test at admission predicted a worse clinical outcome at follow-up. Poor event-based prospective memory and more perseverative errors on the shortened Wisconsin Card Sorting Test at admission predicted worse social and occupational outcome at follow-up. Conclusions These results suggest that a brief cognitive screen at hospital admission, focusing on executive function, would have a useful prognostic value in depression. Determining early predictors of individuals at risk of poorer outcomes is important for identifying those who may need altered or additional treatment approaches.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":96},"references":60,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
