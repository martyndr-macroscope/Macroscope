Methods Prevalence of alcohol misuse was estimated among 4645 US Army soldiers who participated in a longitudinal survey. Assessment occurred 1–2 months before soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2012 (T0), upon their return to the USA (T1), 3 months later (T2), and 9 months later (T3). Weights-adjusted logistic regression was used to evaluate associations of hypothesized risk factors with post-deployment incidence and persistence of heavy drinking (HD) (consuming 5 + alcoholic drinks at least 1–2×/week) and alcohol or substance use disorder (AUD/SUD). Results Prevalence of past-month HD at T0, T2, and T3 was 23.3% ( s.e . = 0.7%), 26.1% ( s.e . = 0.8%), and 22.3% ( s.e . = 0.7%); corresponding estimates for any binge drinking (BD) were 52.5% ( s.e . = 1.0%), 52.5% ( s.e . = 1.0%), and 41.3% ( s.e . = 0.9%). Greater personal life stress during deployment (e.g., relationship, family, or financial problems) – but not combat stress – was associated with new onset of HD at T2 [per standard score increase: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.20, 95% CI 1.06–1.35, p = 0.003]; incidence of AUD/SUD at T2 (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.25–1.89, p &lt; 0.0005); and persistence of AUD/SUD at T2 and T3 (AOR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.08–1.56, p = 0.005). Any BD pre-deployment was associated with post-deployment onset of HD (AOR = 3.21, 95% CI 2.57–4.02, p &lt; 0.0005) and AUD/SUD (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.27–2.70, p = 0.001). Conclusions Alcohol misuse is common during the months preceding and following deployment. Timely intervention aimed at alleviating/managing personal stressors or curbing risky drinking might reduce risk of alcohol-related problems post-deployment.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":24},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
