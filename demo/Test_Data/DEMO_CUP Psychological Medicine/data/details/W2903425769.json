Methods We established a prospective cohort of 1 796 257 Swedish residents born between 1982 and 1996, followed from their 15th birthday, or immigration to Sweden after age 15, until diagnosis, emigration, death, or end of 2011. Cox proportional hazards models were used to model hazard ratios by migration-related factors, adjusted for covariates. Results All psychotic disorders were elevated among migrants and their children compared with Swedish-born individuals, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] migrants : 2.20, 95% CI 1.96–2.47; aHR children : 2.00, 95% CI 1.79–2.25), affective psychotic disorders (aHR migrant 1.42, 95% CI 1.25–1.63; aHR children : 1.22 95% CI 1.07–1.40), and other non-affective psychotic disorders (aHR migrant : 1.97, 95% CI 1.81–2.14; aHR children : 1.68, 95% CI 1.54–1.83). For all psychotic disorders, risks were generally highest in migrants from Africa (i.e. aHR schizophrenia : 5.24, 95% CI 4.26–6.45) and elevated at most ages-of-migration. By contrast, risk of non-psychotic bipolar disorders was lower for migrants (aHR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.52–0.64) overall, and across all ages-of-migration except infancy (aHR: 1.20; 95% CI 1.01–1.42), while risk for their children was similar to the Swedish-born population (aHR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.93–1.08). Conclusions Increased risk of psychiatric disorders associated with migration and minority status may be specific to psychotic disorders, with exact risk dependent on the region of origin.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":53},"references":61,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
