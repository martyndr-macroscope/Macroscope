Patients were compared on demographic characteristics, diagnosis, incidence of violence and suicidal attempts, treatment, length of stay and previous admissions. The results suggest that patients admitted to the mental hospital are more likely to be single, male, of lower socio-economic status and to suffer from more chronic conditions. There is also a higher incidence of violence among patients admitted to the mental hospital. These findings have implications for the types of changes that will be required in general hospital units if the role of mental hospitals continues to decline.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":22},"references":36,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
