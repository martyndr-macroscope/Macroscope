There are probably a number of reasons for the sustained interest. First, psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are often chronic or recurring (Mason et al . 1996), are associated with significant disability (Keith et al . 1991) and they place a considerable burden upon the community at large (Hall et al . 1985; Knapp, 1997). Secondly, over the past few decades, high rates of cannabis use and use disorders have been observed among persons with schizophrenia and other psychoses (Barbee et al . 1989; Fowler et al . 1998), suggesting the possibility that cannabis use may be causally related to psychotic disorders. Thirdly, given what is known about the psychotomimetic effects of cannabis (Hall et al . 2001), it is plausible that high doses of cannabis may produce psychotic symptoms. Finally, clinical research with persons with psychotic disorders has found that problematical substance use is correlated with a range of negative outcomes including relapse, rehospitalization, poor medication compliance, poorer social functioning and increased treatment costs (Salyers &amp; Mueser, 2001), suggesting drug use may be related to worsened clinical outcomes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":34},"references":40,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
