There appears to be a range of abnormal or non-antisocial stealing behaviours, all with impulsive and/or compulsive features. Kleptomania, as defined by modern criteria, may represent the most compulsive variant. Kleptomania may be related to mood disorder, and might be a form of ‘affective spectrum disorder’.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":136},"references":113,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
