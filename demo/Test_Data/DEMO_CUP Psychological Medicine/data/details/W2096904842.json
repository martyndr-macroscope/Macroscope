However, of 18 specific attitudes to psychiatry, only one changed significantly overall – fewer students agreed that ‘psychiatrists are held in poor regard by most other doctors’. Contrary to other reports, these preliminary findings suggest that a psychiatric clerkship may be followed by stable attitudes and intent towards the specialty.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":52},"references":8,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
