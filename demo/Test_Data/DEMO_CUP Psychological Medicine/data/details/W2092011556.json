In manic-depressive patients concentrations of salivary electrolytes were measured. Salivation rates were decreased in untreated endogenous depression and mania. After remission by ECT but not by drug treatment flow rates increased towards normal values. Estimations of electrolytes revealed no specific pattern of excretion in manic-depressive patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":43},"references":31,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
