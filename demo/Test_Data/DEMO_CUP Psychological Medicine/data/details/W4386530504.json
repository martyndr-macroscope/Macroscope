Our aim was to investigate long-term GMV changes over a 2-year period after ECT administration and their associations with clinical outcome. Methods In this nonrandomized longitudinal study, patients with MDD undergoing ECT ( n = 17) are assessed three times by structural MRI: Before ECT ( t 0 ), after ECT ( t 1 ) and 2 years later ( t 2 ). A healthy ( n = 21) and MDD non-ECT ( n = 33) control group are also measured three times within an equivalent time interval. A 3(group) × 3(time) ANOVA on whole-brain level and correlation analyses with clinical outcome variables is performed. Results Analyses yield a significant group × time interaction ( p FWE &lt; 0.001) resulting from significant volume increases from t 0 to t 1 and decreases from t 1 to t 2 in the ECT group, e.g., in limbic areas. There are no effects of time in both control groups. Volume increases from t 0 to t 1 correlate with immediate and delayed symptom increase, while volume decreases from t 1 to t 2 correlate with long-term depressive outcome (all p ⩽ 0.049). Conclusions Volume increases induced by ECT appear to be a transient phenomenon as volume strongly decreased 2 years after ECT. Short-term volume increases are associated with less symptom improvement suggesting that the antidepressant effect of ECT is not due to volume changes. Larger volume decreases are associated with poorer long-term outcome highlighting the interplay between disease progression and structural changes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":7},"references":46,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
