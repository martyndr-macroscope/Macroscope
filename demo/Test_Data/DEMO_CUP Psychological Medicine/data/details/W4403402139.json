However, discrepancies between study findings likely to results from both small sample sizes and the use of different functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks. To address these issues, data-driven meta-analytic approach designed to identify homogeneous brain co-activity patterns across tasks was conducted to better characterize the common and distinct alterations between these disorders. Methods A hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted to identify groups of studies reporting similar neuroimaging results, independent of task type and psychiatric diagnosis. A traditional meta-analysis (activation likelihood estimation) was then performed within each of these groups of studies to extract their aberrant activation maps. Results A total of 762 fMRI study contrasts were targeted, comprising 13 991 patients with SMDs. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified 5 groups of studies (meta-analytic groupings; MAGs) being characterized by distinct aberrant activation patterns across SMDs: (1) emotion processing; (2) cognitive processing; (3) motor processes, (4) reward processing, and (5) visual processing. While MAG1 was mostly commonly impaired, MAG2 was more impaired in schizophrenia, while MAG3 and MAG5 revealed no differences between disorder. MAG4 showed the strongest between-diagnoses differences, particularly in the striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions SMDs are characterized mostly by common deficits in brain networks, although differences between disorders are also present. This study highlights the importance of studying SMDs simultaneously rather than independently.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":75,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
