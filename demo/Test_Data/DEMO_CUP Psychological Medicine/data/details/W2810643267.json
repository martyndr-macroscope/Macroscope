We report the first randomized controlled trial of ACT in mainland China. Methods Sixty outpatients with schizophrenia with severe functional impairments or frequent hospitalizations were randomly assigned to ACT ( n = 30) or standard community treatment ( n = 30). The severity of symptoms and level of social functioning were assessed at baseline and every 3 months during the 1-year study. The primary outcome was the duration of hospital readmission. Secondary outcomes included a pre-post change in symptom severity, the rates of symptom relapse and gainful employment, social and occupational functioning, and quality of life of family caregivers. Results Based on a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the outcomes for ACT were significantly better than those of standard community treatment. ACT patients were less likely to be readmitted [3.3% (1/30) v . 25.0% (7/28), Fisher's exact test p = 0.023], had a shorter mean readmission time [2.4 (13.3) v . 30.7 (66.9) days], were less likely to relapse [6.7% (2/30) v . 28.6% (8/28), Fisher's exact test p = 0.038], and had shorter mean time in relapse [3.5 (14.6) v . 34.4 (70.6) days]. The ACT group also had significantly longer times re-employed and greater symptomatic improvement and their caregivers experienced a greater improvement in their quality of life. Conclusion Our results show that culturally adapted ACT is both feasible and effective for individuals with severe schizophrenia in urban China. Replication studies with larger samples and longer duration of follow up are warranted.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":34},"references":53,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
