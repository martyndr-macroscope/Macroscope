Depression was common on both occasions, and was characterized by dysphoria, pessimism and somatic symptoms, but not guilt or self-blame. Depression and disability were associated on both occasions. The relationship between changes in disability and depression across time was complex. In trying to understand changes in depression, the absolute change in disability may be less important than the relative change and rate of change. The results were discussed in relation to findings from other disease groups, and the implications for the clinical management of depression in Parkinson's disease.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":194},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
