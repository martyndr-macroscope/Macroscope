Blocking dopamine D 2 receptors dampens psychotic symptoms and normalises reward disturbances, but a direct relationship between D 2 receptor blockade, normalisation of reward processing and symptom improvement has not yet been demonstrated. The current study examined the association between blockade of D 2 receptors in the caudate nucleus, alterations in reward processing and the psychopathology in a longitudinal study of antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia patients. Methods Twenty-two antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia patients (10 males, mean age 23.3) and 23 healthy controls (12 males, mean age 23.5) were examined with single-photon emission computed tomography using 123 I-labelled iodobenzamide. Reward disturbances were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a modified version of the monetary-incentive-delay task. Patients were assessed before and after 6 weeks of treatment with amisulpride. Results In line with previous results, patients had a lower fMRI response at baseline (0.2 ± 0.5 v. 0.7 ± 0.6; p = 0.008), but not at follow-up (0.5 ± 0.6 v. 0.6 ± 0.7), and a change in the fMRI signal correlated with improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive symptoms ( ρ = −0.435, p = 0.049). In patients responding to treatment, a correlation between improvement in the fMRI signal and receptor occupancy was found ( ρ = 0.588; p = 0.035). Conclusion The results indicate that salience abnormalities play a role in the reward system in schizophrenia. In patients responding to a treatment-induced blockade of dopamine D 2 receptors, the psychotic symptoms may be ameliorated by normalising salience abnormalities in the reward system.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":25},"references":59,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
