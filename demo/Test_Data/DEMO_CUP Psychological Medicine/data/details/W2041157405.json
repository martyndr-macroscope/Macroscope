Patients with affective disorders showed reduced right ear sensitivity, while schizophrenic patients did not show reduced sensitivity. Lower sensitivity correlated with higher structured-interview ratings of speech retardation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":11},"references":38,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
