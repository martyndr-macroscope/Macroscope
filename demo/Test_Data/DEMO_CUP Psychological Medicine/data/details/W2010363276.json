Both methods distinguished between the schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic speech. Fourth word deletion gave lower scores overall and this effect was significantly greater for the more disorganized schizophrenic speech. An encoding deficit involving inappropriate repetition is discussed as a possible explanation for the findings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":28},"references":21,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
