A large majority reported at the end of the interview that it had no adverse effect on their emotional state. About 4% reported that it made them distressed, 1% that it depressed them, and 2% that it had intruded on their privacy. By contrast, 52% said it had made them feel good about themselves. Distress seemed to be largely related to performing poorly on cognitive tests. There is no information on the duration of these effects in the period following the interview. It is recommended that respondents in community surveys, including the elderly, be informed that they can decline to answer any question, and that interviewers be trained in how to respond to the few who will be distressed by the experience.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":42},"references":8,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
