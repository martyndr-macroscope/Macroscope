The GP identified a psychiatric component in the reason for consultation in 40% of the sample, and he regarded 24% as ‘psychiatric cases’. The estimated true prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the sample was 34%. These data are used as the basis for a theoretical discussion of prescriptive screening strategies for psychiatric disorder in general practice.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":128},"references":31,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
