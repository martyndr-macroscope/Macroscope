REM is disrupted in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and REM abnormalities after traumatic events increase the risk of developing PTSD. Therefore, it was hypothesized that abnormal REM in trauma-exposed individuals may pave the way for PTSD by interfering with the processing of extinction memory. In addition, PTSD patients display reduced vagal activity. Vagal activity contributes to the strengthening of memories, including fear extinction memory, and recent studies show that the role of vagus in memory processing extends to memory consolidation during sleep. Therefore, it is plausible that reduced vagal activity during sleep in trauma-exposed individuals may be an additional mechanism that impairs extinction memory consolidation. However, to date, the contribution of sleep vagal activity to the consolidation of extinction memory or any emotional memory has not been investigated. Methods Trauma-exposed individuals ( n = 113) underwent a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction protocol. Conditioning and extinction learning phases were followed by extinction recall 24 h later. The association of extinction recall with REM characteristics and REM vagal activity (indexed as heart rate variability) during the intervening consolidation night was examined. Results Consistent with our hypotheses, REM disruption was associated with poorer physiological and explicit extinction memory. Furthermore, higher vagal activity during REM was associated with better explicit extinction memory, and physiological extinction memory in males. Conclusions These findings support the notion that abnormal REM, including reduced REM vagal activity, may contribute to PTSD by impairing the consolidation of extinction memory.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":3},"references":118,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
