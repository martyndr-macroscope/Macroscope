A sub-sample of 71 patients was given a comprehensive postal and case record follow-up 5 years later. When patients developing organic and other complicating illnesses were excluded, those suffering from psychotic depression showed a significantly poorer outcome, as defined by relapse and required lengths of hospital care, than those diagnosed as suffering from neurotic depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":36},"references":16,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
