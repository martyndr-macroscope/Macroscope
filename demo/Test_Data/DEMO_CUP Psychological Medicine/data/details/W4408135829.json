Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS), a multifrequency sonication technique, is approved for the clinical treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we present the largest real-world retrospective analysis of ultrasound neuromodulation therapy in dementia (AD, vascular, mixed) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods The consecutive sample involved 58 patients already receiving state-of-the-art treatment in an open-label, uncontrolled, retrospective study. TPS therapy typically comprises 10 sessions (range 8–12) with individualized MRI-based target areas defined according to brain pathology and individual pathophysiology. We compared the CERAD-Plus neuropsychological test battery results before and after treatment, with the CERAD Corrected Total Score ( CTS) as the primary outcome. Furthermore, we analyzed side effects reported by patients during the treatment period. Results CERAD Corrected Total Score (CTS) significantly improved ( p = .017, d = .32) after treatment (Baseline: M = 56.56, SD = 18.56; Post-treatment: M = 58.65, SD = 19.44). The group of top-responders (top quartile) improved even by 9.8 points. Fewer than one-third of all patients reported any sensation during treatment. Fatigue and transient headaches were the most common, with no severe adverse events. Conclusions The findings implicate TPS as a novel and safe add-on therapy for patients with dementia or MCI with the potential to further improve current state-of-the-art treatment results. Despite the individual benefits, further randomized, sham-controlled, longitudinal clinical trials are needed to differentiate the effects of verum and placebo.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":30,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
