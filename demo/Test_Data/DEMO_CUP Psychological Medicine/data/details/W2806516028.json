Work in this area has facilitated the adoption of the clinical staging model of early clinical phenotypes, ranging from at-risk mental states to chronic and severe mental illness. It has been a topic of debate if these staging models should be conceptualised as disorder-specific or transdiagnostic. In order to inform this debate and facilitate cross-diagnostic discourse, the present scoping review provides a broad overview of the body of literature of (a) longitudinal at-risk approaches and (b) identified antecedents of (homotypic) illness progression across three major mental disorders [psychosis, bipolar disorder (BD) and depression], and places these in the context of clinical staging. Stage 0 at-risk conceptualisations (i.e. familial high-risk approaches) were identified in all three disorders. However, formalised stage 1b conceptualisations (i.e. ultra-high-risk approaches) were only present in psychosis and marginally in BD. The presence of non-specific and overlapping antecedents in the three disorders may support a general staging model, at least in the early stages of severe psychotic or mood disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":77},"references":226,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
