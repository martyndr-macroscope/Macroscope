Control subjects who denied heavy drinking were used to study test-retest reliability of a group who admitted that drinking was a problem and a third group who admitted heavy drinking but denied problem drinking. Non-heavy drinkers and the heaviest drinkers are shown to be the most reliable and the intermediate group least reliable.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":3},"references":36,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
