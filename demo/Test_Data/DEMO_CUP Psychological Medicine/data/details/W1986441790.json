Those attending a general practitioner are shown to be more psychiatrically disturbed than a random sample of the practice population, and this difference remains when those attending for psychological symptoms are discounted. Various social and demographic characteristics which distinguish between those who do and those who do not attend a doctor with a given set of psychological symptoms are described.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":15,"cited_by_count":201},"references":17,"networkCitations":15,"seed":false}
