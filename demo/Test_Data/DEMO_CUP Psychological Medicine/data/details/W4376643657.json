It follows that identification of treatment-resistant aberrant neural processes in MDD may inform clinical and research efforts targeting sustained remission. Thus, we sought to identify brain regions showing aberrant neural functioning in MDD that either (1) fail to exhibit substantive change (nonresponse) or (2) exhibit functional changes (response) following CBT. Methods To identify treatment-resistant neural processes (as well as neural processes exhibiting change after treatment), we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of MDD patients ( n = 58) before and after CBT as well as never-depressed controls ( n = 35) before and after a similar amount of time. We evaluated fMRI data using conjunction analyses, which utilized several contrast-based criteria to characterize brain regions showing both differences between patients and controls at baseline and nonresponse or response to CBT. Results Findings revealed nonresponse in a cerebellar region and response in prefrontal and parietal regions. Conclusions Results are consistent with prior theoretical models of CBT's direct effect on cortical regulatory processes but expand on them with identification of additional regions (and associated neural systems) of response and nonresponse to CBT.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":99,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
