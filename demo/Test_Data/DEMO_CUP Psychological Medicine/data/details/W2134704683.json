Mean plasma prolactin levels, as measured by radioimmunoassay, were within the normal range, although mean plasma levels of luteinizing hormone were depressed. This association is of interest as it suggests that basal levels of circulating prolactin are not affected by the hypothalamic disorder found in patients with anorexia nervosa.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":34},"references":17,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
