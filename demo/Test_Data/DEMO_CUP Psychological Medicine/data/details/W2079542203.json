Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (iCBT) may be able to bridge this gap. Method Seventy-six students with bulimia nervosa (BN) or eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) were randomly assigned to immediate iCBT with e-mail support over 3 months or to a 3-month waiting list followed by iCBT [waiting list/delayed treatment control (WL/DTC)]. ED outcomes were assessed with the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Other outcomes included depression, anxiety and quality of life. Results Students who had immediate iCBT showed significantly greater improvements at 3 and 6 months than those receiving WL/DTC in ED and other symptoms. Conclusions iCBT with e-mail support is efficacious in students with bulimic disorders and has lasting effects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":149},"references":43,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
