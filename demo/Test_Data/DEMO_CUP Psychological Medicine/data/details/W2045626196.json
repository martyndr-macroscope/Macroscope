The first section of the paper analyses some of the problems which arise with those elements which can be measured in monetary terms – the ‘hard’ costs and benefits. The second section looks at a method of presenting the less tangible effects – the ‘soft’ costs and benefits. Finally, it is suggested how these can be brought together to aid rational decision-making.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":40},"references":5,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
