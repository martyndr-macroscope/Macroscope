The rate of increase of consulting decreases as the severity of MPM increases. There is an interaction between age and MPM, giving progressively increased consulting rates in the older age groups in males but not females. The possibility of a biological difference between males and females in the interaction of MPM and physical, and of age and physical illness, is raised.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":17},"references":41,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
