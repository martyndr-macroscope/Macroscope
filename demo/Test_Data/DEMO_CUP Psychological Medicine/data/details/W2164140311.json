Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy may be a promising approach for the treatment of subthreshold depression. The current study had two aims: (1) to determine whether an internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy intervention and a group cognitive behaviour therapy intervention are more effective than a waiting-list control group; and (2) to determine whether the effect of the internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy differs from the group cognitive behaviour therapy intervention. Method A total of 191 women and 110 men with subthreshold depression were randomized into internet-based treatment, group cognitive behaviour therapy (Lewinsohn's Coping With Depression course), or a waiting-list control condition. The main outcome measure was treatment response after 10 weeks, defined as the difference in pre- and post-treatment scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Missing data, a major limitation of this study, were imputed using the Multiple Imputation (MI) procedure Data Augmentation. Results In the waiting-list control group, we found a pre- to post-improvement effect size of 0·45, which was 0·65 in the group cognitive behaviour therapy condition and 1·00 within the internet-based treatment condition. Helmert contrasts showed a significant difference between the waiting-list condition and the two treatment conditions ( p =0·04) and no significant difference between both treatment conditions ( p =0·62). Conclusions An internet-based intervention may be at least as effective as a commonly used group cognitive behaviour therapy intervention for subthreshold depression in people over 50 years of age.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":311},"references":37,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
