The aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal association between sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms in a nationally representative sample. Method Data from the 18-month follow-up of the UK National Psychiatric Morbidity survey were used ( n = 2406). Sleep disturbances, depressive and other psychiatric symptoms (fatigue, concentration problems, irritability, anxiety and pain symptoms) were assessed using the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). The bidirectional association between symptoms was investigated with logistic regression analyses and path analysis. Results Sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms were correlated with each other cross-sectionally ( r = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001). In the longitudinal analysis, sleep disturbances at baseline did not predict depressive symptoms at follow-up [odds ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51–3.19] and the same was observed for the reciprocal association (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56–1.35). In the path analysis, the reciprocal model did not have a better fit compared to the simpler first-order model without cross-lagged paths. The path from sleep disturbances at baseline to depressive symptoms at follow-up had a minimal contribution to the explained variance of the latter (&lt;1%). Conclusions Previous studies may have overestimated the importance of sleep disturbances as an independent risk factor of depression. The strong cross-sectional association is compatible with sleep disturbances being either a prodromal or a residual symptom of depression and this may have implications for recognition and treatment of depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":35},"references":37,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
