Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) such as mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a using the passive oddball paradigm have been studied in children and adolescents with ADHD. Still, there is no such data for adults with ADHD. This study aimed to compare the MMN and P3a and their clinical and neurocognitive correlations between drug-naive adults with ADHD and control adults. Methods We recruited 52 adults with ADHD (26.5 ± 6.2 years), and 62 age-matched controls (25.6 ± 5.6 years). They received the psychiatric interviews, auditory ERP, the Conners' continuous performance test (CCPT), and the Cambridge gambling test (CGT). They also completed the questionnaires about ADHD symptoms and real-world executive functions. MMN and P3a were assessed during a passive duration-deviant auditory oddball paradigm from the midline electrodes Cz. Results Adults with ADHD demonstrated smaller Cz MMN amplitude, more severe ADHD symptoms, poorer attention profiles (CCPT), and a wide range of executive dysfunctions than controls. As for the correlates, Cz peak amplitude of MMN correlated with inattention symptoms, executive dysfunctions, attentional vigilance (CCPT), and decision-making (CGT) in ADHD adults but only with decision-making in controls. Conclusions Our findings that smaller amplitude of MMN and its differential associated pattern with inattention, real-world executive dysfunction, and decision-making, in drug-naive adults with ADHD from adult controls, provide evidence to support the potential electrophysiological biomarker for adult ADHD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":15},"references":86,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
