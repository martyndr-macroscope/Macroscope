However, limited effort has been made to explore the effects of possible interactions between diet and microbiome on the risks of depression and anxiety. Methods Using the latest genome-wide association studies findings in gut microbiome and dietary habits, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) analysis of gut microbiome and dietary habits was conducted in the UK Biobank cohort. Logistic/linear regression models were applied for evaluating the associations for gut microbiome-PRS, dietary habits-PRS, and their interactions with depression/anxiety status and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)/Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) score by R software. Results We observed 51 common diet–gut microbiome interactions shared by both PHQ score and depression status, such as overall beef intake × genus Sporobacter [hurdle binary (HB)] ( P PHQ = 7.88 × 10 −4 , P depression status = 5.86 × 10 −4 ); carbohydrate × genus Lactococcus (HB) ( P PHQ = 0.0295, P depression status = 0.0150). We detected 41 common diet–gut microbiome interactions shared by GAD score and anxiety status, such as sugar × genus Parasutterella (rank normal transformed) ( P GAD = 5.15 × 10 −3 , P anxiety status = 0.0347); tablespoons of raw vegetables per day × family Coriobacteriaceae (HB) ( P GAD = 6.02 × 10 −4 , P anxiety status = 0.0345). Some common significant interactions shared by depression and anxiety were identified, such as overall beef intake × genus Sporobacter (HB). Conclusions Our study results expanded our understanding of how to comprehensively consider the relationships for dietary habits–gut microbiome interactions with depression and anxiety.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":14},"references":71,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
