The patients were classified according to their family history (Winokur's classification) and the Newcastle scale. There was a significant increase in urinary free cortisol (UFC) excretion in patients classified as endogenous on the Newcastle scale, but UFC excretion was normal in patients with neurotic depression. No significant relationship between urinary free cortisol and the Winokur classification was observed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":13},"references":14,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
