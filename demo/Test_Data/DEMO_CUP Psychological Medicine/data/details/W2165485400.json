The EAT-26 was administered to 995 high school students. This was followed by individual interviews with those who scored in the symptomatic range. Fifty-one students with PS eating disorders, 57 students without eating disorders (normal controls) and 30 hospital patients with FS, anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa were compared on subscales of the Eating Disorder Inventory, the Diagnostic Survey for Eating Disorders and the Beck Depression Inventory. The three groups displayed statistically significant differences on dimensions of EDI subscales Ineffectiveness and Interoceptive Awareness and also with respect to depression, history of being overweight and past history of emotional problems, as well as having mothers with medical illnesses. On these characteristics, the FS subjects displayed higher levels than the PS subjects, who in turn were higher than the NC subjects. The PS subjects displayed elevations on Body Dissatisfaction (EDI subscale), past medical illnesses, and mother's over-concern with eating and weight. These data support a continuum model of the eating disorders, but a continuum of multiple associated features rather than of dieting.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":137},"references":41,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
