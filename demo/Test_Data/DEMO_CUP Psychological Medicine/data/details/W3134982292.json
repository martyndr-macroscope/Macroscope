Previous research is limited by small populations, not controlling for previous depression, and relying on the same informant for reporting exposure and outcome. This study aims to examine the relationship between objectively measured workplace factors and the risk of developing clinical depression among the Swedish working population while controlling for previous psychiatric diagnoses and sociodemographic factors. Methods Control, demands, and job strain were measured using the Swedish Job Exposure Matrix (JEM) measuring psychosocial workload linked to around 3 million individuals based on their occupational titles in 2005. Cox regression models were built to estimate associations between these factors and diagnoses of depression recorded in patient registers. Results Lower job control was associated with an increased risk of developing depression (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.39–1.48 and HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.24–1.30 for men and women with the lowest control, respectively), and this showed a dose–response relationship among men. Having high job demands was associated with a slight decrease in depression risk for men and women. High strain and passive jobs (both low control jobs) were associated with an increased risk of depression among men, and passive jobs were associated with an increased risk among women. Conclusion High job control appears important for reducing the risk of developing depression even when accounting for previous psychiatric diagnoses and sociodemographic factors. This is an important finding concerning strategies to improve occupational and in turn mental health.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":72},"references":33,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
