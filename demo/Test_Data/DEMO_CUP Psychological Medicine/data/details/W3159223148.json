Although self-reports typically suggest AN patients have a reduced appetitive response, behavioral and neurophysiological measures have revealed evidence for both increased and reduced attentional biases towards food stimuli. The mechanisms influencing food perception in AN, might be clarified using time-sensitive magnetoencephalography (MEG) to differentiate the early (more automatic processing) stages from the late (more controlled) stages. Methods MEG was recorded in 22 partially weight-restored adolescent AN patients and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control (HC) participants during a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm using 100 high-calorie food, 100 low-calorie food, and 100 non-food pictures. Neural sources of event-related fields were estimated using the L2-Minimum-Norm method and analyzed in early (50–300 ms) and late (350–500 ms) time intervals. Results AN patients rated high-calorie food as less palatable and reported overall less food craving than HC participants. Nevertheless, in response to food pictures AN patients showed relative increased neural activity in the left occipito-temporal and inferior frontal regions in the early time interval. No group differences occurred in the late time interval. Conclusions MEG results speak against an overall reduced motivational response to food in AN. Instead, relative increased early food processing in the visual cortex suggests greater motivated attention. A greater appetitive response to food might be an adaptive mechanism in a state of undernourishment. Yet, this relative increased food processing in AN was no longer present later, arguably reflecting rapid downregulation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":8},"references":64,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
