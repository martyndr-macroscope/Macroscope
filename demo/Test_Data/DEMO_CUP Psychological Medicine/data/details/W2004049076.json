We sought to determine whether a brief psycho-educational intervention reduced disability in patients with benign palpitation. Method. In a pragmatic randomized controlled trial within a cardiology clinic at a district general hospital, 80 consecutive patients diagnosed as having benign palpitation – either palpitation due to awareness of extrasystoles or sinus rhythm – with associated distress or disability were randomized to an intervention group (usual care plus nurse-delivered intervention based on cognitive-behavioural principles) or to a control group (usual care). Principal outcome was difference in proportion of participants with good or excellent researcher-rated activity levels at 3 months. Subsidiary outcomes were self-rated symptoms, distress and disability, researcher-rated unmet treatment needs. Results. The principal outcome showed a statistically and clinically significant benefit for the intervention group, with a number needed to treat of 3 (95% CIs 2 to 7). All but one subsidiary outcomes also showed a difference in favour of the intervention group, and several differences reached statistical significance. Significantly more of the control group had unmet treatment needs at 3 months. Conclusions. A brief, nurse-delivered, psycho-educational intervention, was an effective treatment for benign palpitation. Further evaluation, including assessment of cost-effectiveness, is needed. The findings have application to the care of patients presenting with other types of ‘unexplained’ medical symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":26},"references":4,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
