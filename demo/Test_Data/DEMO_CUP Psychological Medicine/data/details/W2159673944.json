It is suggested that further work could be undertaken with a longer period of treatment, and at a higher dosage level of co-dergocrine, in a younger patient sample.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":14,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
