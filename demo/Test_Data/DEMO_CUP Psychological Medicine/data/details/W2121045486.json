It was found that, even 40 years after the traumatic experience, this group of survivors exhibited a slightly higher degree of emotional disorders than controls who were not under Nazi occupation during WWII. These long-term effects were usually more prominent in women than in men, and the relationship to age was minimal.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":51},"references":23,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
