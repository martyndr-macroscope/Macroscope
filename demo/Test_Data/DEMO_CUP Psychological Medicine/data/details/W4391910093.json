The abnormality of spatiotemporal networks in patients with MDD remains largely unclear. Methods We investigated the alterations of the global spatiotemporal network in MDD patients using a large-sample multicenter resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset. The spatiotemporal characteristics were measured by the variability of global signal (GS) and its correlation with local signals (GSCORR) at multiple frequency bands. The association between these indicators and clinical scores was further assessed. Results The GS fluctuations were reduced in patients with MDD across the full frequency range (0–0.1852 Hz). The GSCORR was also reduced in the MDD group, especially in the relatively higher frequency range (0.0728–0.1852 Hz). Interestingly, these indicators showed positive correlations with depressive scores in the MDD group and relative negative correlations in the control group. Conclusion The GS and its spatiotemporal effects on local signals were weakened in patients with MDD, which may impair inter-regional synchronization and related functions. Patients with severe depression may use the compensatory mechanism to make up for the functional impairments.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":93,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
