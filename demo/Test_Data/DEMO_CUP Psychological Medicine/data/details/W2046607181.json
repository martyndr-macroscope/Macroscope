A greater right ear sensitivity than left was exhibited, although right ear superiority diminished with repeated testing over weeks while left ear thresholds remained relatively stable. The results of acoustic impedance measures suggest that these findings are not associated with peripheral outer and middle ear disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":8},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
