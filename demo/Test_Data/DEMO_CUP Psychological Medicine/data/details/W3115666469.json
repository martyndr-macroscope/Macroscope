Methods We analyzed 1558 functional brain measurements using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy during a verbal fluency task from 1200 participants with three disease spectra [196 schizophrenia, 189 bipolar disorder (BPD), and 394 major depressive disorder (MDD)] and 369 healthy controls along with demographic characteristics (age, gender, premorbid IQ, and handedness), task performance during the measurements, clinical assessments, and medication equivalent doses (chlorpromazine, diazepam, biperiden, and imipramine) in a consistent manner. The association between brain functions and demographic and clinical variables was tested using a general linear mixed model (GLMM). Then, the direction of relationship between brain activity and symptom severity, controlling for any other associations, was estimated using a model comparison of structural equation models (SEMs). Results The GLMM showed a shared functional deficit of brain activity and a schizophrenia-specific delayed activity timing in the prefrontal cortex (false discovery rate-corrected p &lt; 0.05). Comparison of SEMs showed that brain activity was associated with the global assessment of functioning scores in the left inferior frontal gyrus opercularis (IFGOp) in BPD group and the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, and the left superior frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus triangularis, and IFGOp in MDD group. Conclusion This cross-disease large-sample neuroimaging study with high-quality clinical data reveals a robust relationship between prefrontal function and behavioral outcomes across three major psychiatric disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":22},"references":52,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
