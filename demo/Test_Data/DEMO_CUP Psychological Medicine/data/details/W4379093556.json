Here, we review functional MRI studies that investigated key psychological factors that have been consistently linked to resilience to severe adversity and trauma exposure. These domains include emotion regulation (including cognitive reappraisal), reward responsivity, and cognitive control. Further, we briefly review functional imaging evidence related to emerging areas of study that may potentially facilitate resilience: namely social cognition, active coping, and successful fear extinction. Finally, we also touch upon ongoing issues in neuroimaging study design that will need to be addressed to enable us to harness insight from such studies to improve treatments for – or, ideally, guard against the development of – debilitating post-traumatic stress syndromes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":19},"references":161,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
