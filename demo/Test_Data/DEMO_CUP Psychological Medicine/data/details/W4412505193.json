In this study, we sought to characterize IIV in BD by examining whether it differs from healthy controls (HCs) and is associated with other cognitive measures, clinical variables, and white matter microstructure. Methods Two hundred and seventeen adults, including 100 BD outpatients and 117 HCs, completed processing speed, sustained attention, working memory, and executive function tasks. A subsample of 55 BD participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging. IIV was operationalized as the individual standard deviation in reaction time on the Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs version. Results BD participants had significantly increased IIV compared to age-matched controls. Increased IIV was associated with poorer mean performance scores on processing speed, sustained attention, working memory, and executive function tasks, as well as two whole-brain white matter indices: fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity. Conclusions IIV is increased in BD and appears to correlate with other cognitive variables, as well as white matter measures that index reduced structural integrity and demyelination. Thus, IIV may represent a neurobiologically informative cognitive measure for BD research that is worthy of further investigation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":75,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
