Symptoms were identified which had a high or low prevalence at 3-month follow-up. GHQ and PSE scores correlated at 0·8. The implications of the study are discussed, particularly the earlier need for out-patient help in those who had a moderate or high number of symptoms at initial interview.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":84},"references":15,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
