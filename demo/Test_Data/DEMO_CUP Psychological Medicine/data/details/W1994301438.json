No significant difference between the groups was demonstrated. When the data from both groups of schizophrenics were combined, a significant correlation was found between 2 measures of the Verbal Transformation Effect and the P-score of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":15},"references":14,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
