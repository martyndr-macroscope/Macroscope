Hospital treatment and disposal were examined in the light of the doctors' reasons for referral, and of the expectations which they and the patients had held of the hospital service. The findings are related to previous work in this field, and the implications for service planning discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":84},"references":45,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
