The measure classifies persons according to their pattern of scores on four dimensions, including anxiety and depression. Study subjects were interviewed first respondents from the general population in a cross-sectional household survey. Then, according their ratings on PSYDIS, subsamples were selected for psychiatric evaluation in a clinic a few weeks later. The survey ratings of 287 persons were compared with evaluations of the same persons experienced psychiatrists. Overall levels of concordance ranged from 76% to 80%, depending the psychiatric criterion used. Concordance was very high for women; it was lower for men for persons classified as High on PSYDIS We then applied two analytic strategies for increasing agreement between the clinical judgements and the clinical ratings. Strategy number I augmented the symptom checklist data with additional survey data on the subject's history of episodes of distress. Strategy II revised procedures for constructing the PSYDIS typology by (1) using more rigorous cutting point scores on the component scales, and (2) using a non-typological method of classification. The first strategy improved agreement between the clinic and survey measures; the second did not. The paper also compares PSYDIS with other brief symptom checklist measures.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":34},"references":37,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
