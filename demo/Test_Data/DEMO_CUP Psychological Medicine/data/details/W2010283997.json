A highly significant increase in the number of cases over time was found. The average annual incidence rate for the period 1978–82 was 4·06 per 100000 population. The case notes of every second patient on the register were inspected to assess diagnostic reliability, to define patient characteristics further and to look for changes in these over time. The diagnosis was highly suspect in 5% of cases. A social class bias was found, with an over-representation of classes I and II but an under-representation of social class III. Few significant changes were noted in the patients over time. The utilization of services was also examined, and it was found that 24% of the patients remained in contact for 4 years or more.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":140},"references":13,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
