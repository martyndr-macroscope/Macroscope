Methods In our case/non-case pharmacovigilance study, based on VigiBase ® , the WHO database of suspected adverse drug reactions, we estimated reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the Bayesian information component (IC) with 95% confidence/credibility intervals (CI) as measures of disproportionate reporting of antidepressant-related neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Antidepressants were first compared to all other medications, then to methadone, and finally within each class of antidepressants: SSRIs, tricyclics (TCA) and other antidepressants. Antidepressants were ranked in terms of clinical priority, based on semiquantitative score ratings. Serious v. non-serious reports were compared. Results A total of 406 reports of neonatal withdrawal syndrome in 379 neonates related to 15 antidepressants were included. Disproportionate reporting was detected for antidepressants as a group as compared to all other drugs (ROR: 6.18, 95% CI 5.45–7.01, IC: 2.07, 95% CI 1.92–2.21). Signals were found for TCAs (10.55, 95% CI 8.02–13.88), followed by other antidepressants (ROR: 5.90, 95% CI 4.74–7.36) and SSRIs (ROR: 4.68, 95% CI 4.04–5.42). Significant disproportionality emerged for all individual antidepressants except for bupropion, whereas no disproportionality for any antidepressant was detected v. methadone. Eleven antidepressants had a moderate clinical priority score and four had a weak one. Most frequent symptoms included respiratory symptoms ( n = 106), irritability/agitation ( n = 75), tremor ( n = 52) and feeding problems ( n = 40). Conclusions Most antidepressants are associated with moderate signals of disproportionate reporting for neonatal withdrawal syndrome, which should be considered when prescribing an antidepressant during pregnancy, irrespective of class.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":15},"references":56,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
