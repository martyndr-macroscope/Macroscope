It remains unclear if cognitive deficits progress over time or remain stable. Determining patients at increased risk of progressive worsening might help targeted neurocognitive remediation approaches. Methods This 20-year follow-up study examined neurocognitive outcomes of 156 participants from the OPUS I trial. Neurocognition was assessed using the brief assessment of cognition in schizophrenia at the 10- and 20-year follow-up, allowing us to examine changes in neurocognition over ten years. Results We found that 30.5% of patients had a declining course of neurocognition, 49.2% had a stable course of neurocognition and 20.3% experienced improvements in neurocognition. Good cognitive functioning at the 20-year follow-up was significantly associated with higher levels of social functioning (B 6.86, CI 4.71–9.02, p &lt; 0.001) while increasing experiential negative symptoms were significantly correlated to cognitive worsening (PC-0.231, p = 0.029). Younger age at inclusion (B: 0.23 per 10-years, CI 0.00–0.045, p = 0.047) and low level of education (below ten years) (mean difference: −0.346, CI −0.616 to −0.076, p = 0.012) predicted declining neurocognition. Conclusion Our findings support the notion of different schizophrenia subtypes with varying trajectories. Neurocognitive impairment at the 20-year follow-up was associated with other poor outcomes, highlighting the importance of treatments aimed at improving neurocognition in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":10},"references":67,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
