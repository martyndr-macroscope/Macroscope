Seven of the eight childhood adversities considered are significantly associated with recent (12-month) episodes of depression. These effects are largely indirect consequences of some childhood adversities leading to a life history of depression and prior depression leading to new episodes. Only three of the eight childhood adversities directly affect recent onset or recurrence. The paper closes with a discussion of implications for future research on the long-term effects of childhood adversities.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":17,"cited_by_count":383},"references":92,"networkCitations":17,"seed":false}
