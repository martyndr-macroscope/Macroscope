However, studies examining the relationships between structure and function yielded heterogeneous and inconclusive results. Recent work has suggested that the structure-function relationship is not uniform throughout the brain but varies across different levels of functional hierarchy. This study aims to investigate changes in structure-function couplings (SFC) and their relevance to antidepressant response in MDD from a functional hierarchical perspective. Methods We compared regional SFC between individuals with MDD ( n = 258) and healthy controls (HC, n = 99) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We also compared antidepressant non-responders ( n = 55) and responders ( n = 68, defined by a reduction in depressive severity of &gt;50%). To evaluate variations in altered and response-associated SFC across the functional hierarchy, we ranked significantly different regions by their principal gradient values and assessed patterns of increase or decrease along the gradient axis. The principal gradient value, calculated from 219 healthy individuals in the Human Connectome Project, represents a region's position along the principal gradient axis. Results Compared to HC, MDD patients exhibited increased SFC in unimodal regions (lower principal gradient) and decreased SFC in transmodal regions (higher principal gradient) ( p &lt; 0.001). Responders primarily had higher SFC in unimodal regions and lower SFC in attentional networks (median principal gradient) ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Our findings reveal opposing SFC alterations in low-level unimodal and high-level transmodal networks, underscoring spatial variability in MDD pathology. Moreover, hierarchy-specific antidepressant effects provide valuable insights into predicting treatment outcomes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":56,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
