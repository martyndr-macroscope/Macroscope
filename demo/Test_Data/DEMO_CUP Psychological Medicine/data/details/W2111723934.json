However, the ‘schizoid’ boys stole less often and had fewer alcohol problems. In this group antisocial conduct was less related to family disruption and social disadvantage, and more to an unusual fantasy life. Clinical descriptions of a series of ‘schizoid’ boys and girls with conspicuous antisocial conduct follow. They suggest that characteristic patterns of antisocial conduct in such children are persistent expressions of hostility and, especially in girls, pathological lying, for which environmental circumstances provide no explanation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":32},"references":32,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
