Because generalized self-efficacy failed to correlate to increased test performance, future research needs to disentangle the effective components of goal-setting instructions. Task-specific self-efficacy as well as enhancement of task-focused attention might underlie the significant goal-setting effect in depressed patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":73},"references":0,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
