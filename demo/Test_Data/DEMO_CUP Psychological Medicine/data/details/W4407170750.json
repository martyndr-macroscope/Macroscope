In this study, we aimed to identify EEG-derived rsFBN-based biomarkers to predict pharmacotherapeutic responsiveness. Methods The resting-state EEG signals were acquired for demography-matched three groups: 98 patients with treatment-refractory MDD (trMDD), 269 those with good-responding MDD (grMDD), and 131 healthy controls (HCs). The source-level rsFBN was constructed using 31 sources as nodes and beta-band power envelope correlation (PEC) as edges. The degree centrality (DC) and clustering coefficients (CCs) were calculated for various sparsity levels. Network-based statistic and one-way analysis of variance models were employed for comparing PECs and network indices, respectively. The multiple comparisons were controlled by the false discovery rate. Results Patients with trMDD were characterized by the altered dorsal attention network and salience network. Specifically, they exhibited hypoconnection between eye fields and right parietal regions ( p = 0.0088), decreased DC in the right supramarginal gyrus ( q = 0.0057), and decreased CC in the reward circuit ( q s &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, both MDD groups shared increased DC but decreased CC in the posterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions We confirmed that network topology was more severely deteriorated in patients with trMDD, particularly for the attention-regulatory networks. Our findings suggested that the altered rsFBN topologies could serve as potential pathologically interpretable biomarkers for predicting antidepressant responsiveness.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":46,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
