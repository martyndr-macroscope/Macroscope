Methods This prospective, observational study assessed depression symptoms, social support, marital status, household responsibility, functional impairment, mortality and need for further coronary procedures over 14 years of follow-up. Data were collected in-hospital post-CABG and at home 1-year later. Mortality and subsequent cardiac procedure data were extracted from a Cardiac Registry. Results Of 296 baseline participants, 78% (43% were women) completed data at 1-year post-CABG. Long-term survival was shorter with 1-year depression and lower household responsibility but that was not true for the measures taken at baseline [HR for depression = 1.27; 95% CI 1.02–1.59 v. 0.99 (0.78–1.25), and HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.52–0.97 v. 0.97 (0.80–1.16)] for household responsibility. An interaction between depression symptoms and social support at year 1 [χ 2 (11) = 111.05, p &lt; 0.001] revealed a greater hazard of mortality d with increased depression only at mean (HR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.21–2.26) and high social support (HR = 2.23; 95% CI 1.46–3.40). Depression also accounted for increased event recurrence. There were no significant interactions of sex with medical long-term outcomes. Conclusions In a sex-balanced sample, depression and household responsibility measured at 1-year post-CABG were associated with significant variance in unadjusted and adjusted predictor models of long-term mortality whereas the same indices determined right after the procedure were not significant predictors.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":43,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
