All instruments were found to have good internal reliability indices. Retest reliability of the GHQ, not tested for in the other instruments, was modest. Criterion validity, using a semi-structured interview on the basis of the Munich Diagnostic Checklist for DSM-III-R as external criterion, was good for the Goldberg scales, but modest for the two other instruments.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":27},"references":17,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
