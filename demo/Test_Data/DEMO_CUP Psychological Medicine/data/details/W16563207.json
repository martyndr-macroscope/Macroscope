These in turn have been linked to symptom maintenance and recurrence. Clinical interventions that foster appraisals of recovery rather than of chronicity and severity may therefore improve emotional well-being in people with psychosis. It might be better to address adherence to medication through direct attempts at helping them understand their need for treatment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":109},"references":0,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
