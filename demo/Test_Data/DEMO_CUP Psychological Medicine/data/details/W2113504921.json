About 27% of the students reported 6 or more symptoms of psychological distress on the GHQ-30. The frequency of symptoms varied with age, grade level and average marks, with sex being the most significant variation. ‘Anxiety’ and ‘social dysfunction’ were the most frequent symptom dimensions reported. More detailed analysis of possible predictors of mental health showed that the nature and quality of family life strongly affected adolescent mental health. Adolescents' positive evaluation of their school atmosphere and peer group life and their locus of control orientation also positively influenced their psychological well-being.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":85},"references":49,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
