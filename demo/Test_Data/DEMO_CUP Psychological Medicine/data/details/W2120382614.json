The classical schizophrenic subtypes exhibited a significant tendency towards homotypia among their secondary cases. The genetic evidence did not support the monopolar–bipolar subdivision of affective disorder. Schizo-affective disorders impinged on the clear-cut schizophrenic and affective psychotic disorders and there was no homotypical tendency among the relatives of index cases with this diagnosis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":12},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
