This trial aimed to simultaneously examine the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and light dark therapy (LDT), targeting different mechanisms, against treatment-as-usual (TAU), in reducing maternal postpartum insomnia symptoms. Methods This three-arm randomised controlled trial recruited from the general community in Australia. Nulliparous females 4–12 months postpartum with self-reported insomnia symptoms [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores &gt;7] were included; severe medical/psychiatric conditions were excluded. Participants were randomised 1:1:1 to CBT, LDT, or TAU stratified by ISI (&lt; or ⩾14) and infant age (&lt; or ⩾8 months). Participants and principal investigators were unblinded. Six-week interventions were delivered via digital materials and telephone. The primary outcome was insomnia symptoms (ISI), assessed pre-, midpoint-, post- (primary endpoint), and one-month post-intervention. Analyses were intention-to-treat using latent growth models. Results 114 participants (CBT = 39, LDT = 36, TAU = 39; M age = 32.20 ± 4.62 years) were randomised. There were significantly greater reductions in ISI scores in CBT and LDT (effect sizes −2.01 and −1.52 respectively, p &lt; 0.001) from baseline to post-intervention compared to TAU; improvements were maintained at follow-up. Similar effects were observed for self-reported sleep disturbance. There were greater reductions in fatigue in CBT (effect size = 0.85, p &lt; 0.001) but not LDT ( p = 0.11) compared to TAU. Changes in sleepiness, depression, and anxiety were non-significant compared to TAU (all p &gt; 0.08). Four participants (11%) in the LDT group reported headaches, dizziness, or nausea; no others reported adverse events. Conclusions Therapist-assisted CBT and LDT were feasible during the first postpartum year; data at post-intervention and 1-month follow-up support their safety and efficacy in reducing postpartum insomnia symptoms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":19},"references":44,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
