This study tested efficacy of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) maintenance treatment amongst acute responders. Methods This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-site trial, conducted March 2019 to September 2023, tested LDX as maintenance treatment for responders to acute treatments with LDX-alone or with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT + LDX) for BED with obesity. Sixty-one (83.6% women, mean age 44.3, mean BMI 36.1 kg/m 2 ) acute responders were randomized to LDX ( N = 32) or placebo ( N = 29) for 12 weeks; 95.1% completed posttreatment assessments. Mixed-models and generalized-estimating equations comparing maintenance LDX v. placebo included main/interactive effects of acute (LDX or CBT + LDX) treatments to examine their predictive/moderating effects. Results Relapse rates (to diagnosis-level binge-eating frequency) following maintenance treatments were 10.0% ( N = 3/30) for LDX and 17.9% ( N = 5/28) for placebo; intention-to-treat binge-eating remission rates were 59.4% ( N = 19/32) and 65.5% ( N = 19/29), respectively. Maintenance LDX and placebo did not differ significantly in binge-eating but differed in weight-loss and eating-disorder psychopathology. Maintenance LDX was associated with significant weight-loss (−2.3%) whereas placebo had significant weight-gain (+2.2%); LDX and placebo differed significantly in weight-change throughout treatment and at posttreatment. Eating-disorder psychopathology remained unchanged with LDX but increased significantly with placebo. Acute treatments did not significantly predict/moderate maintenance-treatment outcomes. Conclusions Adults with BED/obesity who respond to acute lisdexamfetamine treatment (regardless of additionally receiving CBT) had good maintenance during subsequent 12-weeks. Maintenance lisdexamfetamine, relative to placebo, did not provide further benefit for binge-eating but was associated with significantly better eating-disorder psychopathology outcomes and greater weight-loss.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":6},"references":28,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
