The study included both ethnographic observation and a sample survey ( N = 733) using a modified Clinical Interview Schedule. The findings lend support to the hypothesis that although a female excess of MPM will be found among the patrilineal group (the Bunun ), the reverse will be observed in the matrilineal group (the Ami ); no such difference will be found in the bilateral group (the Atayal ). Further analysis revealed sex differences in the mean duration of MPM and similar incidence ratios between two sexes in these three groups. Possible sociocultural explanations are proposed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":10},"references":23,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
