Of these, 57 subjects (15·2%) were identified as ‘cases’. Ten per cent of the sample was affected by a depressive syndrome and 4% by an anxiety disorder. Females were significantly more at risk for anxiety disorders, while a trend towards a major risk for depression emerged among middle-aged and elderly people. Of the sample 9·8% were taking benzodiazepines, with a significant over representation of females. Depressed subjects took benzodiazepines more frequently than anxious subjects, while the use of antidepressants was negligible.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":38},"references":52,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
