To understand its possible causation, the mechanisms controlling micturition are described together with the possible sites of action of various anti-enuretic agents, particularly imipramine. It is concluded that further research into the central control of micturition is required before the precise actions of centrally-acting anti-enuretic agents can be elucidated. Knowledge of these may give insight into the nature of the defect causing enuresis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":19},"references":85,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
