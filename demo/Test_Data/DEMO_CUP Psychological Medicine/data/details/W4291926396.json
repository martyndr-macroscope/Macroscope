However, it remains unclear whether cognitive performances differ between individuals at high and low genetic risks for SCZ or BD. Methods Using the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) data, we calculated PGC3 SCZ-, PGC3 BD-, and SCZ v. BD polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in 173 SCZ patients, 70 unaffected first-degree relatives (FRs) and 196 healthy controls (HCs). Based on combinations of three PRS deciles, individuals in the genetic SCZ, genetic BD and low genetic risk groups were extracted. Cognitive performance was assessed by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. Results SCZ-, BD-, SCZ v. BD-PRSs were associated with case–control status ( R 2 = 0.020–0.061), and SCZ-PRS was associated with relative–control status ( R 2 = 0.023). Furthermore, individuals in the highest decile for SCZ PRSs had elevated BD-PRSs [odds ratio (OR) = 6.33] and SCZ v. BD-PRSs (OR = 1.86) compared with those in the lowest decile. Of the three genetic risk groups, the low genetic risk group contained more HCs, whereas the genetic BD and SCZ groups contained more SCZ patients ( p &lt; 0.05). SCZ patients had widespread cognitive impairments, and FRs had cognitive impairments that were between those of SCZ patients and HCs ( p &lt; 0.05). Cognitive differences between HCs in the low genetic risk group and SCZ patients in the genetic BD or genetic SCZ groups were more prominent (Cohen's d &gt; −0.20) than those between HCs and SCZ patients in the no genetic risk group. Furthermore, SCZ patients in the genetic SCZ group displayed lower scores in verbal fluency and attention than those in the genetic BD group ( d &gt; −0.20). Conclusions Our findings suggest that cognitive impairments in SCZ are partially mediated through genetic loadings for SCZ but not BD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":20},"references":59,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
