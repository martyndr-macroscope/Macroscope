Subjects were asked to imagine: seeing, smelling, or tasting something disgusting; and having something wonderful happen to them. Subjects were asked to show the experimenter what their face would look like if these things happened. The groups differed in how frequently they exhibited anger or contempt in the first condition and happiness in the second condition. The depressives were most likely to exhibit anger/contempt and least likely to exhibit happiness. Using Beck Depression Inventory scores as dependent variables, there were significant interactions between diagnostic group and the type of facial expressions exhibited. The associations between facial expressions and BDI scores were in the opposite directions for depressives and schizophrenics.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":45},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
