However, patients’ metabolic profiles were influenced by time-invariant and time-varying confounders. Real-world evidence on the long-term, dynamic effects of SGAs (e.g. different treatment sequences) are limited. We employed advanced causal inference methods to evaluate the metabolic impact of SGAs in a naturalistic cohort. Methods We followed 696 Chinese patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders receiving SGAs. Longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (LTMLE) was used to estimate the average treatment effects (ATEs) of continuous SGA treatment versus ‘no treatment’ on metabolic outcomes, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG), fasting glucose (FG), and body mass index (BMI), over 6–18 months at 3-month intervals. LTMLE accounted for time-invariant and time-varying confounders. Post-SGA discontinuation side effects were also assessed. Results The ATEs of continuous SGA treatment on BMI and TG showed an inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking at 12 months and declining afterwards. Similar patterns were observed for TC and LDL, albeit the ATEs peaked at 15 months. For FG and HDL, the ATEs peaked at ~6 months. The adverse impact of SGAs on BMI persisted even after medication discontinuation, yet other metabolic parameters did not show such lingering side effects. Clozapine and olanzapine exhibited greater metabolic side effects compared to other SGAs. Conclusions Our real-world study suggests that metabolic side effects may stabilize with prolonged continuous treatment. Clozapine and olanzapine confer higher cardiometabolic risks than other SGAs. The side effects of SGAs on BMI may persist after drug discontinuation. These insights may guide antipsychotic choice and improve management of metabolic side effects.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":35,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
