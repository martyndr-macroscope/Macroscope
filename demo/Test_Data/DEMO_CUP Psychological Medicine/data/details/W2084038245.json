Executive function deficits have been reported repeatedly in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Stimulant medication has been shown to be effective in improving cognitive performance on most executive function tasks, but neuropsychological tests of executive function in this population have yielded inconsistent results. Methodological limitations may explain these inconsistencies. This study aimed to measure executive function in medicated and non-medicated children with ADHD by using a computerized battery, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), which is sensitive to executive function deficits in older patients with frontostriatal neurological impairments. Methods. Executive function was assessed in 30 children with ADHD: 15 were stimulant medication naïve and 15 were treated with stimulant medication. These two groups were compared to 15 age, sex and IQ matched controls. Results. The unmedicated children with ADHD displayed specific cognitive impairments on executive function tasks of spatial short-term memory, spatial working memory, set-shifting ability and planning ability. Impairments were also seen on spatial recognition memory and delayed matching to sample, while pattern recognition memory remained intact. The medicated children with ADHD were not impaired on any of the above executive function tasks except for deficits in spatial recognition memory. Conclusions. ADHD is associated with deficits in executive function. Stimulant medication is associated with better executive function performance. Prospective follow-up studies are required to examine these effects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":338},"references":37,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
