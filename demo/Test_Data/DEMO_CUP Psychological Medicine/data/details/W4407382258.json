Investigating the interplay between explicit narrative and implicit emotional memory contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying PTSD. Methods This case–control study focused on two groups: unmedicated patients with PTSD and a trauma-exposed control (TEC) group who did not develop PTSD. Experiments included real-time measurements of blood oxygenation changes using functional near-infrared spectroscopy during trauma narration and processing of emotional and linguistic data through natural language processing (NLP). Results Real-time fNIRS monitoring showed that PTSD patients (mean [SD] Oxy-Hb activation, 0.153 [0.084], 95% CI 0.124 to 0.182) had significantly higher brain activity in the left anterior medial prefrontal cortex (L-amPFC) within 10 s after expressing negative emotional words compared with the control group (0.047 [0.026], 95% CI 0.038 to 0.056; p &lt; 0.001). In the control group, there was a significant time-series correlation between the use of negative emotional memory words and activation of the L-amPFC (latency 3.82 s, slope = 0.0067, peak value = 0.184, difference = 0.273; Spearman’s r = 0.727, p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the left anterior cingulate prefrontal cortex of PTSD patients remained in a state of high activation (peak value = 0.153, difference = 0.084) with no apparent latency period. Conclusions PTSD patients display overactivity in pathways associated with rapid emotional responses and diminished regulation in cognitive processing areas. Interventions targeting these pathways may alleviate symptoms of PTSD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":54,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
