A test of these hypotheses was undertaken by comparing a group of ‘alcoholic’ hallucinators with a group of ‘alcoholic’ non-hallucinators. Some support is claimed for the ‘ boundary confusion ’ hypothesis but not for the ‘ lack of familiarity ’ hypothesis. Specifically, it was found that hallucinators performed significantly worse than non-hallucinators on the Embedded Figures Test (a measure of perceptual boundary confusion) and on the Intersensory Time Judgement Test (a measure of conceptual boundary confusion). These results are discussed in relation to other aspects of the predisposition to hallucinate. Some specific research needs are described.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":25,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
