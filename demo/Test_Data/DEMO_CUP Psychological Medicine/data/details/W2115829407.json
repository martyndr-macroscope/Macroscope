Despite being free of episodes of bingeeating and vomiting for a prolonged period, the abstinent BN subjects still appeared to practice dietary restraint as judged by their food intake in a test meal. In addition, their plasma TRP concentrations were significantly lower than those of the controls. Administration of a TRP-free amino acid load (52 g) significantly lowered plasma total and free TRP. However, compared to a balanced amino acid load, this procedure did not have significant effects on mood, appetite or food intake in either the abstinent BN subjects or the healthy controls.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":34},"references":29,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
