From this analysis two dimensions of illness emerged, corresponding to anxiety and depression. In the present paper, this symptom-based representation of minor psychiatric illness is used as a framework for comparing four diagnostic systems: General Practitioner (GP) diagnoses, the ID-CATEGO diagnostic system, the DSM-III system and the Bedford College diagnostic system. This analysis clarifies the reasons for disagreement among systems of diagnostic criteria and examines the practical effects of alternative diagnostic algorithms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":25},"references":9,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
