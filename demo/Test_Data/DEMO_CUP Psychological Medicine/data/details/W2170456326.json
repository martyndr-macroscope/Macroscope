The patient was clinically and biochemically euthyroid at the time the psychosis developed. It is suggested that an acute alteration in thyroid status, without necessarily producing hyper- or hypothyroidism, may be sufficient to induce a psychotic reaction.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":21},"references":10,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
