Serum choline levels were increased threefold and CSF choline levels by 72%. CSF choline levels in the untreated Alzheimer patients did not differ significantly from age-matched controls. In 35 neurological controls, CSF choline levels increased with age (γ = 0·64, P &lt;0·001). Choline influx into erythrocytes from 10 male and female Alzheimer patients did not differ significantly from 40 male and 43 female controls. Choline influx into erythrocytes was not related to age or sex, although the range was greater ( P &lt;0·05) in females than in males. Our results indicate that there is no impairment of choline transport into CSF or erythrocytes in patients with pre-senile Alzheimer's disease.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":23},"references":42,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
