Although these neurons are few in number, they send projections widely throughout the central nervous system (Kilduff &amp; Peyron, 2000). There has been great excitement about the orexins/hypocretins from both the scientific and medical community. These peptides are remarkable in that they were discovered using state-of-the-art molecular techniques before their physiological actions were studied. Furthermore, there has been an exponential progress in our scientific knowledge of these peptides culminating in the orexins/hypocretins being linked to the sleep disorder, narcolepsy. With the importance of the orexins/hypocretins in sleep and arousal being increasingly recognized, it is likely that these peptides are altered by or contribute to several medical and psychiatric disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":15},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
