However, no studies to date have examined RPE-associated brain activations in relation to this symptom. Methods Seventy-eight patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and 43 healthy individuals underwent fMRI while they performed a probabilistic monetary reward task designed to generate a measure of RPE. Ratings of delusions and referentiality were made in the patients. Results Using whole-brain, voxel-based analysis, schizophrenia patients showed only minor differences in RPE-associated activation compared to healthy controls. Within the patient group, however, severity of delusions was inversely associated with RPE-associated activation in areas including the caudate nucleus, the thalamus and the left pallidum, as well as the lateral frontal cortex bilaterally, the pre- and postcentral gyrus and supplementary motor area, the middle cingulate gyrus, and parts of the temporal and parietal cortex. A broadly similar pattern of association was seen for referentiality. Conclusions According to this study, while patients with schizophrenia as a group do not show marked alterations in RPE signaling, delusions and referentiality are associated with reduced activation in parts of the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia, though not specifically the ventral striatum. The direction of the changes is on the face of it contrary to that predicted by aberrant salience theory.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":46,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
