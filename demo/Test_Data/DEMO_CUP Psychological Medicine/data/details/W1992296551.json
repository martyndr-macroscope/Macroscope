The factors varied in this design were medication (testosterone or placebo), treatment frequency (weekly or monthly sessions), and the number of therapists involved (one female or a male/female pair). All counselling was adapted from that described by Masters &amp; Johnson (1970) and Heiman et al. (1976). Results were assessed before and after a 3-month treatment period, and again 6 months later. Contary to expectations from earlier work, there was no benefit attributable to testosterone or to the use two therapits; selfrating favoured weekly sessions with one therapist.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":53},"references":12,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
