The study examines staff attitudes towards management practices, towards the potential achievement of individuals with learning difficulties, the staff's perceived involvement in decision making, and also the nature of their interaction with the clients, in two different settings on the Unit. The Unit's management practices were found to be client-orientated in nature and staff were more in agreement with client-orientated than institution-orientated management practices. Staff were generally optimistic about clients' potential and felt involved in decision making. Correlations between certain staff characteristics, attitudes and interactions are discussed. The study extends the range of services that have been evaluated in this way, and provides a description of the service in its early stages, which will provide an important comparison point for it when it is more permanently established.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":17,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
