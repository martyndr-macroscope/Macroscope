Moreover, patients have been observed to present a significant elevation of dopamine receptor availability compared to healthy controls. Although it is difficult to measure dopamine levels directly in humans, neurochemical imaging techniques such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide indirect indices of in vivo dopamine synthesis and release, and putative synaptic levels. Methods We focused on the role of dopamine postsynaptic regulation using [ 123 I] iodobenzamide (IBZM) SPECT. We compared D 2/3 receptor availability between 53 healthy controls and 21 medication-naive patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. Result The mean specific striatal binding showed no significant difference between patients and controls (estimated difference = 0.001; 95% CI −0.11 to 0.11; F = 0.00, df = 1, 69; p = 0.99). There was a highly significant effect of age whereby IBZM binding declined with advancing age [estimated change per decade of age = −0.01(binding ratio); 95% CI −0.01 to −0.004; F = 11.5, df = 1, 69; p = 0.001]. No significant correlations were found between the mean specific striatal binding and psychopathological or cognitive rating scores. Conclusions Medication-naïve patients with recent-onset schizophrenia have similar D 2/3 receptor availability to healthy controls. We suggest that, rather than focusing exclusively on postsynaptic receptors, future treatments should target the presynaptic control of dopamine synthesis and release.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":93,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
