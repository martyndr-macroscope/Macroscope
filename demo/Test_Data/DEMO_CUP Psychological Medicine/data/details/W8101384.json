The results are compared with previous findings. TD was significantly associated with parkinsonian symptoms and with the number of years in contact with the psychiatric services. There was a trend, in affective disorder only, towards an association with current neuroleptic dose. The patients with affective disorder also had higher rates of TD than patients with schizophrenia and paranoid psychosis. History of treatment with ECT correlated negatively with TD among those with schizophrenia, and positively among those with affective disorder. As in other studies, duration of neuroleptic treatment did not correlate with the presence or absence of TD. In contrast to some previous reports, age and cognitive status were not related to TD status. Possible reasons for this are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":12},"references":0,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
