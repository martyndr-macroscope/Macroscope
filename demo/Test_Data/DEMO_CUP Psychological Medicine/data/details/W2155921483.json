The results suggest that, when on treatment with lithium, manic depressive patients with a good prognosis tend to have a higher erythrocyte Na-K ATPase and higher plasma and erythrocyte lithium concentrations than those with a poor prognosis. There was no evidence to suggest that the erythrocyte: plasma lithium ratio was useful in predicting clinical response to lithium therapy. There was also a positive correlation between plasma lithium concentration and Na–K ATPase activity, confirming that in manic depressive subjects lithium produces a rise in erythrocyte Na–K ATPase activity.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":35},"references":17,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
