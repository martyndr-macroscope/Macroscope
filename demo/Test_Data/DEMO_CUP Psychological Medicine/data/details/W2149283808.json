It is suggested that these results provide some support for the idea that obsessive compulsive disorder may be misclassified as an anxiety disorder and may in fact be categorically more closely aligned to the schizophrenic constellation of disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":99},"references":40,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
