Comparisons have been made between different diagnostic groups on the basis of the 12 scales from the In-patient Multidimensional Psychiatric Scale (IMPS) using data from a sample of 787 newly admitted in-patients. For each diagnostic group, a figure was produced containing the Andrews' curves from all the patients in the group. Those groups that were particularly homogeneous or heterogeneous were noted. The main features of the different groups could be discerned.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":6,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
