Twenty-nine of them had a primary anorexia nervosa (most of them also had bulimic symptoms). They were compared with a series of 23 female anorexia nervosa patients. The males scored more highly than female patients on a number of symptoms, but generally more similarities than differences in symptomatology were apparent. Male patients with primary anorexia nervosa also showed several signs of a disturbed psychosexual and gender identity development. The data support the hypothesis that males with atypical gender role behaviour have an increased risk for developing anorexia nervosa or bulimia in adolescence.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":82},"references":63,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
