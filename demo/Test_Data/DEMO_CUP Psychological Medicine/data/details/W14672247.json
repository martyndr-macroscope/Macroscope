The blunted ghrelin response to food ingestion may support the occurrence in bulimic subjects of an impaired suppression of the drive to eat following a meal. This may have implications for binge-eating.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":1,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
