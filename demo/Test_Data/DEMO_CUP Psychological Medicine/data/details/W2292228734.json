This longitudinal, community-based study examined associations of DMDD at the age of 6 years with psychiatric disorders, functional impairment, peer functioning and service use at the age of 9 years. Method A total of 473 children were assessed at the ages of 6 and 9 years. Child psychopathology and functional impairment were assessed at the age of 6 years with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment with parents and at the age of 9 years with the Kiddie-Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) with parents and children. At the age of 9 years, mothers, fathers and youth completed the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, and teachers and K-SADS interviewers completed measures of peer functioning. Significant demographic covariates were included in all models. Results DMDD at the age of 6 years predicted a current diagnosis of DMDD at the age of 9 years. DMDD at the age of 6 years also predicted current and lifetime depressive disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at the age of 9 years, after controlling for all age 6 years psychiatric disorders. In addition, DMDD predicted depressive, ADHD and disruptive behavior disorder symptoms on the K-SADS, and maternal and paternal reports of depressive symptoms on the CDI, after controlling for the corresponding symptom scale at the age of 6 years. Last, DMDD at the age of 6 years predicted greater functional impairment, peer problems and educational support service use at the age of 9 years, after controlling for all psychiatric disorders at the age of 6 years. Conclusions Children with DMDD are at high risk for impaired functioning across childhood, and this risk is not accounted for by co-morbid conditions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":45},"references":31,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
