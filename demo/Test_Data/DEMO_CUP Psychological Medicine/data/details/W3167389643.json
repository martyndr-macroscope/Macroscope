We aim to compare the rates of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and controls. Method We established a lifetime diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, communication disorders, intellectual disabilities, specific learning disorders, and motor disorders] using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Present and Lifetime Version in 400 participants (mean age 11.3 + s.d. 3.9 years), including 93 offspring of parents with bipolar disorder, 182 offspring of parents with major depressive disorder, and 125 control offspring of parents with no mood disorder. Results Neurodevelopmental disorders were elevated in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder [odds ratio (OR) 2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–4.47, p = 0.010] and major depressive disorder (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.03–3.39, p = 0.035) compared to controls. This difference was driven by the rates of ADHD, which were highest among offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (30.1%), intermediate in offspring of parents with major depressive disorder (24.2%), and lowest in controls (14.4%). There were no significant differences in frequencies of other neurodevelopmental disorders between the three groups. Chronic course of mood disorder in parents was associated with higher rates of any neurodevelopmental disorder and higher rates of ADHD in offspring. Conclusions Our findings suggest monitoring for ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring of parents with MDDs may be indicated to improve early diagnosis and treatment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":16},"references":61,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
