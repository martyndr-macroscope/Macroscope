Our study’s contribution lies primarily in its novelty as currently the only head-to-head comparison of these treatment models, and its potential to generate exploratory findings for further testing in a definitive randomised controlled trial. We thank Luyten and colleagues for their useful commentary.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":7,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
