The major cognitive changes in depression are a decrease in the ability to maintain concentration and effort, and an increase in the relative salience of aversive events and memories, with a corresponding decrease in the salience of pleasant events. There is as yet little evidence to support the view that depressions arise out of pre-existing depressive attitudes. Attention is drawn to the heterogeneity of depressive disorders, and the significance of the endogenous/non-endogenous distinction is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":50},"references":220,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
