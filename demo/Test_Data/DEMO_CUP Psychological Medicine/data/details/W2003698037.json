Consistent with this finding, surgery could not be shown to have a beneficial effect on cognitive or motor functioning. Control data were supplied by 20 patients who underwent peripheral vascular surgery and 20 healthy subjects. The test-retest interval was 10 weeks.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":38},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
