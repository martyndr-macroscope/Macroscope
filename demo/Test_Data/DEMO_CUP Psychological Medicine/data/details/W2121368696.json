Scores on the self-rated GHQ showed no difference between the 2 groups. It is suggested that such differences could be avoided by giving careful attention to training interviewers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":39},"references":7,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
