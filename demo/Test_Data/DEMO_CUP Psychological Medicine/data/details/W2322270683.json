However, to date there has been no research into the association between these two vulnerability factors in persons with an increased genetic risk profile. We hypothesized that unaffected siblings of patients with non-affective psychosis have more movement disorders and schizotypy than healthy controls and that these co-occur. Method In a cross-sectional design we assessed the prevalence and inter-relationship of movement disorders and schizotypy in 115 unaffected siblings (mean age 27 years, 44% males) and 100 healthy controls (mean age 26 years, 51% males). Movement disorders were measured with the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and one separate item for dystonia. Schizotypy was assessed with the Structured Interview for Schizotypy – Revised (SIS-R). Results There were significant differences in the prevalence of movement disorders in unaffected siblings versus healthy controls (10% v . 1%, p &lt;0.01) but not in the prevalence of schizotypy. Unaffected siblings with a movement disorder displayed significantly more positive and total schizotypy ( p =0.02 and 0.03 respectively) than those without. In addition, dyskinesia correlated with positive schizotypy ( r =0.51, p =0.02). Conclusions The association between movement disorders (dyskinesia in particular) with positive and total schizotypy in unaffected siblings suggests that certain vulnerability factors for psychosis or schizophrenia cluster in a subgroup of subjects with an increased genetic risk of developing the disease.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":17},"references":46,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
