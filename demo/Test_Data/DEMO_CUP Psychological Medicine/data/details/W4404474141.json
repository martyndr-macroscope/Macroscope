We explored whether polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for several mental disorders predicted poorer clinical and psychological COVID-19 outcomes in people with pre-existing depression. Methods Data from three assessments of the Australian Genetics of Depression Study ( N = 4405; 52.2 years ± 14.9; 76.2% females) were analyzed. Outcomes included COVID-19 clinical outcomes (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection and long COVID, noting the low incidence of COVID-19 cases in Australia at that time) and COVID-19 psychological outcomes (COVID-related stress and COVID-19 burnout). Predictors included PRS for depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety. The associations between these PRSs and the outcomes were assessed with adjusted linear/logistic/multinomial regressions. Mediation ( N = 4338) and moderation ( N = 3326) analyses were performed to explore the potential influence of anxiety symptoms and resilience on the identified associations between the PRSs and COVID-19 psychological outcomes. Results None of the selected PRS predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection or long COVID. In contrast, the depression PRS predicted higher levels of COVID-19 burnout. Anxiety symptoms fully mediated the association between the depression PRS and COVID-19 burnout. Resilience did not moderate this association. Conclusions A higher genetic risk for depression predicted higher COVID-19 burnout and this association was fully mediated by anxiety symptoms. Interventions targeting anxiety symptoms may be effective in mitigating the psychological effects of a pandemic among people with depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":50,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
