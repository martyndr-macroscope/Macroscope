Pre-treatment plasma melatonin concentrations were normal. After one day of DMI treatment plasma melatonin concentrations were increased but the response was impaired compared to normal subjects. The acute effect of DMI on plasma melatonin persisted after six weeks of treatment. These findings question the hypothesis that beta adrenoceptors are supersensitive in depression and that antidepressant drugs act by down-regulating these receptors.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":32},"references":58,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
