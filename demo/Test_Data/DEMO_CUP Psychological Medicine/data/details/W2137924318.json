These ‘diaries’ were obtained on three occasions from 54 families with two pre-school children. Effects of age, birth order, sex, and social class were found which support the findings of other studies: an inverted U-shaped relationship existed between the intensity of attention received and the child's intelligence and developmental quotients. A relatively high correlation between IQ and an affective measure of child care furnished further evidence that the differences in caretaking relevant to intellectual development are qualitative rather than quantitative ones.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":23},"references":42,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
