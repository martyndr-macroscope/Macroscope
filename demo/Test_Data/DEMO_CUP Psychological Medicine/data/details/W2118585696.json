It has been claimed that depressive disorders have increased during the sixties and seventies. In order to examine this hypothesis on a normal population (the Lundby Study), comparisons were made of the incidence figures for depression during the periods 1947–57 and 1957–72, and during the five 5-year intervals within the period.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":296},"references":20,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
