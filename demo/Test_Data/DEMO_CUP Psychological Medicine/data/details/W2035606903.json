Examination of the influence of psychological, demographic, physical and biochemical factors revealed the Beck Depression Inventory and age as the two most important predictors of survival. The behaviour of the patient was directly responsible for five (11·6%) of the deaths, by suicide in three cases and dietary noncompliance in two cases. Hypothetical mechanisms linking depression with reduced survival have been reviewed. As the impact of depression on survival was maximal in the first few years of dialysis, monitoring for depression should be incorporated into routine care from the start of dialysis together with evaluative interventions that might enhance survival.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":77},"references":44,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
