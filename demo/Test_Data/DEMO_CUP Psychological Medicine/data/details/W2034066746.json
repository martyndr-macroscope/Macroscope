The psychological features were associated with 24 of the 27 symptoms, and the extent to 1which these measurements determined the presence of a symptom was calculated. DEP and FFA were correlated with most of the symptoms, PHO with weak limbs, blurred vision, slow walking pace, nocturia and a lessened interest in sex. HYS was positively associated with the frequency of sexual intercourse in men and negatively with complaints of dyspnoea, tingling in the limbs and a slow walking pace. OBS was only associated with diarrhoea.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":17},"references":9,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
