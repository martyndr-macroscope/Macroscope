This was applied to cranial CT scans of 60 normal controls (36 aged &gt; 60 years), 25 elderly patients with major depression (14 of whom had the dementia syndrome of depression), and 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects received neuropsychological evaluation. Centrum semiovale (CSO) CT attenuation numbers decreased with increasing age for both white and grey matter. White matter attenuation values best discriminated elderly controls from the three patient groups. Both white and grey matter CSO attenuation values correlated with performance on a number of cognitive tasks.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":29},"references":48,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
