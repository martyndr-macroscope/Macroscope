Pitt (1968) was&#13;\\nthe first author to report high scores on neuroticism&#13;\\nand low scores on extraversion among postpartum&#13;\\ndepressed women. Similar results were found in a&#13;\\ncomparison of mothers with and without postpartum&#13;\\ndepressive symptoms (Dudley et al. 2001; Podolska&#13;\\net al. 2010). A case-control study comparing women&#13;\\nwith recurrent major depression with and without a&#13;\\nhistory of postpartum depression found no personality&#13;\\ntrait differences between them; however, those&#13;\\nwith a history of postpartum depression showed&#13;\\nhigher neuroticism and psychoticism and lower extraversion&#13;\\nthan controls. These results suggested that&#13;\\nthese traits did not confer a specific risk for the postnatal&#13;\\nonset episodes (Jones et al. 2010). Prospective&#13;\\nstudies have also studied the link between personality&#13;\\nand postpartum depression; however, these data are&#13;\\nnot conclusive due to methodological limitations, such&#13;\\nas sample size (Kumar &amp; Robson, 1984; Watson et al.&#13;\\n1984; Areias et al. 1991; Boyce et al. 1991; Matthey et al.&#13;\\n2000), selection bias (Kumar &amp; Robson, 1984; Areias&#13;\\net al. 1991; Boyce et al. 1991; Matthey et al. 2000), or&#13;\\ndepression assessment (self-report measures versus&#13;\\nclinical diagnosis: Boyce et al. 1991; Matthey et al.&#13;\\n2000; Dudley et al. 2001; Saisto et al. 2001; Van Bussel&#13;\\net al. 2009) or because the authors did not take into&#13;\\naccount confounding factors such as stressful life&#13;\\nevents or social support (Watson et al. 1984; Kumar &amp;&#13;\\nRobson, 1984; Boyce et al. 1991; Matthey et al. 2000;&#13;\\nSaisto et al. 2001; Verkerk et al. 2005; Van Bussel et al.&#13;\\n2009). (See Supplementary material, Table S1.)The aim of this paper was to extend the previous&#13;\\nknowledge of the role of neuroticism, extroversion&#13;\\nand psychoticism as risk factors for postpartum depression&#13;\\n(depression symptomatology and clinical diagnosis)&#13;\\nconsidering psychosocial variables in a large&#13;\\ncohort of women from the general population.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":48},"references":41,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
