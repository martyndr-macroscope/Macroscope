Chronic stress can lead to increased allostatic load (AL), a cumulative measure of multisystem dysregulation, and insulin resistance (IR), both of which are linked to mental health disorders. We hypothesized that heightened AL and IR during adolescence (age 17) would predict the emergence of mood and psychotic symptoms in young adults. Methods This study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a population cohort from Bristol, United Kingdom. Results Our results showed that elevated AL at age 17 was significantly associated with the development of mood disorder symptoms (MDS) and psychotic disorder symptoms (PDS) and the co-occurrence of mood and psychotic disorder symptoms (MPDS) at age 24 ( p &lt; 0.001). Mean AL increased progressively across these symptom groups, indicating a dose–response relationship between physiological dysregulation and mental health burden (MDS = 3.67, PDS = 3.89, and MPDS = 4.03). We also observed that IR was significantly elevated in the MDS, PDS, and MPDS groups compared to healthy controls (HCs). IR was most prevalent in the PDS group, suggesting a possible association between metabolic dysfunction and psychosis risk. Conclusion This study demonstrated that multisystem dysregulation in late adolescence precedes the onset of mood and psychotic symptoms in early adulthood. These results support the use of AL and metabolic markers as early indicators of psychiatric vulnerability and highlight the potential for early intervention targeting systemic dysregulation to prevent the onset of mental health disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":90,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
