However, ADHD is extremely underdiagnosed in adults and little is known about the medical comorbidities in undiagnosed adult individuals with high ADHD liability. In this study we investigated associations between ADHD genetic liability and electronic health record (EHR)-based ICD-10 diagnoses across all diagnostic categories, in individuals without ADHD diagnosis history. Methods We used data from the Estonian Biobank cohort ( N = 111 261) and generated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for ADHD (PRS ADHD ) based on the ADHD genome-wide association study. We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to test for associations between standardized PRS ADHD and 1515 EHR-based ICD-10 diagnoses in the full and sex-stratified sample. We compared the observed significant ICD-10 associations to associations with (1) ADHD diagnosis and (2) questionnaire-based high ADHD risk analyses. Results After Bonferroni correction ( p = 3.3 × 10 −5 ) we identified 80 medical conditions associated with PRS ADHD . The strongest evidence was seen with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.15, CI 1.11–1.18), obesity (OR 1.13, CI 1.11–1.15), and type 2 diabetes (OR 1.11, CI 1.09–1.14). Sex-stratified analysis generally showed similar associations in males and females. Out of all identified associations, 40% and 78% were also observed using ADHD diagnosis or questionnaire-based ADHD, respectively, as the predictor. Conclusions Overall our findings indicate that ADHD genetic liability is associated with an increased risk of a substantial number of medical conditions in undiagnosed individuals. These results highlight the need for timely detection and improved management of ADHD symptoms in adults.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":8},"references":61,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
