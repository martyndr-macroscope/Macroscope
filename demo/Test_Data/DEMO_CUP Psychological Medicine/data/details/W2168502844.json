The extent to which dementia occurs as a result of this change is unclear, and the studies which have investigated presumed cognitive deficits are reviewed. The theories put forward to explain the association between these two disorders and their possible significance to the understanding of the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":317},"references":150,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
