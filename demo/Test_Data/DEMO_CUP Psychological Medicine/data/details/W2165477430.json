Thus it is assumed that one or more genes within the deleted region are crucial to brain development. However, relatively little is known about how genetic variation at 22q11 affects brain structure and function. One gene on 22q11 is catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT): an enzyme that degrades dopamine and contains a functional polymorphism ( Val 158 Met ) affecting enzyme activity. Here, we investigated the effect of COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism on brain anatomy and cognition in adults with VCFS. Method The COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism was genotyped for 26 adults with VCFS on whom DNA was available. We explored its effects on regional brain volumes using hand tracing approaches; on regional grey- and white-matter density using computerized voxel-based analyses; and measures of attention, IQ, memory, executive and visuospatial function using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Results After corrections for multiple comparisons Val -hemizygous subjects, compared with Met -hemizygotes, had a significantly larger volume of frontal lobes. Also, Val -hemizygotes had significantly increased grey matter density in cerebellum, brainstem, and parahippocampal gyrus, and decreased white matter density in the cerebellum. No significant effects of COMT genotype on neurocognitive performance were found. Conclusions COMT genotype effects on brain anatomy in VCFS are not limited to frontal regions but also involve other structures previously implicated in VCFS. This suggests variation in COMT activity is implicated in brain development in VCFS.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":49},"references":60,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
