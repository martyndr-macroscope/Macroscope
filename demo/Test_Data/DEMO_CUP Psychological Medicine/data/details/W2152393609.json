At first it constituted a section of the Department of Psychiatry and for a while it formed part of the MRC Social Psychiatry Research Unit. However, in 1973 London University established a Chair of Child Psychiatry and since that time there has been a separate Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. The research in this field undertaken up to 1967 has been described previously (Rutter, 1968 a ) and the present report brings the account up to date with a summary of work carried out during the last eight years.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":11},"references":76,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
