Genetic epidemiology, which uses the classical ‘work-horse’ methods of family, twin and adoption studies, infers the action of genetic and environmental risk factors by observing the pattern of resemblance of traits or disorders in various classes of relatives. Methods that are utilized in genetic epidemiology can range from great simplicity, such as the odds ratio of a disorder in first-degree relatives of affected versus matched control probands, to substantial complexity, as seen in some advanced multivariate twin-family models (Truett et al . 1994). Of the quasi-experimental methods available to psychiatric geneticists that can tease apart the effects of genetic and shared-environmental factors (nature versus nurture), the twin method has become increasingly popular. This is probably due to the increasing availability of large population-based or volunteer twin registries (see the Oct 2002 issue of Twin Research on ‘Twin Registers as a Global Resource for Genetic Research’) that can be utilized to study psychiatric and drug abuse disorders. By contrast, due to changing social circumstances in most Western countries, adoption, even in the Scandinavian countries where most of the classic studies have been done, is becoming so rare that new adoption studies with younger age cohorts are hardly feasible. By contrast, gene-finding methods, which utilized variants of two different methods of linkage or association, have the goal of determining, on the human genome, the location and potential identity of susceptibility genes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":3},"references":30,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
