Method Subjects were 128 first-ever admissions for schizophrenia in 1963 to either of two mental hospital in Alberta, Canada. Follow-up continued until death or 1997. A symptom severity scale, with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (hospitalized), was used to collect time-series data on each subject and create life-course curves. Indices were constructed to summarize the information in each curve. Information on social functioning was also collected. Results Results were similar for men and women. The life-course curves showed marked variability of symptom severity across subjects and over time. The average score over the entire period of follow-up for the cohort indicated ‘moderate’ symptoms, and the change in average score from beginning to end of follow-up demonstrated a slight worsening of symptoms. The measures of social functioning indicated that only about one quarter of the patients had a good to excellent outcome. Conclusions The long-term course in schizophrenia is one of varying symptom severity, and for many patients, there is a poor overall outcome.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":23},"references":25,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
