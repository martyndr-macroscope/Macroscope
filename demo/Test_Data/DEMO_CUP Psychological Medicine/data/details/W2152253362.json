The patients were divided into 2 groups. The first group consisted of subjects who had become emaciated solely because of dieting, food refusal and excessive exercising (‘dieters’); the second of those who had used additional means to bring about weight loss such, as habitual vomiting and the abuse of purgatives (‘vomiters and purgers’). Most ‘dieters’ were intense, introverted, socially withdrawn individuals whose anorexic behaviour had started in response to psychological stress. They had become completely preoccupied with thoughts of food, eating and losing weight. Several did well in treatment, and recovered fully from their anorexic symptoms. ‘Vomiters and purgers’, on the other hand, were more outgoing in respect to personality. Most had previously been obese and, as they had been unable to keep themselves thin by simply abstaining from food, they had learnt to use other means to control their weight. These latter patients did less well in treatment. They continued to experience difficulty in controlling their weight, and the majority persisted with their abnormal behaviour.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":274},"references":11,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
