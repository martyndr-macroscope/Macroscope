A positive response was reported on the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40) in 22% of the students in the London group and 12% in the Cairo group, indicating that abnormal attitudes occur in this non-Western population. Six cases among the London sample fulfilled diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa, but no cases of either anorexia or bulimia were identified in the Cairo sample.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":15,"cited_by_count":238},"references":23,"networkCitations":15,"seed":false}
