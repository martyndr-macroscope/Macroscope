This scale is designed to be completed by ward staff. It should prove valuable in treatment studies and in studies which aim to investigate the correlates of aggressive behaviour. Studies using the scale demonstrate that when used in conjunction with a ward check list the scale has high reliability and validity.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":155},"references":37,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
