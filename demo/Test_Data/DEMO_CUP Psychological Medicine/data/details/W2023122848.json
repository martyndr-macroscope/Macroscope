Compared with controls, melancholics exhibited a pattern of bifrontal and right parietal impairment, which was independent of age, sex, handedness and drug administration. These findings confirm and extend prior studies and contrast with those we and others have reported in patients with schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":38},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
