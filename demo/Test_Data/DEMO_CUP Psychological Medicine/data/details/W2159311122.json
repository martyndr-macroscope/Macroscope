Standardized interviews, observer-rated instruments and self-rated questionnaires were employed both at entry and at completion of the follow-up period. After tracing, the positive response rate was 72%; one patient had died. At the time of follow-up 31% of those traced had made a complete recovery and 25% still fulfilled diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. Judged on behavioural symptoms 47·2% of responders had a ‘good’ outcome. Good outcome was associated with fewer social problems, higher social class, and a significant improvement in eating attitudes at follow-up. All outcome groups reported a reduction of interference by symptoms in other areas of life, and an improvement in mood state. No factors, including those described in previous studies, were identified which predicted outcome.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":53},"references":18,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
