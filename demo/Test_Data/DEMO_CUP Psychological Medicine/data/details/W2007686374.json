The patients were followed up throughout the interim period, during which time 17 experienced a psychotic relapse. Although there continued to be a negligible association between initial EE rating (established during the index admission) and relapse, a significant association between EE rating at 18 months and psychiatric status of the patient during the follow-up period emerged. Results are discussed in the context of recent interactional theories of the relationship between household EE and psychiatric morbidity.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":41},"references":25,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
