Subjects included 61 gay men (41 HIV −, 20 HIV +) who were assessed at the time of requesting their first HIV test and again 12 months later. Measures included a detailed standardized psychiatric interview (Present State Examination, PSE), a range of psychosocial self-report measures and a physical symptom checklist. There were no differences between the HIV + and HIV − groups in terms of self-reported symptoms. Multiple regression analysis showed that the symptom reporting was not associated with clinical or immunological markers of disease progression but was associated with measures of psychosocial distress. Although both groups showed elevated levels of psychosocial distress at the time of HIV testing, there were no differences between serostatus groups at follow-up. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the best predictors of PSE scores at follow-up were baseline PSE score and a history of psychiatric illness. Early HIV disease is not associated with increased psychosocial distress and symptom reporting is more closely related to psychological measures than to clinical or immunological markers of disease.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":30},"references":30,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
