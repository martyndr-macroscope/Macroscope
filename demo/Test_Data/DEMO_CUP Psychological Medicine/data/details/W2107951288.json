Evidence from a number of different disciplines shows that the presence of meaning in the noise is of critical importance in determining the persistence of physical reactions to the noise. The existing evidence linking noise with mental illness is found to be unsatisfactory. The concept of annoyance and the relevance of noise annoyance to mental illness are discussed. Some specific suggestions for further work are put forward.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":90},"references":112,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
