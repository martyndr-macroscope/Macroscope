An increased prevalence of impairment over a range of cognitive functions was observed in the Parkinson's disease patients as compared with their matched controls. The differences between the Parkinson's disease patients and controls could not be accounted for by factors such as depressed mood, effects of medication or motor impairment. Our findings are discussed in relation to the methodology of previous studies in this area and to the need for a comprehensive clinico-pathological longitudinal study.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":25},"references":54,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
