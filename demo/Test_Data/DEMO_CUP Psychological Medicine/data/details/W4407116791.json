We aimed to characterize PSIs, contributory factors, and reporter-identified solutions within community-based mental health services for working-age adults. Methods We obtained data on PSIs reported within English services from the National Reporting and Learning System. Of retrieved reports, we sampled all incidents reportedly involving ‘Death’, ‘Severe harm’, or ‘Moderate harm’, and random samples of a proportion of ‘Low harm’ or ‘No harm’ incidents. PSIs and contributory factors were classified through qualitative content analysis using existing frameworks. Frequencies and proportions of incident types were computed, and reporter-identified solutions were inductively categorized. Results Of 1825 sampled reports, 1443 were eligible and classified into nine categories. Harmful outcomes, wherein service influence was unclear, were widely observed, with self-harm the modal concern amongst ‘No harm’ (15.0%), ‘Low harm’ (62.8%), and ‘Moderate harm’ (37.6%) categories. Attempted suicides (51.7%) and suicides (52.1%) were the most frequently reported events under ‘Severe harm’ or ‘Death’ outcomes, respectively. Incidents common to most healthcare settings were identified (e.g. medication errors), alongside specialty-specific incidents (e.g. Mental Health Act administration errors). Contributory factors were wide-ranging, with situational failures (e.g. team function failures) and local working conditions (e.g. unmanageable workload) widely reported. Solution categories included service user-directed actions and policy introduction or reinforcement. Conclusions Study findings provide novel insights into incidents, contributory factors, and reported solutions within community-based mental healthcare. Targets for safety improvement are outlined, aimed at strengthening system-based prevention of incidents.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":32,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
