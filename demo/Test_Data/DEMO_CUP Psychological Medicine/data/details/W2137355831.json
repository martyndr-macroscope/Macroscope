The effects of sex, age, marital status and parity on first admission rates are examined in 114 patients admitted from a defined catchment area. The rate of first admission in females is almost twice that in males. Using logistic regression analysis one significant factor accounting for this sex difference emerges: female parity. The effect of parity is evident up to the age of 54, and it entirely accounts for the sex difference in relative risk. Non-parous females have a lower relative risk of admission than males. An apparent effect of marital status is only significant in females, and is accounted for by parity and age.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":33},"references":23,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
