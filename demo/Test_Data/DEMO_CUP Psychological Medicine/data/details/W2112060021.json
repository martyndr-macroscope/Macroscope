The psychiatric ratings and Wechsler scores were obtained again after 6 months' treatment with thiothixene or thioridazine. Results revealed that those patients who displayed therapeutic benefit from the neuroleptic treatment displayed greater pre-treatment electrodermal activity and higher skin conductance levels, compared with schizophrenics who did not benefit. No effect for laterality was noted.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":19},"references":18,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
