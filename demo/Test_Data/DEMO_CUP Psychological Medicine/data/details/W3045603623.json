However, the biological processes associated with regional structural perturbations remain elusive. Methods We applied integrative omics analysis to investigate specialized transcriptome signatures and translational determinants associated with regional grey matter variations in 2737 MDD patients relative to 3098 controls by summarizing the results from gene co-expression network analysis of Allen human brain transcriptome profiles in six donors, enrichment analysis of gene-sets and cellular structure from rodents and mediation analysis of BrainSpan proteome profile in six donors. Results We found convergent alterations of grey matter volume in MDD were associated with transcriptome profiles enriched for synaptic transmission, metabolism, immune processes and transmembrane transport. Genes with abnormal expression in post-mortem tissue in MDD were also associated with transcriptome signatures. Further gene co-expression network and enrichment analysis of MDD-related genes in these signatures revealed the modules with higher neuronal expression were enriched in the medial temporal cortex and temporo-parietal junction with genes differentially associated with neuronal development and metabolism. Also, the modules with higher non-neuronal (e.g. astrocyte and oligodendrocyte) expression were concentrated in the rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and were separately associated with immune response and transmembrane transport. Moreover, proteins as the gene expression products mediated the association between transcriptome signatures and brain volume changes in the visual and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Conclusions Our multidimensional analyses offer a novel approach to detect specific biological pathways that capture regional structural variations in MDD, which suggests structural endophenotypes associated with MDD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":13},"references":67,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
