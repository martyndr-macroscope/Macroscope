Correlations between self-ratings and informantratings were positive and significant for all three MNTS and for EPI Extraversion and Lie scales, but not for EPI Neuroticism, where the lack of subject-informant correlation was attributed to contamination of the self-rating of the trait measure by current abnormalities of mental state. Further analyses supported previous evidence that the MNTS ‘Validity’ scale may predict the development of psychiatric symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":11},"references":31,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
