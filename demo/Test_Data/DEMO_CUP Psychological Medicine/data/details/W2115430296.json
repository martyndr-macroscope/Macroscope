However, cohesion analyses of disordered speech seem to offer both a simple and potentially useful tool for clinical diagnosis. This study was designed to test whether psychiatrists can use the rudiments of this analysis in order to differentiate between two diagnostic groups, manics and schizophrenics.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":20},"references":9,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
