Methods From FDA reviews, we included data from all phase 2/3 efficacy trials of alprazolam extended-release (Xanax XR) for the treatment of panic disorder. A search for matching publications was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Publication bias was examined by comparing: (1) overall trial results (positive or not) according to the FDA v. corresponding publications; (2) effect size (Hedges's g) based on FDA data v. published data. Results The FDA review showed that five trials were conducted, only one of which (20%) was positive. Of the four not-positive trials, two were published conveying a positive outcome; the other two were not published. Thus, according to the published literature, three trials were conducted and all (100%) were positive. Alprazolam's effect size calculated using FDA data was 0.33 (CI 95% 0.07–0.60) v. 0.47 (CI 95% 0.30–0.65) using published data, an increase of 0.14, or 42%. Conclusions Publication bias substantially inflates the apparent efficacy of alprazolam XR.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":44,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
