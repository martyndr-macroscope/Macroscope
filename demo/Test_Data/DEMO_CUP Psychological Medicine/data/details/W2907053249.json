Many of these studies are limited in scope, and have not fully examined possible mechanisms explaining how ID affect suicidal behavior. Methods This study assesses how self-reported ID relate to suicide ideation and attempts in six distinct and geographically diverse samples of adults ( n = 2706) and one sample of adolescents ( n = 436). Participants responded to a variety of self-report questionnaires and interviews. Results Contrary to our hypothesis, self-reported ID were only associated with suicidal ideation in two samples, one of which was the adolescent sample. Largely consistent with our predictions, self-reported ID exhibited an indirect effect on suicide attempts through versatility of NSSI in four of the five adult samples tested. Finally, the indirect effects of self-reported ID on suicide attempts through NSSI versatility did not act indirectly through behaviorally assessed pain tolerance. Conclusions We found that, in adults, self-reported ID are not associated with suicidal ideation, but are connected with a history of suicide attempts, through an indirect effect via NSSI. Our findings also indicate that the mechanism of action leading from self-reported ID to suicidal behavior may differ between adolescents and adults, and relate to suicidal behavior independent of pain tolerance. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":24},"references":69,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
