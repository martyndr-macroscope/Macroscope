However, not all children with anxiety/withdrawal problems will experience an AD in later life. Previous studies have shown that the severity of childhood anxiety/withdrawal accounts for some of the variability in AD outcomes. However, no studies to date have investigated how variation in features of anxiety/withdrawal may relate to continuity prognoses. The present research addresses this gap. Methods Data were gathered as part of the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a 40-year population birth cohort of 1265 children born in Christchurch, New Zealand. Fifteen childhood anxiety/withdrawal items were measured at 7–9 years and AD outcomes were measured at various interviews from 15 to 40 years. Six network models were estimated. Two models estimated the network structure of childhood anxiety/withdrawal items independently for males and females. Four models estimated childhood anxiety/withdrawal items predicting adolescent AD (14–21 years) and adult AD (21–40 years) in both males and females. Results Approximately 40% of participants met the diagnostic criteria for an AD during both the adolescent (14–21 years) and adult (21–40 years) outcome periods. Outcome networks showed that items measuring social and emotional anxious/withdrawn behaviours most frequently predicted AD outcomes. Items measuring situation-based fears and authority figure-specific anxious/withdrawn behaviour did not consistently predict AD outcomes. This applied across both the male and female subsamples. Conclusions Social and emotional anxious/withdrawn behaviours in middle childhood appear to carry increased risk for AD outcomes in both adolescence and adulthood.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":11},"references":83,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
