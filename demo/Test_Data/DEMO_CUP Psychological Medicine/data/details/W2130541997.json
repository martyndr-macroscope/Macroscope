Major life events and the degree of social support were of importance. Failure to improve was associated with major negative life events; in the absence of such events, improvement seemed likely to occur given a high degree of social Support; major positive events appeared to be associated with improvement, regardless of the degree of social interaction. These factors, and the initial and final GHQ scores, are inter-related in a complex manner and it is suggested that these findings merit further investigation on a larger sample of patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":15},"references":6,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
