Major depressed patients with melancholia/psychotic features exhibited a significantly lower mitogen-induced blast transformation as compared to minor and simple major depressed patients. The lymphocyte responses to the three mitogens were significantly inversely related to baseline cortisol values and postdexamethasone β-endorphin values. The proliferative capacity of lymphocytes to stimulation with PHA and PWM was significantly and positively related to UFC excretion. Up to 45% of the variance in the immune responses to the mitogens was explained by the baseline cortisol, post-dexamethasone β-endorphin and UFC values.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":63},"references":72,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
