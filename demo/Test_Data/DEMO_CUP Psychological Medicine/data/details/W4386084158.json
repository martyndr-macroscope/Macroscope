Successful regulation of these affective experiences is important for good mental health and has been proposed to depend on affective control. The present study examined whether improving affective control through a computerised affective control training app (AffeCT) would benefit adolescent mental health. Methods One-hundred and ninety-nine participants (11–19 years) were assigned to complete 2 weeks of AffeCT or placebo training on an app. Affective control (i.e. affective inhibition, affective updating and affective shifting), mental health and emotion regulation were assessed at pre- and post-training. Mental health and emotion regulation were assessed again one month and one year later. Results Compared with the placebo group, the AffeCT group showed significantly greater improvements in affective control on the trained measure. AffeCT did not, relative to placebo, lead to better performance on untrained measures of affective control. Pre- to post-training change in affective control covaried with pre- to post-training change in mental health problems in the AffeCT but not the placebo group. These mental health benefits of AffeCT were only observed immediately following training and did not extend to 1 month or year post-training. Conclusion In conclusion, the study provides preliminary evidence that AffeCT may confer short-term preventative benefits for adolescent mental health.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":60,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
