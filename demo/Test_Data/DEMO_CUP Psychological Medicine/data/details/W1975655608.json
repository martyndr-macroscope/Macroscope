T 1 values were raised, in both cortical grey and white matter, in Korsakoff's syndrome and multi-infarct dementia. T 1 values appear of little value in studying the neuropathological changes in ATD in relationship to the neuropsychological deficits, but can assist in the differential diagnosis of pre-senile dementia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":41},"references":30,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
