This association could not be accounted for by psychosocial factors. Offences were unrelated to symptoms of premenstrual tension. When considering treatment, recurrent behavioural changes rather than subjective symptoms should be looked for.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":65},"references":16,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
