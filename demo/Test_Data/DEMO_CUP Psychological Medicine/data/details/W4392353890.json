We compare the associations between environmental exposures during childhood/prior to disorder onset with the risk of developing SCZ and BD. Methods: We conducted a Swedish register-based nested case–control study using 4184 SCZ cases and 18 681 BD cases diagnosed 1988–2013. Cases were matched to five controls by birth year, birth region, and sex. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) for SCZ and BD for each exposure (severe childhood infections, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), substance use disorders (SUDs), urban birth/longest residence). Results: All SUD types were associated with very high risk (IRR 4.9–25.5), and all forms of ACEs with higher risk (IRR 1.5–4.3) for both disorders. In the mutually adjusted models, ACEs demonstrated slightly higher risk for BD (SCZ IRR 1.30, 1.19-1.42; BD IRR 1.49, 1.44–1.55), while for SUD, risk was higher for SCZ (SCZ IRR 9.43, 8.15–10.92; BD IRR 5.50, 5.15–5.88). Infections were associated with increased risk of BD (IRR 1.21, 1.17–1.26) but not SCZ. Urban birth and urban longest residence were associated with higher risk of SCZ (IRR 1.19, 1.03–1.37), while only the combination of urban birth and rural longest residence showed higher risk for BD (IRR 1.24, 1.13–1.35). Conclusions: There were both shared and unique environmental risk factors: SUDs and ACEs were risk factors for both disorders, while infections were more strongly associated with BD and urbanicity with SCZ.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":5},"references":62,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
