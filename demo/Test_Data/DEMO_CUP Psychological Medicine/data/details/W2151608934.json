An on-going evaluation programme provided data for a variety of parameters ranging from ‘theoretical knowledge’ to ‘clinical skills’. Results indicated that in most areas of performance the median FMG started at a level substantially lower than that of the median AMG and very slowly caught up. When achievement criteria were utilized it became apparent that, at least by the third year of training, ‘superior’ FMGs could equal or surpass the median performance of ‘superior’ AMGs, whereas ‘marginal’ residents, whether foreign or native-born, seldom attained even competence in most major spheres of functioning. Implications of these findings and those in related studies are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":17,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
