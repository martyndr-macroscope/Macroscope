O. Schild of the Department of Pharmacology, University College London (U.C.L.) and to Dr. (now Professor) Michael Shepherd of the Department of Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, University of London, for studies in human psychopharmacology. The research assistants initially employed were Dr. Lorna Wing, Dr. J. D. Montagu, and Dr. Malcolm Lader and work was carried out at U.C.L., the Institute of Psychiatry, and Runwell Hospital, Essex. In 1966, the Medical Research Council assumed responsibility by appointing Dr. Lader to their External Scientific Staff. Other support has come from the Bethlem Research Fund and from the pharmaceutical industry, in particular Roche (U.K.) Ltd. and May and Baker, Ltd. A group of six to eight workers has thus been built up based mainly in the Institute of Psychiatry but with continuing links to U.C.L. At present our team comprises pharmacologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, a physiologist, a chemist, and a mathematician. Several workers from abroad on British Council or Commonwealth Fellowships have been attached to the team at various times, and students for higher degrees such as PhD and MD have been welcomed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":54,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
