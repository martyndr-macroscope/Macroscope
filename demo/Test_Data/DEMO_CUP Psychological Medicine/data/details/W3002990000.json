We aimed to evaluate the association between antipsychotic use in pregnancy and GDM. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library databases up to March 2019, for data from observational studies assessing the association between gestational antipsychotic use and GDM. Non-English studies, animal studies, case reports, conference abstracts, book chapters, reviews and summaries were excluded. The primary outcome was GDM. Estimates were pooled using a random effect model, with the I 2 statistic used to estimate heterogeneity of results. Our study protocol was registered with PROSPERO number: CRD42018095014. Results In total 10 cohort studies met the inclusion criteria in our systematic review with 6642 exposed and 1 860 290 unexposed pregnancies. Six studies were included in the meta-analysis with a pooled adjusted relative risk of 1.24 overall [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–1.42]. The I 2 result suggested low heterogeneity between studies ( I 2 = 6.7%, p = 0.373). Conclusion We found that the use of antipsychotic medications during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of GDM in mothers. However, the evidence is still insufficient, especially for specific drug classes. We recommend more studies to investigate this association for specific drug classes, dosages and comorbidities to help clinicians to manage the risk of GDM if initiation or continuation of antipsychotic prescriptions during pregnancy is needed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":34},"references":56,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
