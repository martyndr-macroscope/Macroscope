Findings confirm the association between stressful life events in the course of the life span and five outcomes: PTSD, intrusion and avoidance tendencies, psychiatric symptomatology, and impaired social functioning. Different life events have different effects. War captivity made the strongest contribution to all dependent variables.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":46},"references":33,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
