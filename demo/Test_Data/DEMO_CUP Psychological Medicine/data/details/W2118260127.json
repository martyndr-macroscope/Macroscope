A significant association between chronic fatigue and psychosocial morbidity, somatic symptoms and escape-avoidance coping styles was shown. Chronic fatigue cases were significantly more likely to have a past psychiatric history and a current psychiatric diagnosis based on a standardized clinical interview. Twenty-three of the cases fulfilled criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Such cases were significantly more fatigued than those not fulfilling criteria, but had little excess psychiatric disorder. A principal components analysis provided some evidence for chronic fatigue being separable from general psychosocial morbidity but not from the tendency to have other somatic complaints. Past psychiatric history and psychological distress at the time of the viral illness were risk factors for psychiatric ‘caseness’ 6 months later, while presence of fatigue, psychologising attributional style and sick certification were significant risk factors for CFS. These findings extend a previous questionnaire study of predictors of chronic ‘post-viral’ fatigue.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":52},"references":49,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
