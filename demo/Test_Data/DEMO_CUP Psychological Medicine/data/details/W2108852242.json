The results suggested that high levels of anxiety were experienced before admission to hospital, between admission and surgery and following surgery, and were not restricted to the immediate pre-operative period. Only a small percentage of patients reached their maximum level of anxiety on the morning of surgery. These results have implications for those planning interventions to alleviate anxiety associated with surgery and for those studying surgical stress as a model for other naturally occurring stresses.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":274},"references":19,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
