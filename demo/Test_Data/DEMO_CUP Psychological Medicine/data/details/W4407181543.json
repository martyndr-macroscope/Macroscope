However, studies have been limited by small and selected samples. Moreover, the role of early life trauma, a key risk factor for psychosis, in the associations is unknown. Methods Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort, we investigated the associations between intellectual impairment, psychotic disorders, and psychotic experiences, and assessed the mediating role of trauma in childhood. Individuals with intellectual impairment were identified using a multisource measure utilizing indicators from ALSPAC combined with health and administrative records. Psychotic disorder diagnoses were extracted through linkage to primary care records. Psychotic experiences were assessed at ages 18 and 24 using the semi-structured Psychosis-Like Symptoms interview (PLIKSi). Trauma between ages 5 and 11 was assessed with questionnaires and interviews administered to children and parents at multiple ages. Multiple imputation was performed to mitigate bias due to missing data. Results The maximum sample after multiple imputation was 9,407. We found associations between intellectual impairment and psychotic disorders (OR = 4.57; 95%CI: 1.56–13.39). Evidence was weaker in the case of psychotic experiences (OR = 1.63; 95%CI: 0.93–2.84). There was some evidence suggesting a mediating role of trauma in the associations between intellectual impairment and psychotic experiences (OR = 1.09; 95%CI: 1.03–1.15). Complete records analyses yielded comparable estimates. Conclusions Intellectual impairment is associated with psychotic disorders and experiences in adulthood. Research into the contribution of trauma could shape intervention strategies for psychotic disorders in this population.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":37,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
