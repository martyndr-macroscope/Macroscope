Technology provides an opportunity with advantages for psychological intervention. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyze the characteristics and effectiveness of technology-based interventions for parents to promote children's physical health or psychological issues. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for articles about parenting skills for prevention or treatment of children's physical or psychological concerns using technology. We explore the aim of the intervention with parents, kind of problem with children, intervention model, instruments, methodological quality, and risk of bias. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. Results Twenty-four studies were included in the systematic review and a meta-analysis of 22 studies was performed to find out the effects of intervention depending on the kind of problem, intervention model, follow-up, type of intervention, type of control condition, and type of outcome data. Results show the usefulness of technology-based therapy for parenting interventions with moderate effect sizes for intervention groups with statistically significant differences from control groups. Conclusions Technology-based parenting programs have positive effects on parenting and emotional wellbeing of parents and children. Attendance and participation level in technology-based treatment increase compared with traditional parenting intervention.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":65},"references":56,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
