The majority of persons with BPD engage in self-injury and up to 10% die by suicide – rendering persons with this condition at exceptionally elevated risk of comorbidity and premature mortality. Better characterization of clinical risk factors among persons with BPD who die by suicide is urgently needed. Methods We examined patterns of medical and psychiatric diagnoses (1580 to 1700 Phecodes) among persons with BPD who died by suicide ( n = 379) via a large suicide death data resource and biobank. In phenotype-based phenome-wide association tests, we compared these individuals to three other groups: (1) persons who died by suicide without a history of BPD ( n = 9468), (2) persons still living with a history of BPD diagnosis ( n = 280), and (3) persons who died by suicide with a different personality disorder (other PD n = 589). Results Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that persons with BPD who died by suicide were more likely to present with co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses, and have a documented history of self-harm in the medical system prior to death, relative to suicides without BPD. Posttraumatic stress disorder was more elevated among those with BPD who died by suicide relative to the other PD group. Conclusions We found significant differences among persons with BPD who died by suicide and all other comparison groups. Such differences may be clinically informative for identifying high-risk subtypes and providing targeted intervention approaches.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":35,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
