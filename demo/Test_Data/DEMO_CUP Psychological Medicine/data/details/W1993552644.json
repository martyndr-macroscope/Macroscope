Neuropsychological investigation while these symptoms were resolving revealed impairment on face processing tests. We suggest that these impairments contributed to his Cotard delusion by heightening feelings of unreality, and that the underlying pathophysiology and neuropsychology of the Cotard delusion may be related to other problems involving delusional misidentification.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":86},"references":42,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
