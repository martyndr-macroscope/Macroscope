This study examined trends in non-fatal suicidal behaviors among adults in the USA. Methods Data were obtained from adults 18–65 years of age who participated in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), including mental health assessment, from 2009 to 2017 ( n = 335 359). Examinations of data involved trend analysis methods with the use of logistic regressions and interaction terms. Results Suicidal ideation showed fluctuation from 2009 to 2017, whereas suicide plan and attempt showed significantly positive linear trends with the odds increasing by an average of 3% and 4%, respectively. Suicide plan increased the most for females and adults ages 18–34, and attempt increased the most for adults with drug dependence. Both plan and attempt increased the most among adults who either had mental illness but were not in treatment or had no mental illness. Conclusions Given attempted suicide is the strongest known risk factor for suicide death, reducing non-fatal suicidal behaviors including attempt are important public health and clinical goals. The interactional findings of age, sex, mental health status, and drug dependence point toward the importance of tailoring prevention efforts to various sociodemographic and clinical factors.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":11},"references":40,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
