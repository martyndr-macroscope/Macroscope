Recently, it has come to encompass changes in regional brain X-ray absorption density. The artefacts prone to be encountered in density measurements are reviewed, and illustrated by a series of studies carried out using a CT 1010 scanner. They are shown to be more important than hitherto assumed in the interpretation of CT scan research.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":29},"references":41,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
