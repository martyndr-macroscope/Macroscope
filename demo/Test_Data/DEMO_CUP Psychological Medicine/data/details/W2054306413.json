Within a sample of 308 depressed psychiatric inpatients, suicide attempters were younger than non-attempters and were identified by a pattern of chronic interpersonal maladjustment reflected clinically in withdrawal from social contact and the display of hostility or irritability toward others.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":34},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
