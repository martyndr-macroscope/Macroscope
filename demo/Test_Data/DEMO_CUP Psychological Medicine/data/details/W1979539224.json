Being female, older and heavier are far more strongly associated with anorexic and bulimic symptoms than is social class. ESI approximations of the DSM-III criteria for anorexia nervosa or bulimia suggest that while both conditions are rare (less than 1%), bulimia is the more prevalent disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":202},"references":67,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
