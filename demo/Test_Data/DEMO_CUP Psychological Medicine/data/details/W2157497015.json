Very few of the children studied were consistently overactive or inattentive. Mothers' reports of overactivity tallied with a measure of conduct disturbance but not with objective measurements of activity or attention.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":60},"references":54,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
