There was a significant association between the presence of high evening cortisol and co-morbid dysthymia. This was independent of age or sex. No positive association was found between the presence of low morning DHEA and any co-morbid diagnosis. However, co-morbid panic or phobic disorder was significantly associated with the absence of this endocrine abnormality. These findings suggest that specific endocrine disturbances may be associated with different patterns of co-morbidity during an episode of major depression in this age group.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":65},"references":15,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
