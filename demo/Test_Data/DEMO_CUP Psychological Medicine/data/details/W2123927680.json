Thirst was surprisingly common, occurring in 67% of patients, in spite of the fact that they had been maintained on relatively low levels of lithium, and was due principally to the lithium rather than to other psychotropic drugs. Urine flow and impaired renal water absorption correlated with the serum lithium level and the length of treatment in the patients, despite the fact that few were clinically polyuric. The pattern of the results confirms previous suggestions that lithium may stimulate the thirst mechanism directly as well as via an increased renal resistance to vasopressin. The possible implications in terms of clinical response are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":10},"references":29,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
