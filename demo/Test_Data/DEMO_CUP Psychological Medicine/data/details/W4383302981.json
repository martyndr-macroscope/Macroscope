This information is essential so that clinical services can provide adequate resources to supporting cognitive functioning. Thus, we investigated this prevalence in individuals in the early course of psychosis or depression. Methods A comprehensive cognitive test battery comprising 12 tests was completed by 1286 individuals aged 15–41 (mean age 25.07, s.d. 5.88) from the PRONIA study at baseline: HC ( N = 454), clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR; N = 270), recent-onset depression (ROD; N = 267), and recent-onset psychosis (ROP; N = 295). Z-scores were calculated to estimate the prevalence of moderate or severe deficits or strengths (&gt;2 s.d. or 1–2 s.d. below or above HC, respectively) for each cognitive test. Results Impairment in at least two cognitive tests was as follows: ROP (88.3% moderately, 45.1% severely impaired), CHR (71.2% moderately, 22.4% severely impaired), ROD (61.6% moderately, 16.2% severely impaired). Across clinical groups, impairments were most prevalent in tests of working memory, processing speed, and verbal learning. Above average performance (&gt;1 s.d. ) in at least two tests was present for 40.5% ROD, 36.1% CHR, 16.1% ROP, and was &gt;2 SDs in 1.8% ROD, 1.4% CHR, and 0% ROP. Conclusions These findings suggest that interventions should be tailored to the individual, with working memory, processing speed, and verbal learning likely to be important transdiagnostic targets.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":16},"references":57,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
