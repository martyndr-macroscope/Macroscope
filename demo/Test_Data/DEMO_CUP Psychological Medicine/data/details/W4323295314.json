First-episode psychosis (FEP) comprises a group of disorders that show great clinical and long-term outcome heterogeneity, and the extent to which genetic, familial and environmental factors account for predicting the long-term outcome in FEP patients remains scarcely known. Methods The SEGPEPs is an inception cohort study of 243 first-admission patients with FEP who were followed-up for a mean of 20.9 years. FEP patients were thoroughly evaluated by standardized instruments, with 164 patients providing DNA. Aggregate scores estimated in large populations for polygenic risk score (PRS-Sz), exposome risk score (ERS-Sz) and familial load score for schizophrenia (FLS-Sz) were ascertained. Long-term functioning was assessed by means of the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) was used as a standard method to estimate the effect of interaction of risk factors. Results Our results showed that a high FLS-Sz gave greater explanatory capacity for long-term outcome, followed by the ERS-Sz and then the PRS-Sz. The PRS-Sz did not discriminate significantly between recovered and non-recovered FEP patients in the long term. No significant interaction between the PRS-Sz, ERS-Sz or FLS-Sz regarding the long-term functioning of FEP patients was found. Conclusions Our results support an additive model of familial antecedents of schizophrenia, environmental risk factors and polygenic risk factors as contributors to a poor long-term functional outcome for FEP patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":13},"references":68,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
