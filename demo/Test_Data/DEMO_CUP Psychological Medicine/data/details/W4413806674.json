However, these tools were created in high-income countries (HICs) with limited investigation of the psychometrics of these tools when used in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, there is a need to examine the psychometric properties of these measures in LMICs. The present investigation aimed to examine the use of the MINI in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. Methods A multicountry comparison of the validity and reliability of the MINI was conducted in a study of 954 participants ( n = 667 cases; n = 287 controls) with and without a psychotic spectrum disorder, defined as any psychotic or bipolar spectrum disorder for the NeuroGAP – Psychosis study. Test–retest reliability of the MINI was examined in a subset of 303 participants ( n = 164 cases; n = 139 controls) from the overall sample. Results Results revealed the MINI and SCID provided excellent diagnostic accuracy with area under the curve (AUC) values of .91 ( SE = .01) for the MINI and .95 ( SE = .01) for the SCID. Positive predictive values (PPV) were the highest for the SCID (93.8%) and slightly lower for the MINI (88.7%). Reliability analyses revealed substantial agreement for psychotic and bipolar diagnostic groups. Conclusions Similar patterns of results were observed at the country level with a few notable differences. Limitations and future directions are discussed.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":25,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
