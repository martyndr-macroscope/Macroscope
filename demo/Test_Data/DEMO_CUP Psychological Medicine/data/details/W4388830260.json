Longitudinal studies, while rare, would clarify the development of cardiometabolic dysregulations over time. Therefore, we longitudinally investigated the association of CT with the 9-year course of MetS components. Methods Participants ( N = 2958) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were assessed four times across 9 years. The CT interview retrospectively assessed childhood emotional neglect and physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Metabolic outcomes encompassed continuous MetS components (waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, blood pressure [BP], and glucose) and count of clinically elevated MetS components. Mixed-effects models estimated sociodemographic- and lifestyle-adjusted longitudinal associations of CT with metabolic outcomes over time. Time interactions evaluated change in these associations. Results CT was reported by 49% of participants. CT was consistently associated with increased waist ( b = 0.32, s.e. = 0.10, p = 0.001), glucose ( b = 0.02, s.e. = 0.01, p &lt; 0.001), and count of MetS components ( b = 0.04, s.e. = 0.01, p &lt; 0.001); and decreased HDL cholesterol ( b = −0.01, s.e. &lt;0.01, p = .020) and systolic BP ( b = −0.33, s.e. = 0.13, p = 0.010). These associations were mainly driven by severe CT and unaffected by lifestyle. Only systolic BP showed a CT-by-time interaction, where CT was associated with lower systolic BP initially and with higher systolic BP at the last follow-up. Conclusions Over time, adults with CT have overall persistent poorer metabolic outcomes than their non-maltreated peers. Individuals with CT have an increased risk for cardiometabolic disease and may benefit from monitoring and early interventions targeting metabolism.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":11},"references":52,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
