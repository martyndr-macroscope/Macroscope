Rather, service providers and purchasers should focus on developing community-based care (including increased provision of 24-hour nursed beds) by ensuring that resources released through earlier closure programmes have been redeployed for their intended use and by accessing additional pump-priming or bridging resources.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":78},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
