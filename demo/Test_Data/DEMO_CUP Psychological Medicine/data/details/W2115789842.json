Results indicated that amnesia of the traumatic event was associated with less acute post-traumatic stress, intrusive symptoms, perceived injury, and fear of future risk. A proportion of head injured patients reported intrusive and avoidance symptoms despite being amnesic of their trauma. Findings are discussed in terms of the differential post-traumatic adjustment of head injured and non-head injured traumatized patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":56},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
