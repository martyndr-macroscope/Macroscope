Twelve per cent of men and 19% of women were classified by the PSE as psychiatric ‘cases’. Forty per cent of women and 47% of men reported at least one major social problem; effects of diabetes on everyday activities were common. There were associations between medical and social variables. The clinical implications are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":79},"references":29,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
