A subgroup of schizophrenia patients with elevated inflammatory or immune-dysregulation has been reported by previous studies. However, little is known about epigenetic changes in genes related to immune activation in never-treated first-episode patients with schizophrenia (FES) and its consistency with that in treated long-term ill (LTS) patients. Methods In this study, epigenome-wide profiling with a DNA methylation array was applied using blood samples of both FES and LTS patients, as well as their corresponding healthy controls. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and k -means clustering were performed to parse heterogeneity of schizophrenia, and the consistency of subtyping results from two cohorts. was tested. Results This study identified a subtype of patients in FES participants (47.5%) that exhibited widespread methylation level alterations of genes enriched in immune cell activity and a significantly higher proportion of neutrophils. This clustering of FES patients was validated in LTS patients, with high correspondence in epigenetic and clinical features across two cohorts Conclusions In summary, this study demonstrated a subtype of schizophrenia patients across both FES and LTS cohorts, defined by widespread alterations in methylation profile of genes related to immune function and distinguishing clinical features. This finding illustrates the promise of novel treatment strategies targeting immune dysregulation for a subpopulation of schizophrenia patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":48,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
