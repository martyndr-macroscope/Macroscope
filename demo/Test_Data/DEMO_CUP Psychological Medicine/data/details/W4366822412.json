Successful treatment of OCD is restricted by the limited knowledge about its pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of OCD using electroencephalographic (EEG) event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited from multiple tasks to characterise disorder-related differences in underlying brain activity across multiple neural processes. Methods ERP data were obtained from 25 OCD patients and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) by recording EEG during flanker and go/nogo tasks. Error-related negativity (ERN) was elicited by the flanker task, while N200 and P300 were generated using the go/nogo task. Primary comparisons of the neural response amplitudes and the topographical distribution of neural activity were conducted using scalp field differences across all time points and electrodes. Results Compared to HCs, the OCD group showed altered ERP distributions. Contrasting with the previous literature on ERN and N200 topographies in OCD where fronto-central negative voltages were reported, we detected positive voltages. Additionally, the P300 was found to be less negative in the frontal regions. None of these ERP findings were associated with OCD symptom severity. Conclusions These results indicate that individuals with OCD show altered frontal neural activity across multiple executive function-related processes, supporting the frontal dysfunction theory of OCD. Furthermore, due to the lack of association between altered ERPs and OCD symptom severity, they may be considered potential candidate endophenotypes for OCD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":99,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
