In a national population study utilizing the short form of the Present State Examination, audiotapes of interviews were used to demonstrate the reliability of ratings. The classification of ‘cases’ was found to be related to self-reports of nervous trouble and help–seeking for such problems. Associations between the rate of psychiatric disorder and demographic factors were similar to those found in previous community surveys. In general, the method of psychiatric assessment was considered to be satisfactory. Recommendations are made for the monitoring of interviews in similar large-scale investigations.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":82},"references":26,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
