Methods We examined whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for consumption and problem subscales of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C, AUDIT-P) in the UK Biobank (UKB; N = 121 630) correlate with alcohol outcomes in four independent samples: an ascertained cohort, the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA; N = 6850), and population-based cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; N = 5911), Generation Scotland (GS; N = 17 461), and an independent subset of UKB ( N = 245 947). Regression models and survival analyses tested whether the PRS were associated with the alcohol-related outcomes. Results In COGA, AUDIT-P PRS was associated with alcohol dependence, AUD symptom count, maximum drinks ( R 2 = 0.47–0.68%, p = 2.0 × 10 −8 –1.0 × 10 −10 ), and increased likelihood of onset of alcohol dependence (hazard ratio = 1.15, p = 4.7 × 10 −8 ); AUDIT-C PRS was not an independent predictor of any phenotype. In ALSPAC, the AUDIT-C PRS was associated with alcohol dependence ( R 2 = 0.96%, p = 4.8 × 10 −6 ). In GS, AUDIT-C PRS was a better predictor of weekly alcohol use ( R 2 = 0.27%, p = 5.5 × 10 −11 ), while AUDIT-P PRS was more associated with problem drinking ( R 2 = 0.40%, p = 9.0 × 10 −7 ). Lastly, AUDIT-P PRS was associated with ICD-based alcohol-related disorders in the UKB subset ( R 2 = 0.18%, p &lt; 2.0 × 10 −16 ). Conclusions AUDIT-P PRS was associated with a range of alcohol-related phenotypes across population-based and ascertained cohorts, while AUDIT-C PRS showed less utility in the ascertained cohort. We show that AUDIT-P is genetically correlated with both use and misuse and demonstrate the influence of ascertainment schemes on PRS analyses.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":33},"references":57,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
