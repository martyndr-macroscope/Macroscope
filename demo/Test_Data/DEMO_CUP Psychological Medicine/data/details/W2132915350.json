Obese subjects, particularly women, tended to overestimate body width and to dislike their bodies, but neither of these factors predicted success in losing weight. Age of onset of obesity was not related to degree of adult obesity or to accuracy of estimation of body width.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":24},"references":30,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
