It has also been reported that prenatal adverse conditions, such as prenatal maternal stress, drug taking, tobacco smoking or medical complications, may be associated with an increased risk of mental disorders in the offspring. Prenatal adversity is investigated here for the first time as a potential risk factor in the diagnosis of BPD. Method A total of 100 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BPD and 100 matched healthy controls underwent semi-structured interviews about the course of pregnancy, maternal stressors, birth complications and childhood trauma. Further information was obtained from the participants' mothers and from prenatal medical records. Results Borderline patients were significantly more often exposed to adverse intrauterine conditions, such as prenatal tobacco exposure ( p =0.004), medical complications ( p =0.008), prenatal maternal traumatic stress ( p =0.015), familial conflicts ( p =0.004), low social support ( p =0.004) and partnership problems during pregnancy ( p =0.014). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the reported prenatal risk factors accounted for 25.7% of the variance in BPD. Prenatal tobacco exposure [odds ratio (OR) 3.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49–7.65, p =0.004] and medical complications (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.29–6.38, p =0.010) emerged as important predictors. After controlling for childhood adversity and parental socio-economic status (SES), prenatal risk factors predicted relevant borderline subdomains, such as impulsivity, affective instability, identity disturbance, dissociation and severity of borderline symptoms. Conclusions This study provides evidence of an association between prenatal adversity and the diagnosis of BPD. Our findings suggest that prenatal adversity may constitute a potential risk factor in the pathogenesis of BPD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":24},"references":72,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
