Suicide prevention strategies are shifting toward transdiagnostic perspectives examining interrelated risk factors, but their interrelationships remain unclear. This study investigated relationships between psychopathological dimensions, impulsivity, and childhood maltreatment in individuals with suicidal ideation (SI), comparing those with versus without intention to act using network analysis. Methods Data were obtained from the Suicide Prevention and Intervention Study project. Participants were categorized into two groups based on their intention to act according to the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Psychological symptoms, impulsivity traits, and childhood maltreatment were assessed. Network analysis was performed, and centrality measures were computed. Results A total of 1,265 individuals were categorized into the SI without intention to act ( n = 345) and SI with intention to act ( n = 920) groups. The former showed lower depression and hostility scores, and lower prevalence of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Network analyses revealed that in the SI without intention to act group, obsessive-compulsive symptoms were central, connecting to depression and anxiety, while negatively correlating with non-planning impulsivity. In contrast, the SI with intention to act group showed a more densely interconnected network where emotional abuse served as a bridge between childhood maltreatment and other psychopathological dimensions. Conclusions This study identifies symptom interaction patterns between individuals with SI without and with intention to act. Understanding these relationships may improve suicide risk assessment and inform personalized interventions, potentially reducing the transition from ideation to action. Trauma-focused approaches addressing emotional abuse may be especially relevant for individuals at high risk.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":63,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
