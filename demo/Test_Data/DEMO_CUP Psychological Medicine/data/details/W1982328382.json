Empirical evidence indicates that manipulations of attention may facilitate changes in cognition and stress symptoms in emotional disorder. Methods. The present study reports the effects of Attention Training (ATT) in a brief case series of three patients with primary hypochondriasis using an A–B–A design. Results. ATT produced clinically significant improvements in self-reported measures of affect, and illness-related behaviour and cognition. Treatment gains were maintained at 6 months follow-up assessments. Measures of body-focused attention indicated that the ATT procedure acted on attentional processes as intended. Conclusions. The present case series extends the effects of ATT to problems of hypochondriasis. A number of studies now suggest that ATT is associated with a reduction in anxiety and negative beliefs across disorders of panic, social phobia and hypochondriasis. Controlled clinical trials are now required to establish firmly the effects of ATT as a component of cognitive therapy.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":136},"references":10,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
