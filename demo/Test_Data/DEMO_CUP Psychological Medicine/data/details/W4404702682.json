Aggression represents a salient risk factor for suicide among civilians, yet is relatively understudied among military populations. Although several theories posit a relation between aggression and suicide with putative underlying mechanisms of social isolation, access to firearms, and alcohol use, researchers have yet to test these potential mediators. This study uses rich, longitudinal data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience (STARRS) Pre/Post Deployment Study (PPDS) to examine whether aggression longitudinally predicts suicide attempts and to identify mediators of this association. Methods Army soldiers ( N = 8483) completed assessments 1 month prior to deployment and 1, 2–3, and 9–12 months post-deployment. Participants reported on their physical and verbal aggression, suicide attempts, social network size, firearm ownership, and frequency of alcohol use. Results As expected, pre-deployment aggression was significantly associated with suicide attempts at 12-months post-deployment even after controlling for lifetime suicide attempts. Social network size and alcohol use frequency mediated this association, but firearm ownership did not. Conclusions Findings further implicate aggression as an important suicide risk factor among military personnel and suggest that social isolation and alcohol use may partially account for this association.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":50,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
