A first injection did seem to give rise to a very slight short-lasting effect, though this could not be ascertained clearly. There were no visible effects after a second injection. The thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) response curve after TRH administration in the depressive patients group was blunted in comparison with that in a matched control group of normals.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":23},"references":30,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
