The ESN response to oestrogen challenge was delayed in 10 AD patients compared with 7 age-matched controls. Reduced basal and oestrogen stimulated plasma ESN may be related to impaired responsiveness of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial neurons and/or a reduction in the amount of pituitary ESN available for release. Plasma ESN measurements may be of value for excluding the diagnosis of AD in patients with dementia who present before the age of 65.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":16,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
