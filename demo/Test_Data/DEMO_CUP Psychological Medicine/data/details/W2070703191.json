About a fifth of them were found to exhibit ‘school refusal’; a third showed ‘truancy’; less than a sixth exhibited both ‘school refusal’ and ‘truancy’ combined; and over a third had the characteristics of neither condition. Differences between these categories were found in manifestations of psychiatric disturbance and in responsiveness to a court adjournment procedure.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":35},"references":18,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
