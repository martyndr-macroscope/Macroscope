Fifty-six subjects (19%) were found to be persistent somatizers, i.e. they were admitted repeatedly to general hospitals for physical symptoms without an organic basis. This corresponded to a frequency of persistent somatization in the population 0·6 per 1000 men and 3·2 per 1000 women.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":218},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
