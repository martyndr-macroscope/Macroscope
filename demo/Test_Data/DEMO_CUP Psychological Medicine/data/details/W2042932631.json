However, this important principle has been carried through incompletely, to the disadvantage of diagnostic flexibility and innovation. In addition, too much work is required for the retrieval of cases with the same aetiology irerspective of the syndromes they exhibit, or of cases with the same syndrome whether in the setting of a personality disorder, a neurosis, or a psychosis. The present paper suggests certain simplifications by which the principle of combined classification can hopefully be applied to develop a more comprehensive and flexible instrument.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":52},"references":10,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
