Other analgesic abusers without renal impairment also showed these traits, while controls with renal disease not due to analgesie abuse were significantly less introverted and neurotic. It is suggested that these personality traits predisposed the patients to analgesie abuse and therefore to renal damage.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":16},"references":26,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
