The patients had recent onset emotional disorders of poor prognosis. Patients in the problem-solving group showed significantly greater reductions in symptoms. Problem-solving as given by a psychiatrist was feasible in primary care and acceptable to patients. Problem-solving is now being evaluated as given by general practitioners trained in the method.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":112},"references":11,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
