In the present study the parental social class, the current social class and the social mobility has been compared in 2,861 male referrals to the psychiatric services in North-Eastern Scotland and 1,487 men randomly selected from the local population. Within the psychiatric sample similar comparisons have been made between diagnostic groups. In all three aspects of social class considered decade of birth was shown to be an important variable.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":47},"references":17,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
