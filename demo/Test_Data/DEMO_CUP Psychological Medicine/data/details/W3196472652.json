This study aimed to provide an estimate of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving functioning in early psychosis. We also sought evidence of superiority between intervention approaches. Methods An electronic search was conducted using PubMed and PsycINFO to identify original articles reporting on trials of psychosocial interventions in early-stage psychosis, published up to December 2020 and is reported following PRISMA guidelines. Data were extracted on validated measures of functioning from included studies and pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) was estimated. Results In total, 31 studies involving 2811 participants were included, focusing on: cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp), family-based therapy, supported employment, cognitive remediation training (CRT) and multi-component psychosocial interventions. Across interventions, improved function was observed (SMD = 0.239; 95% confidence interval 0.115–0.364, p &lt; 0.001). Effect sizes varied by intervention type, stage of illness, length and duration of treatment and outcome measure used. In particular, interventions based on CRT significantly outperformed symptom-focused CBT interventions, while multi-component interventions were associated with largest gains. Conclusions Psychosocial interventions, particularly when provided as part of a multi-component intervention model and delivered in community-based settings are associated with significant improvements in social and occupational function. This review underscores the value of sensitively tracking and targeting psychosocial function as part of the standard provided by early intervention services.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":43},"references":62,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
