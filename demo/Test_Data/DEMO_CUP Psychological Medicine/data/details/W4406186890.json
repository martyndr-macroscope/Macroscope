This study aimed to identify the neurophysiologic basis underlying the association between visual WM and auditory processing function in children with ADHD. Methods The participants included 86 children with ADHD (aged 6–15 years, mean age 9.66 years, 70 boys, and 16 girls) and 90 typically developing (TD) children (aged 7–16 years, mean age 10.30 years, 66 boys, and 24 girls). Electroencephalograms were recorded from all participants while they performed an auditory discrimination task (oddball task). The visual WM capacity and ADHD symptom severity were measured for all participants. Results Compared with TD children, children with ADHD presented a poorer visual WM capacity and a smaller mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude. Notably, the smaller MMN amplitude in children with ADHD predicted a less impaired WM capacity and milder inattention symptom severity. In contrast, the larger MMN amplitude in TD children predicted a better visual WM capacity. Conclusions Our results suggest an intimate relationship and potential shared mechanism between visual WM and auditory processing function. We liken this shared mechanism to a total cognitive resource limit that varies between groups of children, which could drive correlated individual differences in auditory processing function and visual WM. Our findings provide a neurophysiological correlate for reports of WM deficits in ADHD patients and indicate potential effective markers for clinical intervention.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":63,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
