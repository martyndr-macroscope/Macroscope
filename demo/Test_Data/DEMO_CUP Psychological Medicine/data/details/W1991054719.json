Negative symptoms may also be related to dopamine dysregulation, with the precise mixture of positive and negative symptoms depending on the relative degree of dopamine dysregulation in particular mesocorticolimbic circuits. Evidence for this model is examined, and predictions arising from this model are described.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":28},"references":69,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
