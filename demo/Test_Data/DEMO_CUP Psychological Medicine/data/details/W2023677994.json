In the subjects with diabetic autonomic neuropathy, the spontaneous variability and stress-induced reactivity of the heart rate as well as the number of tachycardic episodes were reduced, whereas the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles was somewhat increased. Impaired heartbeat perception and a complete loss of perception of arrhythmias as a consequence of neuropathic deafferentation could be demonstrated. Cardiac perception disorders also play a vital role in other clinical problems, e.g. silent myocardial infarction and lack of awareness of hypoglycaemia in diabetes mellitus.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":35},"references":39,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
