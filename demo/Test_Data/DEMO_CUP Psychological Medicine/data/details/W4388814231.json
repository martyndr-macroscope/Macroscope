Methods We included individuals aged 19–62 with GD between 2005 and 2018 ( n = 2830; 71.1% men, mean age: 35.1) and a matched comparison cohort ( n = 28 300). Work disability was operationalized as the aggregated net days of sickness absence and disability pension. Generalized estimating equation models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of long-term work disability (&gt;90 days of work disability/year). Secondly, we conducted Group-based Trajectory Models on days of work disability. Results Individuals with GD showed a four-year increased risk of long-term work disability compared to the matched cohort, peaking at the time of diagnosis (AOR = 1.89; CI 1.67–2.13). Four trajectory groups of work disability days were identified: constant low (60.3%, 5.6–11.2 days), low and increasing (11.4%, 11.8–152.5 days), medium–high and decreasing (11.1%, 65.1–110 days), and constant high (17.1%, 264–331 days). Individuals who were females, older, with prior psychiatric diagnosis, and had been dispensed a psychotropic medication, particularly antidepressants, were more likely to be assigned to groups other than the constant low . Conclusion Individuals with GD have an increased risk of work disability which may add financial and social pressure and is an additional incentive for earlier detection and prevention of GD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":8},"references":50,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
