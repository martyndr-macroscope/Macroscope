This study examined the variation in its psychological impact across the first four waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Methods Transcripts from Open Up, an online text-based counseling service, between January 2019 and January 2021 were analyzed ( N = 60 775). We identified COVID-19 mentioned sessions using keywords and further categorized them into those that also mentioned symptoms of common mental disorders (CMDs) and those that did not. Autoregressive integrated moving average models were used to analyze the associations between the severity of the outbreak and the mention of COVID-19 and CMDs. Results Results revealed that the pandemic led to increased psychological distress. Compared to prior to its advent, more people sought help in the initial months of the outbreak. Furthermore, associations were found between the severity of the outbreak and the number of help-seeker mentioning the pandemic, as well as between the outbreak severity and the number of help-seekers disclosing psychological distress. However, these relationships were not uniform across the four waves of outbreaks; a dissociation between outbreak severity and help-seekers' concern was found in the fourth wave. Conclusion As the pandemic waxes and wanes, people may become habituated to its psychological toll. This may be interpreted as a form of resilience. Instead of worsening with time, the psychological impact of COVID-19 may reduce with repeated exposure.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":11},"references":47,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
