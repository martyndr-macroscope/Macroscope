Hence, comparisons of adverse event rates across medications are an essential component of clinical decision-making. We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies ( n = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13–83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00–75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96–27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68–7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another. This might improve treatment acceptability and compliance.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":15},"references":45,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
