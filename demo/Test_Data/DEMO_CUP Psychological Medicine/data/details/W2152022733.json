The mailing included the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) and the Crown—Crisp Experiential Index (CCEI). There was a 70% response rate and 411 usable questionnaires were returned. Twenty-eight respondents (6·8%) produced EAT scores of 30 or more. One case of anorexia nervosa and one of bulimia were identified. Interviews of high EAT scoring subjects revealed several subjects with partial syndromes which failed to fulfil diagnostic criteria for either clinical eating disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":67},"references":17,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
