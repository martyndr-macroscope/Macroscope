Lithium was fed to rats and no change in erythrocyte Na-K ATPase was shown. These findings contrast with studies of lithium in manic depressive psychosis. The fluctuations in the erythrocyte membrane cation carrier were studied in 5 normal subjects over 12 weeks and the correlations between the parameters calculated. The erythrocyte sodium concentration correlated positively with the ouabain sensitive potassium influx. This too contrasts with findings in manic depressive psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":29},"references":18,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
