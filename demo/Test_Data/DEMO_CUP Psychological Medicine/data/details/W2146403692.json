However, it is unknown whether depression is a functional consequence of OCD or whether these disorders share a common genetic aetiology. This longitudinal twin study compared these two hypotheses. Method Data were drawn from a longitudinal sample of adolescent twins and siblings ( n = 2651; Genesis 12–19 study) and from a cross-sectional sample of adult twins ( n = 4920). The longitudinal phenotypic associations between OCD symptoms (OCS) and depressive symptoms were examined using a cross-lag model. Multivariate twin analyses were performed to explore the genetic and environmental contributions to the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between OCS and depressive symptoms. Results In the longitudinal phenotypic analyses, OCS at time 1 (wave 2 of the Genesis 12–19 study) predicted depressive symptoms at time 2 (wave 3 of the Genesis 12–19 study) to a similar extent to which depressive symptoms at time 1 predicted OCS at time 2. Cross-sectional twin analyses in both samples indicated that common genetic factors explained 52–65% of the phenotypic correlation between OCS and depressive symptoms. The proportion of the phenotypic correlation due to common non-shared environmental factors was considerably smaller (35%). In the adolescent sample, the longitudinal association between OCS at time 1 and subsequent depressive symptoms was accounted for by the genetic association between OCS and depressive symptoms at time 1. There was no significant environmental association between OCS and later depressive symptoms. Conclusions The present findings show that OCS and depressive symptoms co-occur primarily due to shared genetic factors and suggest that genetic, rather than environmental, effects account for the longitudinal relationship between OCS and depressive symptoms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":42},"references":58,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
