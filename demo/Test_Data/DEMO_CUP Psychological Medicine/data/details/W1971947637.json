Dementia diagnoses were made by both a clinician and a research interview using a computer algorithm to meet DSM-III-R and ICD-10 (Draft) criteria. The IQCODE was found to perform at least as well as the MMSE against all diagnoses and significantly better when judged against the algorithmic ICD-10 diagnoses. Also, the IQCODE was found to be uncontaminated by pre-morbid ability as estimated from the National Adult Reading Test and to have very high test–retest reliability after a delay of a day or more.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":323},"references":5,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
