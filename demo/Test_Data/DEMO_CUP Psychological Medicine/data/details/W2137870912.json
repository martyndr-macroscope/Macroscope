Nevertheless, the usefulness of the intermediate phenotypes (‘endo’ phenotypes) continues to be debated energetically. We argue that, while not all intermediate phenotypes are created equal, the hypothesis-driven investigation of the translational cascades linking genetic variation to disturbed behavior is a viable and important strategy that should not be supplanted by an exclusive focus on brainless, clinical/categorical phenotypes investigated in very large numbers of participants.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":39},"references":47,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
