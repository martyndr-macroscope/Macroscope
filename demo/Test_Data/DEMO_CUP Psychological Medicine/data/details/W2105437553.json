The clinical significance of an effect size at this level was found to be so poor that these meta-analyses have subscribed to the myth of an exclusively placebo-like effect of second-generation antidepressants. A re-allocation of HAMD items focusing on those items measuring severity of clinical depression, the HAMD 6 , has identified effect sizes of ⩾0.40 for second-generation antidepressants in placebo-controlled trials for which even a dose–response relationship can be demonstrated. In the relapse-prevention phase during continuation therapy of patients with major depression, the advantage of second-generation antidepressants over placebo was as significant as in the acute therapy phase. To explore a myth is not to deny the facts but rather to re-allocate them.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":59},"references":55,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
