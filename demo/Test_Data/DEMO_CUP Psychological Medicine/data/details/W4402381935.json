This systematic review summarizes the evidence of green space exposure for people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs), focusing on incidence and mental health outcomes, including mental health symptoms and health service use. The study was pre-registered (PROSPERO ID: CRD42023431954), and conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Seven databases, reference lists, and gray literature sources were searched. Methodological quality was assessed using The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. 126 studies were screened, and 12 studies were eligible for inclusion. Seven studies found that exposure to green space was associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia (lowest to highest green space exposure: HRs = 0.62–0.37; IRRs = 1.52–1.18), with five studies reporting a dose-response relationship. Of these studies, four examined childhood exposure and the remainder examined adult exposure. Regarding health service use, proximity to green space was not significantly associated with length of hospital admission, though greater green space exposure was associated with reduced hospital admission rates. Three studies found reduced symptoms of anxiety ( d = −0.70–2.42), depression ( d = −0.97–1.70) and psychosis ( d = −0.94) with greater green space exposure. Exposure to green space reduces the risk of schizophrenia, and there is emerging evidence of the potential benefits of green space for reducing symptoms and health service use among people with SSDs. Future research using experimental and longitudinal designs will provide more robust evidence of the benefits of green space for people with SSDs.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":8},"references":46,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
