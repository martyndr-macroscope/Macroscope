An anti-anxiety drug is used (diazepam), the blood level declining during each treatment session and the starting dose for each treatment session being gradually reduced. Some relevant animal work on state-dependent learaing in the drugged-state is briefly reviewed. Despite the multiplicity of other treatments available this method would appear to have some advantages.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":11,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
