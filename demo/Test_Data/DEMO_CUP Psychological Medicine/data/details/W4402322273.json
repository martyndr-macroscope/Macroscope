While this developmental stage is marked by substantial maturation of the neural circuity involved in threat learning, research directly examining adolescence-specific patterns of neural responding during threat learning is scarce. This study compared adolescents and adults in acquisition and extinction of conditioned threat responses assessed at the cognitive, psychophysiological, and neural levels, focusing on the late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential (ERP) component indexing emotional valence. Method Sixty-five adults and 63 adolescents completed threat acquisition and extinction, 24 h apart, using the bell conditioning paradigm. Self-reported fear, skin conductance responses (SCR), and ERPs were measured. Results Developmental differences emerged in neural and psychophysiological responses during threat acquisition, with adolescents displaying heightened LPP responses to threat and safety cues as well as heightened threat-specific SCR compared to adults. During extinction, SCR suggested comparable reduction in conditioned threat responses across groups, while LPP revealed incomplete extinction only among adolescents. Finally, age moderated the link between anxiety severity and LPP-assessed extinction, whereby greater anxiety severity was associated with reduced extinction among younger participants. Conclusions In line with developmental theories, adolescence is characterized by a specific age-related difficulty adapting to diminishing emotional significance of prior threats, contributing to heightened vulnerability to anxiety symptoms. Further, LPP appears to be sensitive to developmental differences in threat learning and may thus potentially serve as a useful biomarker in research on adolescents, threat learning, and anxiety.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":57,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
