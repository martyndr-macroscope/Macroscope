Negative symptoms are prominent among individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis (i.e. those with prodromal syndromes) and highly predictive of conversion to illness. Mechanisms underlying negative symptoms in the CHR population are unclear. Two studies were conducted to evaluate whether abnormalities in a reward processing mechanism thought to be core to negative symptoms in SZ, value representation, also exist in CHR individuals and whether they are associated with negative symptoms transphasically. Methods Study 1 included 33 individuals in the chronic phase of illness who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ) and 40 healthy controls (CN). Study 2 included 37 CHR participants and 45 CN. In both studies, participants completed the delay discounting (DD) task as a measure of value representation and the Brief Negative Symptom Scale was rated to measure negative symptoms. Results Results indicated that patients with SZ had steeper discounting rates than CN, indicating impairments in value representation. However, CHR participants were unimpaired on the DD task. In both studies, steeper discounting was associated with greater severity of negative symptoms. Conclusions These findings suggest that deficits in value representation are associated with negative symptoms transphasically.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":26},"references":78,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
