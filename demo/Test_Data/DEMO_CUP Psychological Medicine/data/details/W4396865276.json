Different changes in EEG microstates can be observed in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BD). However, the similarities and disparatenesses in whole-brain dynamics on a subsecond timescale among individuals diagnosed with SCZ, BD, and MDD are unclear. Methods This study included 1112 participants (380 individuals diagnosed with SCZ, 330 with BD, 212 with MDD, and 190 demographically matched healthy controls [HCs]). We assembled resting-state EEG data and completed a microstate analysis of all participants using a cross-sectional design. Results Our research indicates that SCZ, BD, and MDD exhibit distinct patterns of transition among the four EEG microstate states (A, B, C, and D). The analysis of transition probabilities showed a higher frequency of switching from microstates A to B and from B to A in each patient group compared to the HC group, and less frequent transitions from microstates A to C and from C to A in the SCZ and MDD groups compared to the HC group. And the probability of the microstate switching from C to D and D to C in the SCZ group significantly increased compared to those in the patient and HC groups. Conclusions Our findings provide crucial insights into the abnormalities involved in distributing neural assets and enabling proper transitions between different microstates in patients with major psychiatric disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":12},"references":46,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
