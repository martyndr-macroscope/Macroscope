This study employs two psychopathology network approaches to identify which post-traumatic symptoms are related to PLEs in a sample of late adolescents. We propose that cPTSD symptoms play a crucial role in explaining the co-occurrence of trauma and PLEs. Methods A sample of 1010 late adolescents provided measures of post-traumatic symptomatology and PLEs. We estimated the Gaussian graphical network structure of PTSD/cPTSD symptoms and PLEs and assessed their bridge centrality indices. Bayesian network analysis was then used to estimate a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Gender was set as a moderator in both Gaussian and Bayesian models. Results Results show that affect dysregulation, a cPTSD domain, presented the highest bridge connection with the PLE cluster. Bayesian network analysis identified a pathway going from cPTSD items of worthlessness and relational dysregulation, to PLE items of paranoia and social anxiety. Additionally, we found relevant gender differences in network connectivity, with females showing higher connectivity compared to males. Conclusions Our findings highlight the central role of affect dysregulation and negative self-concept in linking cPTSD to PLE symptoms, with specific differences according to gender. These insights underscore the need for targeted, gender-sensitive approaches in the prevention and treatment of PLEs among adolescents, emphasizing early intervention and tailored treatment strategies.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":2},"references":101,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
