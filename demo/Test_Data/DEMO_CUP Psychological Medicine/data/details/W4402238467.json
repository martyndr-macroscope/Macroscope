VR has shown good acceptability and promise in different mental health conditions. No systematic review has evaluated the use of VR in Bipolar Disorder (BD). This PRISMA-compliant systematic review searched PubMed and Web of Science databases (PROSPERO: CRD42023467737) to identify studies conducted in individuals with BD in which VR was used. Results were systematically synthesized around four categories (cognitive and functional evaluation, clinical assessment, response to VR and safety/acceptability). Eleven studies were included (267 individuals, mean age = 36.6 years, 60.7% females). Six studies using VR to carry out a cognitive evaluation detected impairments in neuropsychological performance and delayed reaction times. VR was used to assess emotional regulation. No differences in well-being between VR-based and physical calm rooms were found. A VR-based stress management program reduced subjective stress, depression, and anxiety levels. VR-based cognitive remediation improved cognition, depressive symptoms, and emotional awareness. 48.7% of the individuals with BD considered VR-based cognitive remediation ‘excellent’, whereas 28.2% considered it ‘great’. 87.2% of individuals did not report any side effects. 81.8% of studies received a global quality rating of moderate. Emerging data point towards a promising use of VR in BD as an acceptable assessment/intervention tool. However, multiple unstudied domains as comorbidity, relapse and prodromal symptoms should be investigated. Research on children and adolescents is also recommended. Further research and replication of findings are required to disentangle which VR-interventions for which populations and outcomes are effective.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":45,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
