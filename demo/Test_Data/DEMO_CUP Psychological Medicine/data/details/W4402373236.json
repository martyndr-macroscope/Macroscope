However, observational study designs cannot distinguish causal effects from confounding. Methods First, we conducted Mendelian randomisation (MR) using genetic instruments for vitamin-D and DHA identified in independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Outcomes were (1) GWAS for traits related to autism and ADHD, generated in the Norwegian mother, father, and child cohort study (MoBa) from 3 to 8 years, (2) autism and ADHD diagnoses. Second, we used mother–father–child trio-MR in MoBa (1) to test causal effects through maternal nutrient levels, (2) to test effects of child nutrient levels, and (3) as a paternal negative control. Results Associations between higher maternal vitamin-D levels on lower ADHD related traits at age 5 did not remain after controlling for familial genetic predisposition using trio-MR. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for causal maternal effects of vitamin-D/DHA levels on other offspring traits or diagnoses. In the reverse direction, there was evidence for a causal effect of autism genetic predisposition on lower vitamin-D levels and of ADHD genetic predisposition on lower DHA levels. Conclusions Triangulating across study designs, we did not find evidence for maternal effects. We add to a growing body of evidence that suggests that previous observational associations are likely biased by genetic confounding. Consequently, maternal supplementation is unlikely to influence these offspring neurodevelopmental traits. Notably, genetic predisposition to ADHD and autism was associated with lower DHA and vitamin-D levels respectively, suggesting previous associations might have been due to reverse causation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":48,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
