Previous research has indicated aberrant levels of inflammatory markers and growth factors in AN, which in other populations have been shown to influence hippocampal integrity. Methods Here we investigated the influence of concentrations of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF- α ] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on the whole hippocampal volume, as well as the volumes of three regions (the hippocampal body, head, and tail) and 18 subfields bilaterally. Investigations occurred both cross-sectionally between acutely underweight adolescent/young adult females with AN (acAN; n = 82) and people recovered from AN (recAN; n = 20), each independently pairwise age-matched with healthy controls (HC), and longitudinally in acAN after partial renourishment ( n = 58). Hippocampal subfield volumes were quantified using FreeSurfer. Concentrations of molecular factors were analyzed in linear models with hippocampal (subfield) volumes as the dependent variable. Results Cross-sectionally, there was no evidence for an association between IL-6, TNF- α , or BDNF and between-group differences in hippocampal subfield volumes. Longitudinally, increasing concentrations of BDNF were positively associated with longitudinal increases in bilateral global hippocampal volumes after controlling for age, age 2 , estimated total intracranial volume, and increases in body mass index (BMI). Conclusions These findings suggest that increases in BDNF may contribute to global hippocampal recovery over and above increases in BMI during renourishment. Investigations into treatments targeted toward increasing BDNF in AN may be warranted.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":11},"references":75,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
