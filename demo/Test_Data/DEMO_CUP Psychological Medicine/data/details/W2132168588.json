Comparisons of admissions to mental illness hospitals and DGHUs indicate no major differences in most categories of patient characteristics (age, sex, order of admission and diagnosis); where differences do exist, they appear to be decreasing. Concern that DGHUs might ‘cream off’ patients with less serious illnesses, with a resultant ‘two-tier’ system of mental hospital care, would thus appear to be unwarranted.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":4,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
