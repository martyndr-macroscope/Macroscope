Key questions concern the extent of these links between pubertal timing and adult symptoms, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Methods Longitudinal data were available for 475 female and 404 male participants. Pubertal timing was indicated by age at mid-puberty for both groups and age at menarche for female participants (both assessed continuously). Adult self-reported outcomes of recent and lifetime depression and anxiety were predicted from pubertal timing, also controlling for adolescent (then childhood) internalizing problems. Emerging adulthood self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, education level, and age at sexual initiation were examined as mediators of the pubertal timing-adult internalizing link. Multilevel models tested hypotheses. Results Pubertal timing had persisting and sex-dependent psychological associations. Specifically, in female, but not male, adults, early puberty was associated with all adult internalizing outcomes, and for past year and lifetime depression symptoms, even after controlling for adolescent internalizing problems. Pubertal timing links with past-year depression symptoms were mediated by age at sexual initiation, while all other persisting pubertal timing links with adult symptoms were mediated by body dissatisfaction. Most findings concerning depression held when childhood internalizing problems were also a covariate. Conclusions Leveraging data spanning four developmental periods, findings highlight the associations between pubertal variations and adult internalizing symptoms by revealing underlying sex-dependent behavioral pathways. Only for female participants did pubertal timing affect depression and anxiety in established adulthood, with body dissatisfaction and age at sexual initiation as unique developmental mechanisms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":66,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
