A representative sample from Hannover, FRG, including 278 first admission DSM-III schizophrenics, were followed for three years. Findings demonstrated that schizophrenic women experience fewer rehospitalizations, shorter lengths of stay, and survive longer in the community than schizophrenic men. Implications of the role of gender for schizophrenia are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":121},"references":110,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
