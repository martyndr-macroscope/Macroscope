On this basis it seems that Schreber suffered from a severe major psychotic depressive disorder with tendencies towards bipolarity for the period in question. A more global, non-systematic RDC-oriented interpretation is then offered for the remaining course of the illness until Schreber's death in 1911.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":8},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
