Of the 82·5% of all events collected which were covered by the inventory, 12 of the 67 event categories accounted for 77% of life events with an aetiologicaly significant rating of marked or moderate long-term threat. Where practical and economic constraints oblige research workers to choose the inventory method, a brief list of event categories, such as the List of Threatening Experiences, is recommended in preference to much longer lists.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":52,"cited_by_count":1088},"references":21,"networkCitations":52,"seed":false}
