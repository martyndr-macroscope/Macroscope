A new method is described in which the covariation of resistance and interference is represented in the form of a matrix. The results, using this method, can give a unique picture of the quality of the patient's symptoms from the clinical standpoint and provide useful guidelines for treatment and follow up. Automatic data-processing is offered for the convenience of clinicians and researchers wishing to utilize the test in this form.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":12},"references":8,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
