Attentional difficulties may be associated with duration of illness. Method Female participants with AN (restricting subtype; n =24) and healthy comparison women ( n =24) were randomly allocated to subliminal or supraliminal exposure to visual stimuli (food, neutral and aversive images) while performing the 1-back and 2-back working-memory tasks. Results Participants with AN made fewer errors than the healthy comparison group in the subliminal condition but significantly more errors in the supraliminal condition [condition×group interaction, F (1, 44)=6.82, p &lt;0.01]: this was irrespective of stimulus type (food, neutral and aversive) and task (1-back or 2-back). The total number of errors made correlated positively with the duration of the AN for both the 1-back task ( r s =0.46, p &lt;0.05) and for the 2-back task ( r s =0.53, p &lt;0.01). Conclusions Decreased ability to concentrate in the presence of explicit distracters is a feature of AN and is associated with longer duration of illness. This phenomenon could be addressed in psychological interventions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":41},"references":62,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
