In this study, we tested the hypothesis that low smooth pursuit gain in schizophrenia is related to an abnormality in motion perception. Methods . The subjects were 19 schizophrenics treated with clozapine and 19 controls. In addition to smooth pursuit and motion perception paradigms, sustained attention was also assessed using a continuous performance task (CPT). Results . In the patient group, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between smooth pursuit gain and motion perception threshold ( r =−0·60, P &lt;0·01). This relationship was not secondary to attention deficits as assessed by the CPT. Conclusions . Our results are consistent with the notion that the smooth pursuit gain deficit is related to a deficit in motion perception rather than in attention. Brain area V5 (also referred to as ‘MT’ in macaque), located in the parieto-occipital region, is known to be critically important both for motion perception and gain. Thus, our results point to an abnormality in this area in schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":125},"references":27,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
