Mentalizing deficits have been prominently linked to aberrant activity in cortical regions considered to be part of the “social brain network” (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction), yet emerging evidence also suggests the importance of cerebellar dysfunction. In the present study—using a transdiagnostic, clinical psychiatric sample spanning the psychosis-autism-social anxiety spectrums—we examined the role of the cerebellum in mentalizing and its unique contributions to broader social functioning. Methods Sixty-two participants (38 with significant social dysfunction secondary to psychiatric illness and 24 nonclinical controls without social dysfunction) completed a mentalizing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. General linear model analysis, latent variable modeling, and regression analyses were used to examine the contribution of cerebellum activation to the prediction of group status and social functioning. Results Mentalizing activated a broad set of social cognitive brain regions, including cerebral mentalizing network (MN) nodes and posterior cerebellum. Higher posterior cerebellum activation significantly predicted clinical status (i.e., individuals with psychiatric disorders versus nonclinical controls). Finally, cerebellar activation accounted for significant variance in social functioning independent of all other cerebral MN brain regions identified in a whole-brain analysis. Conclusions Findings add to an accumulating body of evidence establishing the unique role of the posterior cerebellum in mentalizing deficits and social dysfunction across psychiatric illnesses. Collectively, our results suggest that the posterior cerebellum should be considered – alongside established cerebral regions – as part of the mentalizing network.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":58,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
