These changes, which would be expected to lead to an increase in tryptophan influx into the brain, and hence to an increase in cerebral serotonin synthesis, could be related to the clinical effects of drug withdrawal.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
