There were three general objectives: first, to provide a specialized state-wide clinical service for the assessment and management of those with affective disorders, particularly treatment-resistant depression; secondly, to make a research contribution; and thirdly, to serve as an academic centre for teaching and training of undergraduate and postgraduate students from a variety of disciplines.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":3},"references":57,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
