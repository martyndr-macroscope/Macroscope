But little has been done to compare the past or the present under different jurisdictions. This paper, therefore, suggests some points which would encourage such comparisons, and particularly a comparison between France and England in the nineteenth century, for both of which countries there is now a valuable historical literature. It also illustrates the complex interaction of procedure and medical expertise by reference to the case of George Victor Townley (1863).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":40,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
