Prisoners of war had significantly more anxiety and depressive ‘neuroses’ and more major affective illness, although the latter finding was not statistically significant. The two groups did not differ in the risk of alcohol abuse and dependence.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":42},"references":15,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
