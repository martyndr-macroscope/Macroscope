Dependencies between components decomposed by some ICA algorithm are calculated using test statistics, based on the empirical characteristic function. This method helps selecting the com-bination of independent components by classifying them into subgroups. The relevance of these ideas is illustrated with synthesized data and auditory evoked MEG, and com-pared with the separability matrix method. 1.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":3},"references":6,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
