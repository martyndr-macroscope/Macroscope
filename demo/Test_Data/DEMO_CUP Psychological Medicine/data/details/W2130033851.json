A feature of this survey was that each patient took part in a standard social interaction test, and their performance was assessed by two psychologists. A relatively high proportion of patients, one in six on the most conservative estimate, and probably over one in four, were judged by psychologists and psychiatrists to be socially inadequate, and the results showed a clear pattern of behavioural, social and personality factors associated with these judgements. Implications for assessment and treatment are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":43},"references":24,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
