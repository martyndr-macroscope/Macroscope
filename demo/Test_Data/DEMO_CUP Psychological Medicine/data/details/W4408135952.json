There is a need to examine their prevalence over long-term follow-up after first-episode psychosis (FEP) and determine their early predictors. Methods Of 510 participants with FEP evaluated on 26 risk factors for later outcomes, 260 were reassessed after 21 years of follow-up for lifetime ratings of most severe suicidal ideation, number of suicide attempts, and lethality of the most severe attempt. Risk factors and STB outcomes were modeled using hierarchical linear regression analysis. Results Over the 21-year follow-up period, 62.7% of participants experienced suicidal thoughts, 40.8% attempted suicide, and 18 died of suicide (3.5% case fatality and 20.6% proportionate mortality). Suicidal ideation was independently predicted by parental socioeconomic status, familial load of major depression, neurodevelopmental delay, poor adolescence social networks, and suicidal thoughts/behavior at FEP. The number of suicide attempts was independently predicted by years of follow-up, familial load of major depression, obstetric complications, childhood adversity, and suicidal thoughts/behavior at FEP. Lethality was independently predicted by familial load of major depression, male sex, neurodevelopmental delay, and poor adolescence social networks. The proportion of variance in suicidal ideation, attempts, and lethality explained by the independent predictors was 29.3%, 21.2%, and 18.1%, respectively. Conclusions STBs are highly prevalent in psychotic disorders and leads to substantial morbidity and mortality. They were predicted by a number of early risk factors, whose clinical recognition should contribute to improved prediction and prevention in people with psychotic disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":1},"references":44,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
