The ICD-10 classification yielded a higher proportion (50%) of personality disordered patients than the Personality Assessment Schedule (34%) and those from ethnic minorities (mainly Afro-Caribbean) and upper social classes had a lower incidence of personality disorder. Social networks were smaller in personality disordered patients and there were fewer attachment figures. Improvement in social function, and to a lesser extent with depressive symptomatology, was better in patients with no personality disorder referred to the community service compared with the hospital service. No differences were found between the numbers and duration of social contacts in the two services and it is concluded that the better outcome in the community-treated patients was independent of changes in social networks.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":67},"references":37,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
