This challenge may, in part, stem from the intertwined state (current symptoms; variable) and trait (general propensity; stable) experiences of depression. Here, we sought to disentangle state from trait experiences of depression by leveraging a longitudinal cohort and stratifying individuals into four groups: those in remission (‘trait depression group’), those with large longitudinal severity changes in depression symptomatology (‘state depression group’), and their respective matched control groups (total analytic n = 1030). We hypothesized that spatial network organization would be linked to trait depression due to its temporal stability, whereas functional connectivity between networks would be more sensitive to state-dependent depression symptoms due to its capacity to fluctuate. We identified 15 large-scale probabilistic functional networks from resting-state fMRI data and performed group comparisons on the amplitude, connectivity, and spatial overlap between these networks, using matched control participants as reference. Our findings revealed higher amplitude in visual networks for the trait depression group at the time of remission, in contrast to controls. This observation may suggest altered visual processing in individuals predisposed to developing depression over time. No significant group differences were observed in any other network measures for the trait-control comparison, nor in any measures for the state-control comparison. These results underscore the overlooked contribution of visual networks to the psychopathology of depression and provide evidence for distinct neural correlates between state and trait experiences of depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":105,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
