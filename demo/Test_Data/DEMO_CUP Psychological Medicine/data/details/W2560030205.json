However, most treatments for depression do not specifically target cognition. Neurocognitive deficits such as memory and concentration problems tend to persist after mood symptoms recover. Improving cognition in depression requires a better understanding of brain systems implicated in depression. A comprehensive approach is warranted for refined methods of assessing and treating cognitive dysfunction in depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":95},"references":27,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
