However, it is unclear whether these neural functions are similarly impaired in other disorders with psychotic symptomatology or individuals with genetic liability for psychosis. If abnormalities in reward sensitive brain areas are shared across individuals with psychotic psychopathology and people with heightened genetic liability for psychosis, there may be a common neural basis for symptoms of diminished pleasure and motivation. Methods We compared performance and neural activity in 123 people with a history of psychosis (PwP), 81 of their first-degree biological relatives, and 49 controls during a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task during fMRI. Results PwP exhibited hypoactivation of the striatum and anterior insula (AI) during cueing of potential future rewards with each diagnostic group showing hypoactivations during reward anticipation compared to controls. Despite normative task performance, relatives demonstrated caudate activation intermediate between controls and PwP, nucleus accumbens activation more similar to PwP than controls, but putamen activation on par with controls. Across diagnostic groups of PwP there was less functional connectivity between bilateral caudate and several regions of the salience network (medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, AI) during reward anticipation. Conclusions Findings implicate less activation and connectivity in reward processing brain regions across a spectrum of disorders involving psychotic psychopathology. Specifically, aberrations in striatal and insular activity during reward anticipation seen in schizophrenia are partially shared with other forms of psychotic psychopathology and associated with genetic liability for psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":4},"references":66,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
