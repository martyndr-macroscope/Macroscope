Working-class women were much more likely to develop depression because they experienced more of these factors. A new survey in a rural population in the Outer Hebrides has confirmed the importance of these factors in the genesis of depression, although provoking agents occurred much less frequently in this rural setting. However, integration into the traditional way of life, rather than a middle-class status, was related to a lower chance of developing depression, and this appears to be explained by the relationship of provoking agents and vulnerability factors to such integration in the Outer Hebrides, and to social class status in Camberwell.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":18,"cited_by_count":236},"references":25,"networkCitations":18,"seed":false}
