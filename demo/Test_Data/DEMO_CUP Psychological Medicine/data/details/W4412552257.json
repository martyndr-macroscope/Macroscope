The most common methods to improve cognition are facilitated computerized cognitive training with coaching and teaching cognitive self-management strategies. We compared these methods by dismantling the Thinking Skills for Work program, a comprehensive, validated cognitive remediation program that incorporates both strategies. Methods In a randomized controlled trial we assigned 203 unemployed people with serious mental illness in supported employment programs at two mental health agencies to receive either the full Thinking Skills for Work (TSW) program, which included computerized cognitive training (based on Cogpack software), or the program with cognitive self-management (CSM) but no computer training. Outcomes included employment, cognition, and mental health over 2 years. To benchmark outcomes, we also examined competitive work outcomes in a similar prior trial comparing the TSW program with supported employment only. Results The TSW and CSM groups improved significantly on all outcomes, but there were no differences between the groups. Competitive work outcomes for both groups resembled those of the TSW program in a prior trial and were better than the supported employment-only group in that study, suggesting that participants in both groups benefited from cognitive remediation. Conclusions Providing facilitated computerized cognitive training improved neither employment nor cognitive outcomes beyond teaching cognitive self-management strategies in people receiving supported employment. Computerized cognitive training may not be necessary for cognitive remediation programs to improve cognitive and functional outcomes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":75,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
