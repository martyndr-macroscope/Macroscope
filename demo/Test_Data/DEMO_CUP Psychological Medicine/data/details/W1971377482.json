Platelet aggregation and disaggregation following ADP was significantly lower in ‘acute-on-chronic’ schizophrenics (on drugs) compared with healthy controls, and disaggregation following 1 µM ADP was significantly less in drug-free schizophrenics. The difference between maximum aggregation induced by ADP and that induced by arachidonic acid was significantly greater in schizophrenics (both on drugs and drug-free) than in controls. These findings are related to possible abnormalities of central nervous system function in schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":6},"references":18,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
