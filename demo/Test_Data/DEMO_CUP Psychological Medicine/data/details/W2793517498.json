The effect of such experiences on cannabis use has not systematically been examined. Methods We undertook a mixed-methods online survey of 1231 cannabis users (including 926 continued users) using the Cannabis Experiences Questionnaire. We examined the effect of psychotic-like and pleasurable experiences on cessation of cannabis and intention to quit. Socio-demographic variables, cannabis use parameters and substance misuse history were included as covariates. Free-text data explored subjective reasons for changes in use. Results Cessation of cannabis use was associated with greater psychotic-like experiences [ p &lt; 0.001, Exp(B) 1.262, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.179–1.351], whilst continued cannabis users were more likely to report pleasurable experiences [ p &lt; 0.001, Exp(B) 0.717, 95% CI 0.662–0.776]. Intention to quit cannabis in continued users was associated with greater psychotic-like experiences [ p &lt; 0.003, Exp(B) 1.131, 95% CI 1.044–1.225], whilst intention to not quit was significantly associated with increased pleasurable experiences [ p &lt; 0.015, Exp(B) 0.892, 95% CI 0.814–0.978]. Whereas former users clearly ascribed cessation to negative experiences, continued users who expressed intention to quit less readily ascribed the intention to negative experiences. Conclusions Elucidation of psychotic-like experiences may form the basis of a therapeutic intervention for those who wish to quit. Cessation in those with cannabis-induced psychotomimetic experiences may offset the risk for the development of a psychotic disorder, in this higher risk group.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":23},"references":39,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
