Their progress was followed during live interviews, and also by their ratings of videotape interviews. Significant and consistent changes towards the standards of the teachers were demonstrated, as was a universal tendency to pass through a phase of rating at a higher level of abnormality than the standards they were trying to approach.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":17},"references":11,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
