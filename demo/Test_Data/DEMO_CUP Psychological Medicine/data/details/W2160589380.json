No significant differences between the groups were detected, apart from a visual retention deficit at 3 months in the prostacyclin group. The results cast doubt on previous findings suggesting that prostacyclin reduces cognitive deficits following open heart surgery.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
