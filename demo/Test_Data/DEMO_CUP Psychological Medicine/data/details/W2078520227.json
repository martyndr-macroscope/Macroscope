The results suggest that there may be a primary defect of temperature regulation in anorexia nervosa which is linked in some way with the feeding disorder characteristic of this illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":58},"references":38,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
