The probability of being a psychiatric case according to the Present State Examination is predicted from the total score on the General Health Questionnaire and from the general practitioner's judgement on the presence of a mental health problem. Subjects were 292 primary care attenders. Results are compared with those from prior studies. Next, the extension to the polytomous case is demonstrated. The probability of being at any given level of the Index of Definition (computed from PSE data) is estimated from the General Health Questionnaire total score by an ordered polytomous logistic regression model. Several applications of the polytomous logistic regression model are discussed. These range from estimating the proportion of psychiatric cases among individuals who refuse to be interviewed to the formulation of sampling schemes which can be expected to reduce costs while at the same time yielding optimal information for testing specific hypotheses.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":11},"references":25,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
