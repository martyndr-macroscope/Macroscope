CCK receptors were localized to subiculum and parahippocampal gyrus. In the cortical areas there was a particularly dense lamination of receptors. In the schizophrenic material a similar overall pattern was seen, but there were significant losses of receptors in CA1 subiculum and cortex. These findings confirm the distribution of CCK receptors in the retrohippocampal areas in man and also provide further support for earlier homogenate studies which have also shown a loss of CCK binding sites in schizophrenia. This effect was localized primarily to parahippocampal gyrus suggesting that CCK plays some role in the genesis of developmental abnormalities in this region.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":26},"references":24,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
