Explanations include being different manifestations of the same condition and simply sharing some symptoms. Method A matched case-control study in UK primary care, using data collected prospectively in the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). The main outcome measures were: health-care utilization, specific symptoms and diagnoses. Risk markers were divided into distant (from 3 years to 1 year before diagnosis) and recent (1 year before diagnosis). Results A total of 4388 patients with any fatigue syndrome were matched to two groups of patients: those attending for IBS and those attending for another reason. Infections were specific risk markers for both syndromes, with viral infections being a risk marker for a fatigue syndrome [odds ratios (ORs) 2.3–6.3], with a higher risk closer to onset, and gastroenteritis a risk for IBS (OR 1.47, compared to a fatigue syndrome). Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) shared more distant risk markers with IBS than other fatigue syndromes, particularly other symptom-based disorders (OR 3.8) and depressive disorders (OR 2.3), but depressive disorders were a greater risk for CFS than IBS (OR 2.4). Viral infections were more of a recent risk marker for CFS compared to IBS (OR 2.8), with gastroenteritis a greater risk for IBS (OR 2.4). Conclusions Both fatigue and irritable bowel syndromes share predisposing risk markers, but triggering risk markers differ. Fatigue syndromes are heterogeneous, with CFS sharing predisposing risks with IBS, suggesting a common predisposing pathophysiology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":59},"references":37,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
