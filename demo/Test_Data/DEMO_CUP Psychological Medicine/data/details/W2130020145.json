This study investigates VSWM impairment in children with DD. Method A cross-sectional study of VSWM in 6- to 12-year-old children with medication-naive DD ( n =26) compared to an age-, gender- and ‘performance IQ’ (PIQ)-matched healthy control group ( n =28) was completed. Results The DD group demonstrated impairment in VSWM, including impairment in the spatial span and strategy components of VSWM. Furthermore, the VSWM impairment remained after controlling for spatial span. Inattentive symptoms were significantly associated with the VSWM impairment. Conclusions This study of children with DD found deficits in performance on VSWM tasks, suggesting that fronto-striatal–parietal neural networks that underlie processes of attention and the executive component of VSWM are dysfunctional in children with DD. These findings further our understanding of DD and suggest more specific interventions that might improve functioning.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":20},"references":57,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
