Children with emotional disorders were particularly reactive to situations with aversive components, while conduct disorder subjects showed increased reactivity to pleasant situations and decreased responses to neutral but high-intensity stimulation and to withdrawal of stimulation in silence periods. The results indicate patterns of biological reactivity which may underlie different psychiatric disturbances in children.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":53},"references":43,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
