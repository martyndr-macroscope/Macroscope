The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy of slow-frequency rTMS to the frontal cortex in MDD. Method A literature search was carried out in the databases PubMed and Web of Science in the period between January 1994 and July 2009 with the search terms ‘depression’ and ‘transcranial magnetic stimulation’. Nine double-blind sham-controlled parallel intention-to-treat studies (252 patients) fulfilled inclusion criteria and were entered in a random-effects meta-analysis. Results The test for heterogeneity was not significant (Q T =9.63, p =0.38). An overall weighted moderate mean effect size ( d =0.63, 95% confidence interval=0.03–1.24) for active treatment was observed. Conclusions The findings suggest that slow-frequency rTMS to the frontal cortex is more effective than sham treatment and may be equally effective as fast-frequency rTMS in the treatment of MDD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":140},"references":41,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
