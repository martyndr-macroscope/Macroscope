In the current study, we investigated associations between cannabis use and biomarkers of inflammation. Methods Utilizing a sample of 914 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we investigated whether interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF α ), C-reactive protein (CRP), and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) measured at age 24 were associated with past year daily cannabis use, less frequent cannabis use, and no past year cannabis use. We adjusted for a number of covariates including sociodemographic measures, body mass index, childhood trauma, and tobacco smoking. We found evidence of a strong association between daily or near daily cannabis use and suPAR. Results We did not find any associations between less frequent cannabis use and suPAR. We did not find evidence of an association between IL-6, TNF α or CRP, and cannabis use. Conclusions Our finding that frequent cannabis use is strongly associated with suPAR, a biomarker of systemic chronic inflammation implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes is novel. These findings may provide valuable insights into biological mechanisms by which cannabis affects the brain and impacts the risk of serious mental disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":0},"references":84,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
