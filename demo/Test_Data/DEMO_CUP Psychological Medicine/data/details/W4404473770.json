The effects of unpredictability on psychopathology and the underlying neural mechanisms, however, remain unclear. It is also unknown how unpredictability interacts with other dimensions of adversities in predicting brain development and psychopathology of youth. Methods We applied cluster robust standard errors to examine how unpredictability was associated with the developmental changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of large-scale brain networks implicated in psychopathology, as well as the moderating role of deprivation, using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, which included four measurements from baseline (mean ± s.d. age, 119.13 ± 7.51 months; 2815 females) to 3-year follow-up ( N = 5885). Results After controlling for threat, unpredictability was associated with a smaller increase in rsFC within default mode network (DMN) and a smaller decrease in rsFC between cingulo-opercular network (CON) and DMN. Neighborhood educational deprivation moderated the associations between unpredictability and changes in rsFC within DMN and fronto-parietal network (FPN), as well as between CON and DMN. A smaller decrease in rsFC between CON and DMN mediated the association between unpredictability and externalizing problems. Neighborhood educational deprivation moderated the indirect pathway from unpredictability to externalizing problems via a smaller decrease in CON-DMN rsFC. Conclusions Our findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the associations between unpredictability and adolescents' psychopathology and the moderating role of deprivation, highlighting the significance of providing stable environment and abundant educational opportunities to facilitate optimal development.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":4},"references":94,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
