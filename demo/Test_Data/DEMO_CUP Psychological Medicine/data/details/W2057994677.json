Comparison of the intraclass correlation coefficients for each of the recorded AAR parameters between the two twin series and a constructed series of genetically unrelated individuals indicated that individual differences in the variables measured were significantly influenced by heredity. The findings are discussed in relation to previously reported studies of the genetic aspects of the normal spontaneous EEG.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":11},"references":64,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
