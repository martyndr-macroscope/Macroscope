Method A large population-based public survey with community-dwelling adults ( n =1046) ascertained through random digit dialling. Attitudes were assessed by structured interviews. Results The study found strong interest in predictive genetic testing for a reported susceptibility to depression. Once the benefits and disadvantages of such testing had been considered, there was significantly greater interest in seeking such a test through a doctor (63%) compared to direct-to-consumer (DTC; 40%) ( p &lt;0.001). Personal history of mental illness [odds ratio (OR) 2.58, p &lt;0.001], self-estimation of being at higher than average risk for depression (OR 1.92, p &lt;0.001), belief that a genetic component would increase rather than decrease stigma (OR 1.62, p &lt;0.001), and endorsement of benefits of genetic testing (OR 3.47, p &lt;0.001) significantly predicted interest in having such a test. Conclusions Despite finding attitudes that genetic links to mental illness would increase rather than decrease stigma, we found strong community acceptance of depression risk genotyping, even though a predisposition to depression may only manifest upon exposure to stressful life events. Our results suggest that there will be a strong demand for predictive genetic testing.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":40},"references":38,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
