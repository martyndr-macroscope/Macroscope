We aim to provide mechanistic insights into this association using brain network topology and to examine the potential role of parent–child reading in mitigating the effects of screen time. Methods We examined the association of screen time on brain network topology using linear regression analysis and tested if the network topology mediated the association between screen time and later socio-emotional competence. Lastly, we tested if parent–child reading time was a moderator of the link between screen time and brain network topology. Results Infant screen time was significantly associated with the emotion processing-cognitive control network integration ( p = 0.005). This network integration also significantly mediated the association between screen time and both measures of socio-emotional competence (BRIEF-2 Emotion Regulation Index, p = 0.04; SEARS total score, p = 0.04). Parent–child reading time significantly moderated the association between screen time and emotion processing-cognitive control network integration ( β = −0.640, p = 0.005). Conclusion Our study identified emotion processing-cognitive control network integration as a plausible biological pathway linking screen time in infancy and later socio-emotional competence. We also provided novel evidence for the role of parent–child reading in moderating the association between screen time and topological brain restructuring in early childhood.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":13},"references":79,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
