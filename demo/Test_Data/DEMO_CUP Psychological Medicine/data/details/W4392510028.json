In this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized control trial (RCT), we assessed whether intranasal oxytocin (OT) augments the therapeutic efficacy of psychotherapy for MDD and improves the therapeutic alliance. Methods Twenty-three volunteers (12 female) with MDD underwent 16 sessions of interpersonal therapy. Prior to each session, volunteers self-administered 24 International Units of intranasal OT ( n = 12; Syntocinon ) or placebo ( n = 11). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology at pre- and post-treatment, and at a six month follow-up. Results Multilevel modeling found a significant effect of OT on the negative slope of depressive symptoms over time ( p &lt; 0.05), with medium-large effect sizes at post-treatment (Cohen's d = 0.75) and follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.82). Drug intervention also predicted the intercept when examining the weekly ratings of the therapeutic alliance ( p &lt; 0.05), such that volunteers receiving OT, relative to placebo, reported improved therapeutic alliance at session 1. The agreement of goals between therapists and participants, a facet of the therapeutic alliance, mediated the relationship between drug intervention and clinical outcome. Conclusion In this pilot study, the administration of intranasal OT, relative to placebo, improved the therapeutic alliance at the beginning of therapy and therapeutic efficacy of psychotherapy in persons with MDD. Future RCTs should attempt to replicate these findings in larger samples with different therapeutic modalities ( ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02405715 ).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":74,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
