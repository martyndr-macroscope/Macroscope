In most patients the biochemical values were also determined shortly before the patient's discharge from hospital. The Na-K ATPase and the ouabain sensitive potassium influx increased significantly with improvement in the depressive mood rating.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":123},"references":28,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
