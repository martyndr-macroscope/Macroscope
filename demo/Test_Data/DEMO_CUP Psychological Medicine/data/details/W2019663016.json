Understanding the role of obstetric complications (OCs) in schizophrenia could potentially shed light on the heterogeneity in the aetiology and course of schizophrenia. Many investigators have reported an association between OCs and schizophrenia, but few have examined the association between OCs and treatment outcome. We investigated this question in a sample of patients studied during their first episode of schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder. Method. OC histories were obtained for 59 patients participating in the Hillside First Episode Study. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of OCs on treatment response during the first episode of schizophrenia. Results. Twelve of the 59 patients (20%) had positive histories of OCs. This group exhibited lower rates of treatment response than those with negative OC histories (hazard ratio controlling for sex = 0·28; 95% CI = 0·13, 0·62). The positive OC group also had significantly greater lateral ventricle volume, baseline disorganization and number of live births. The effect of OC history on treatment response held when these three variables were controlled for. Conclusion. A history of obstetric complications predicted poor response to treatment in the first episode of schizophrenia. This large effect was based on a small sample of 59 patients. Thus, replication is called for.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":29},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
