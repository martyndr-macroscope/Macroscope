Data-driven subtyping of this clinically heterogeneous patient population and the associated underlying neural mechanisms are highly needed to identify who will benefit from psychotherapy. Methods In 53 comorbid PTSD/AUD patients, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected prior to undergoing individual psychotherapy. We used a data-driven approach to subgroup patients based on directed connectivity profiles. Connectivity subgroups were compared on clinical measures of PTSD severity and heavy alcohol use collected at pre- and post-treatment. Results We identified a subgroup of patients associated with improvement in PTSD symptoms from integrated-prolonged exposure therapy. This subgroup was characterized by lower insula to inferior parietal cortex (IPC) connectivity, higher pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) to posterior midcingulate cortex connectivity and a unique pgACC to IPC path. We did not observe any connectivity subgroup that uniquely benefited from integrated-coping skills or subgroups associated with change in alcohol consumption. Conclusions Data-driven approaches to characterize PTSD/AUD subtypes have the potential to identify brain network profiles that are implicated in the benefit from psychological interventions – setting the stage for future research that targets these brain circuit communication patterns to boost treatment efficacy.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":9},"references":90,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
