The results suggest that the high utilization of medical admissions by psychiatric patients could not be explained simply by coincident chronic physical illness or particular types of physical disease including the somatic complications of mental disorders. It is more likely to be attributable to other factors such as an increased general susceptibility to physical illness, different forms of illness behaviour, and the process of somatization.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":30},"references":18,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
