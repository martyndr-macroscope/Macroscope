Knowledge on latent classes and transitions between these classes over time based on longitudinal disorder status information provides insight into clustering of meaningful groups with different disease prognosis. Methods Data of all four waves of the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 were used, a representative population-based study of adults (mean duration between two successive waves = 3 years; N at T0 = 6646; T1 = 5303; T2 = 4618; T3 = 4007; this results in a total number of data points: 20 574). Presence of eight mood and anxiety DSM-IV disorders was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Latent class analysis and latent Markov modelling were used. Results The best fitting model identified four classes: a healthy class (prevalence: 94.1%), depressed-worried class (3.6%; moderate-to-high proportions of mood disorders and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), fear class (1.8%; moderate-to-high proportions of panic and phobia disorders) and high comorbidity class (0.6%). In longitudinal analyses over a three-year period, the minority of those in the depressed-worried and high comorbidity class persisted in their class over time (36.5% and 38.4%, respectively), whereas the majority in the fear class did (67.3%). Suggestive of recovery is switching to the healthy class, this was 39.7% in the depressed-worried class, 12.5% in the fear class and 7.0% in the high comorbidity class. Conclusions People with panic or phobia disorders have a considerably more persistent and chronic disease course than those with depressive disorders including GAD. Consequently, they could especially benefit from longer-term monitoring and disease management.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":1},"references":52,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
