In the current study none of the ‘vulnerability factors’ proposed by Brown &amp; Harris fulfilled the requirements of the model. It was, however, found that working class women with children seemed particularly prone to develop minor psychiatric disorder in response to adversity. A similar result is apparent in the analyses of the earlier authors. A number of studies now published give some support to the vulnerability model using what are broadly measures of social support, but there is little corroboration using the other variables proposed by Brown &amp; Harris.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":12,"cited_by_count":118},"references":41,"networkCitations":12,"seed":false}
