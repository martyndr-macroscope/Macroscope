Affective psychotic patients showed greater reaction time facilitation than did either schizophrenic patients or non-patient controls. Computer simulations of a ‘statistical facilitation’ model for these data are also presented.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":10},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
