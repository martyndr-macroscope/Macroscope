Decrease in IL-2 production, a finding frequently associated with many autoimmune diseases, was associated with an elevation in anti-hippocampal antibody optical density (AHA-OD) in schizophrenic patients. Although some control subjects had elevated antibody levels, this elevation was not associated with decreased IL-2 production. Low IL-2 production is well known to be a state marker associated with active autoimmune disease. We suggest that production of hippocampal antibody is a trait marker of vulnerability to autoimmune diseases. Thus, our finding of low IL-2 production in patients with high concentrations of hippocampal antibody is compatible with the possibility that such patients have an ongoing autoimmune process.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":46},"references":39,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
