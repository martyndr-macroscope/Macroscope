Viral infection during the prenatal stage constitutes one of the most relevant risk factors for the development of schizophrenia later in adulthood. Methods A narrative review was conducted to explore the link between viral infections and schizophrenia, as well as the neuropsychiatric effects of antiviral drugs, particularly in the context of this specific mental condition. Literature searches were performed using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Results Several viral infections, such as herpesviruses, influenza virus, Borna disease virus, and coronaviruses, can directly or indirectly disrupt normal fetal brain development by modifying gene expression in the maternal immune system, thereby contributing to the pathophysiological symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, neuropsychiatric effects caused by antiviral drugs are frequent and represent significant adverse outcomes for viral treatment. Conclusions Epidemiological evidence suggests a potential relationship between viruses and schizophrenia. Increases in inflammatory cytokine levels and changes in the expression of key genes observed in several viral infections may constitute potential links between these viral infections and schizophrenia. Furthermore, antivirals may affect the central nervous system, although for most drugs, their mechanisms of action are still unclear, and a strong relationship between antivirals and schizophrenia has not yet been established.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":2},"references":401,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
