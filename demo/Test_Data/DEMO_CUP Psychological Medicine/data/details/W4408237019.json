Crow, whose contributions provided great insights into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and continue to shape many questions in the field. We compile his key works relating to psychotic disorders, focusing on the trajectory of his theoretical stance. Our account is interlaced with our own interpretation of the evidence that influenced Crow’s arguments over the years as well as his scientific method. Crow has had a significant impact on the neuroscience of schizophrenia. Many of his observations are still valid and several questions he raised remain unanswered to date.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":40,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
