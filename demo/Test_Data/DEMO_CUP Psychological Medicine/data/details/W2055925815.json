Independent raters were able to assess reliably the presence and absence of a variety of variables concerned with the individual's behaviour, school, family, and involvement with social work agencies. In 68 instances teachers' questionnaires measuring psychiatric disturbance had been completed. There was no evidence that truancy in these circumstances is a homogeneous condition. At least 3 independent sets of features appear to be involved in most cases. One involves antisocial and educational problems (‘clinical truancy’), a second is concerned with adverse social factors and parental complicity (‘school withdrawal’), and a third set includes a tendency to social isolation (‘school refusal’). There was no evidence that individuals tend to exhibit one of these features to the exclusion of the others.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":17},"references":16,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
