The mean score of the EAT was 14·9, significantly above that reported for males in other studies. The response rate was poor, but 10 jockeys agreed to a full psychiatric and eating interview. The majority of jockeys interviewed reported food avoidance, the use of saunas, and the abuse of laxatives. Diuretics and appetite suppressants were also used. Bingeing was common, but self-induced vomiting was unusual. Current weights were 13% below, and the lowest reported weights 21% below, matched population mean weights. The relationship between these forms of eating behaviour and clinical eating disorders is discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":59},"references":19,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
