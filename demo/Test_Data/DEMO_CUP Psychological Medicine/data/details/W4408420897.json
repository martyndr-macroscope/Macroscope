This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide up-to-date information on the global prevalence of co-morbid anxiety and depression in pregnant and postpartum women and to further investigate the sources of heterogeneity. Systematic searches of eight electronic databases were conducted for original studies published from inception to December 10, 2024. We selected studies that directly reported prevalence data on co-morbid anxiety and depression during the perinatal periods. We extracted data from published study reports and calculated the pooled prevalence of symptoms of co-morbid anxiety and depression. There are 122 articles involving 560,736 women from 43 different countries included in this review. The global prevalence of co-morbid anxiety and depression during the perinatal period was about 9% (95%CI 8%–10%), with approximately 9% (95%CI 8%–11%) in pregnant women and 8% (95%CI 7%–10%) in postpartum women. Prevalence varied significantly by the assessment time points, study country, study design, and the assessment tool used for anxiety and depression, while prevalence was not dependent on publication year, country income level, and COVID-19 context. No publication bias was observed for this prevalence rate. These findings suggest that approximately 1 in 10 women experience co-morbid anxiety and depression during pregnancy and postpartum. Targeted action is needed to reduce this burden.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":51,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
