Our interpretation of the results is that the latter 3 clusters differ from the main group of endogenous depressives by their greater inner involvement with the world around them, though this involvement assumes different forms in the 3 groups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":8},"references":40,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
