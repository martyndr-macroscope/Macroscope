Many forms of psychopathology are characterized by dysfunctional emotional reactivity. The late positive potential (LPP) is an event-related potential component that provides an index of neurobiological emotional reactivity. Several categorical disorders have demonstrated a similar association with the emotion-modulated LPP. It is possible that higher-order dimensional representations of psychopathology might explain the comparable results. The present study examined the association between HiTOP-consistent pathological personality dimensions across multiple levels of the hierarchy and neurobiological emotional reactivity. Methods The sample included 215 18–35-year-old adults (86% female) who were oversampled for psychopathology. Participants completed the emotional interrupt task while electroencephalography was recorded to examine the LPP. Participants also completed the Comprehensive Assessment of Traits relevant to Personality Disorders to assess pathological personality. Results At the spectra level, higher negative emotionality was associated with a larger emotion-modulated LPP, while higher detachment was associated with a smaller emotion-modulated LPP. There were no associations between higher-order psychopathology levels and the emotion-modulated LPP. Compared to categorical diagnoses, spectra-level personality pathology dimensions significantly improved the prediction of the emotion-modulated LPP. Conclusions The present study indicates that HiTOP spectra levels of negative emotionality and detachment demonstrate unique associations with neurobiological emotional reactivity. The study highlights the utility of examining dimensional and hierarchical, rather than categorical, representations of psychopathology in the attempt to identify the neurobiological origins of psychopathology.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":45,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
