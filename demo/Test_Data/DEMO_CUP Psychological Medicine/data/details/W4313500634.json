However, little is known about how brain structure and inflammation relate to the heterogeneity of treatment response in the months following an index ECT course. Methods A naturalistic six-month study following an index ECT course included 20 subjects with treatment-resistant depression. Upon conclusion of the index ECT course and again after six months, structural magnetic resonance imaging scans and peripheral inflammation measures [interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF- α ), and C-reactive protein] were obtained. Voxel-based morphometry processed with the CAT-12 Toolbox was used to estimate changes in gray matter volume. Results Between the end of the index ECT course and the end of follow-up, we found four clusters of significant decreases in gray matter volume ( p &lt; 0.01, FWE) and no regions of increased volume. Decreased HAM-D scores were significantly related only to reduced IL-8 level. Decreased volume in one cluster, which included the right insula and Brodmann's Area 22, was related to increased HAM-D scores over six months. IL-8 levels did not mediate or moderate the relationship between volumetric change and depression. Conclusions Six months after an index ECT course, multiple regions of decreased gray matter volume were observed in a naturalistic setting. The independent relations between brain volume and inflammation to depressive symptoms suggest novel explanations of the heterogeneity of longer-term ECT treatment response.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":6},"references":68,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
