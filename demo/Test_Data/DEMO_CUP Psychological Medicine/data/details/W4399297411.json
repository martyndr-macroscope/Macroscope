The dysfunction of default mode network (DMN) is critical for self-referential and emotional mental processes and is implicated in BD. The current study aims to explore the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, i.e. glutamate and γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA), in hubs of the DMN during the euthymic patients with BD (euBD). Method Thirty-four euBD and 55 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to the study. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS), glutamate (with PRESS sequence) and GABA levels (with MEGAPRESS sequence) were measured in the medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/ACC) and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC). Measured concentrations of excitatory glutamate/glutamine (Glx) and inhibitory GABA were used to calculate the excitatory/inhibitory ( E / I ) ratio. Executive and attentional functions were respectively assessed using the Wisconsin card-sorting test and continuous performance test. Results euBD performed worse on attentional function than controls ( p = 0.001). Compared to controls, euBD had higher E / I ratios in the PCC ( p = 0.023), mainly driven by a higher Glx level in the PCC of euBD ( p = 0.002). Only in the BD group, a marginally significant negative association between the mPFC E / I ratio (Glx/GABA) and executive function was observed ( p = 0.068). Conclusions Disturbed E/I balance, particularly elevated Glx/GABA ratio in PCC is observed in euBD. The E / I balance in hubs of DMN may serve as potential biomarkers for euBD, which may also contribute to their poorer executive function.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":53,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
