He published eight monographs, five of which were of eminent importance and at least two exerted considerable influence on European psychiatry for several decades, namely Der sensitive Beziehungswahn (1918) and Körperbau und Charakter (1921). His theory on constitutional body types and character became an integral part of German schoolbooks.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":5},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
