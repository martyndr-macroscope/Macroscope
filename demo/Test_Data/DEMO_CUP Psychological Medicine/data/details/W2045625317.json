We investigate changes of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns during the recall of unresolved adverse life events (ULE) over 1 year. Method Thirteen female BPD patients participated in the study. During fMRI measurement subjects recalled ULE and negative but resolved life events (RLE) after individual cue words to stimulate autobiographical memory retrieval. Subjective intensity of emotional and sensoric experiences during recall was assessed as well as standardized measures of psychopathology. Results A 2×2 factorial analysis of fMRI data (Δt1/t2×ΔULE/RLE) revealed major right more than left differences of activation (i.e. t1&gt;t2) of the posterior more than anterior cingulate, superior temporal lobes, insula, and right middle and superior frontal lobes (second-level analysis, t =3.0, p uncorrected =0.003). The opposite contrast (Δt2/t1×ΔULE/RLE) did not reveal any differences. We did not find changes of emotional or sensoric qualities during recall (ULE versus RLE) or of psychopathology measures over the 1-year period. Conclusions Although subjective and clinical data did not change within 1 year, we observed a substantial decrease of temporo-frontal activation during the recall of ULE from t1 to t2. If future research confirms these findings, the question arises whether the decrease of neural activation precedes clinical improvement in BPD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":25},"references":38,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
