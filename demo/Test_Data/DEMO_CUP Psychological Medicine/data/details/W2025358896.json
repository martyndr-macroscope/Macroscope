Rural domicile, a diagnosis of schizophrenia, long dependence on services, and ease of access to care comprised an aftercare dependency syndrome with substantial predictive power. Alcoholic and personality disordered patients were light users of services. Staff—patient relationships and attitudes of staff and patients to the need for aftercare were important. Depot neuroleptics were associated with high levels of aftercare for patients with chronic schizophrenia. The findings reveal the steady silting up of a new area service for the adult mentally ill by patients with a combination of social disadvantage and severe chronic psychosis. Family doctors played very little part in the delivery of aftercare. Some implications of the findings for the future development of community-based psychiatric services are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":11},"references":17,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
