Additionally, inhibitory control may be a target for intervention. Methods Behavioral performance on a developmentally appropriate Go/No-Go task including a frustration manipulation completed by children ages 3–5 years (early childhood; n = 107) was examined in relation to psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; ‘tween’; ages 9–12), internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms self-reported at long-term follow-up (pre-adolescence; ages 8–11). ERP N200 amplitude for a subset of these children ( n = 34) with electrophysiological data during the task was examined as an index of inhibitory control. Results Children with lower accuracy on No-Go trials compared to Go trials in early childhood ( F (1,101) = 3.976, p = 0.049), evidenced higher PLEs at the transition to adolescence 4–9 years later, reflecting a specific deficit in inhibitory control. No association was observed with internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Decreased accuracy during the frustration manipulation predicted higher internalizing, F (2,202) = 5.618, p = 0.004, and externalizing symptoms, F (2,202) = 4.663, p = 0.010. Smaller N200 amplitudes were observed on No-Go trials for those with higher PLEs, F (1,101) = 6.075, p = 0.020; no relationship was observed for internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Conclusions Long-term follow-up demonstrates for the first time a specific deficit in inhibitory control behaviorally and electrophysiology, for individuals who later report more PLEs. Decreases in task performance under frustration induction indicated risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that pathophysiological mechanisms for psychosis are relevant and discriminable in early childhood, and further, suggest an identifiable and potentially modifiable target for early intervention.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":73,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
