It is unknown whether SG deficit leads to poor neurocognitive, social, and/or real-world functioning. This study aimed to explore the longitudinal relationships between SG and these variables. Methods Seventy-nine EP patients and 88 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited at baseline. Thirty-three and 20 EP patients completed 12-month and 24-month follow-up, respectively. SG was measured using the auditory dual-click (S1 &amp; S2) paradigm and quantified as P50 ratio (S2/S1) and difference (S1-S2). Cognition, real-life functioning, and symptoms were assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, Global Functioning: Social (GFS) and Role (GFR), Multnomah Community Ability Scale (MCAS), Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT), and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, mixed model, correlation and regression analyses were used for group comparisons and relationships among variables controlling for potential confounding variables. Results In EP patients, P50 ratio ( p &lt; 0.05) and difference ( p &lt; 0.001) at 24-month showed significant differences compared with that at baseline. At baseline, P50 indices (ratio, S1-S2 difference, S1) were independently associated with GFR in HCs (all p &lt; 0.05); in EP patients, S2 amplitude was independently associated with GFS ( p = 0.037). At 12-month and 24-month, P50 indices (ratio, S1, S2) was independently associated with MCAS (all p &lt; 0.05). S1-S2 difference was a trending predictor of future function (GFS or MCAS). Conclusions SG showed progressive reduction in EP patients. P50 indices were related to real-life functioning.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":81,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
