The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of behavioural/psycho-educational group training in men who are chronically stressed from overworking. Method Of 72 male subjects, 36 were randomly assigned to training for 8 weeks and another 36 formed the control group, which received a placebo intervention. Primary outcome measures were systolic blood pressure, salivary cortisol concentration upon awakening, and self-reported changes on the scales of the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress (TICS), the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Results A significant reduction in mean values was observed in daily systolic blood pressure and salivary cortisol concentration on all the TICS and most of the STAXI and SF-36 scales. Conclusions Behavioural/psycho-educational group training appears to be effective in the treatment of men suffering from chronic stress due to overworking.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":24},"references":15,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
