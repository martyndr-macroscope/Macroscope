However, it is unclear whether these risks make epigenetic clocks ‘tick faster’ (i.e. accelerate biological aging). The current study examines concurrent and lagged within-person changes of a variety of health risks associated with epigenetic aging. Methods Individuals from the Great Smoky Mountains Study were followed from age 9 to 35 years. DNA methylation profiles were assessed from blood, at multiple timepoints (i.e. waves) for each individual. Health risks were psychiatric, lifestyle, and adversity factors. Concurrent ( N = 539 individuals; 1029 assessments) and lagged ( N = 380 individuals; 760 assessments) analyses were used to determine the link between health risks and epigenetic aging. Results Concurrent models showed that BMI ( r = 0.15, P FDR &lt; 0.01) was significantly correlated to epigenetic aging at the subject-level but not wave-level. Lagged models demonstrated that depressive symptoms ( b = 1.67 months per symptom, P FDR = 0.02) in adolescence accelerated epigenetic aging in adulthood, also when models were fully adjusted for BMI, smoking, and cannabis and alcohol use. Conclusions Within-persons, changes in health risks were unaccompanied by concurrent changes in epigenetic aging, suggesting that it is unlikely for risks to immediately ‘accelerate’ epigenetic aging. However, time lagged analyses indicated that depressive symptoms in childhood/adolescence predicted epigenetic aging in adulthood. Together, findings suggest that age-related biological embedding of depressive symptoms is not instant but provides prognostic opportunities. Repeated measurements and longer follow-up times are needed to examine stable and dynamic contributions of childhood experiences to epigenetic aging across the lifespan.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":55,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
