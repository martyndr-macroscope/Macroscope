The hypothesis is supported with respect to ‘old and handicapped’ suicide, which predominates in middleclass areas with established residents of middle-class status; and with respect to ‘sociopathic’ suicide, which predominates in central areas with high rates of social pathology of all kinds, and poor housing conditions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":26},"references":6,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
