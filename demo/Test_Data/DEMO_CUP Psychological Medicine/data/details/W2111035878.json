It was found that a reduction in the numbers of rating categories, from six to three or four led to consistencies in response while deletion of several items led to consistent scales of symptoms that accorded with an item response characterization. Behaviours included in the final scales varied in the numbers of categories, and in the range of symptom level covered by a category. Relationships between scores representing symptoms were found to be modelled better by a factor structure that included a third overlapping ‘cognitive’ factor in addition to the now traditional positive and negative factors, than by the original positive and negative factors alone.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":18},"references":32,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
