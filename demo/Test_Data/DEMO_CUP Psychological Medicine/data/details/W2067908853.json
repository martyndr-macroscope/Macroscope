Future studies need to assess a broader range of adversities and disorders and to explore the existence and effects of commonly occurring adversity clusters. Replication is needed to verify that the effects of childhood adversities are mostly on first onset rather than on the creation of vulnerabilities that lead to increased risk of persistence.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":34,"cited_by_count":1300},"references":0,"networkCitations":34,"seed":false}
