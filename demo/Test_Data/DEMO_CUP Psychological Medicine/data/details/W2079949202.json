This is achieved by measurement of plasma levels of oestrogen-stimulated neurophysin (ESN) following an oestrogen challenge. In normal women the ESN response to ethinyl oestradiol is dose-dependent. This response is attenuated in normal women during the first postpartum month, although it is unchanged in patients with anorexia nervosa, in spite of their similar concurrent hypo-estrogenic state. The altered puerperal response may result from the acute oestrogen withdrawal which occurs at delivery. The time course of the altered ESN response coincides with the period of maximum risk for puerperal psychosis. The ESN response to oestrogen provides a novel neuroendocrine measure to test the relevance of changes in central oestrogen receptor responsiveness in the pathogenesis of puerperal psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":21,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
