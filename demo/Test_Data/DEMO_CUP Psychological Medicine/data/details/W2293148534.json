Preventing the development of such maladaptive memory is a key aim in preventing the development of PTSD. We examined whether the N -methyl d -aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist gas nitrous oxide (N 2 O) could reduce the frequency of intrusive memories by inhibiting NMDAR-dependent memory consolidation in a laboratory analogue of psychological trauma. Method Participants were randomized to inhale N 2 O ( N = 25) or medical air ( N = 25) after viewing a negatively valenced emotional film clip (‘trauma film’). Participants subsequently completed a daily diary assessing frequency of intrusive thoughts relating to the film clip. A week later, participants completed an explicit memory recall task related to the film. Results Post-encoding N 2 O sped the reduction in intrusive memory frequency, with a significant reduction by the next day in the N 2 O group compared to 4 days later in the air group. N 2 O also interacted with post-film dissociation, producing increased intrusion frequency in those who were highly dissociated at baseline. Sleep length and quality the night after viewing the film did not differ between the groups. Conclusion N 2 O speeds the reduction of intrusive analogue trauma memory in a time-dependent manner, consistent with sleep-dependent long-term consolidation disruption. Further research with this drug is warranted to determine its potential to inoculate against enduring effects of psychological trauma; however, caution is also urged in dissociated individuals where N 2 O may aggravate PTSD-like symptomatology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":46},"references":59,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
