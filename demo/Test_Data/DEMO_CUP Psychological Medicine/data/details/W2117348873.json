The resultant attitudes were more in line with those of teaching staff than those of the clinical team. Overall, the students developed a more positive view of psychiatry.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":26},"references":13,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
