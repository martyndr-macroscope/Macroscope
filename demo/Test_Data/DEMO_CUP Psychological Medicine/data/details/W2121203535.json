Increasing age and male sex were both associated with larger ventricular size in both patient and control groups. Controlling for these effects, the depressed patients had larger ventricles than the control subjects. In the patient group there was no association between ventricular size, course of illness or exposure to drug treatment or electroconvulsive therapy.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":111},"references":25,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
