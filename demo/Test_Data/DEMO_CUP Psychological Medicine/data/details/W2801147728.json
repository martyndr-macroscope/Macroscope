This study tests the primary hypothesis that omega-3 ( ω -3), both alone and in conjunction with social skills training, will have particular post-treatment efficacy for reducing childhood reactive aggression relative to baseline. Methods In this randomized, double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled, factorial trial, a clinical sample of 282 children with externalizing behavior aged 7–16 years was randomized into ω -3 only, social skills only, ω -3 + social skills, and placebo control groups. Treatment duration was 6 months. The primary outcome measure was reactive aggression collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, with antisocial behavior as a secondary outcome. Results Children in the ω -3-only group showed a short-term reduction (at 3 and 6 months) in self-report reactive aggression, and also a short-term reduction in overall antisocial behavior. Sensitivity analyses and a robustness check replicated significant interaction effects. Effect sizes ( d ) were small, ranging from 0.17 to 0.31. Conclusions Findings provide some initial support for the efficacy of ω -3 in reducing reactive aggression over and above standard care (medication and parent training), but yield only preliminary and limited support for the efficacy of ω -3 in reducing overall externalizing behavior in children. Future studies could test further whether ω -3 shows promise in reducing more reactive, impulsive forms of aggression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":24},"references":35,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
