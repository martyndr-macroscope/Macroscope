No significant differences were found between patients and normal controls for any of the physiological variables. The results do not substantiate the previous finding of glucose hypermetabolism in autism; the likely reasons for the variance in findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":79},"references":39,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
