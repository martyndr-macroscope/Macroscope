Methods The Embase, PubMed and PsycINFO databases were systematically searched for longitudinal studies reporting measurements of blood compounds in drug-naïve first-episode schizophrenia or MDD. Results For this random-effects meta-analysis, we retrieved a total of 31 studies comprising 1818 schizophrenia patients, and 14 studies comprising 469 MDD patients. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increased following treatment in schizophrenia (Hedges' g ( g ): 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39–0.70; p &lt; 0.001) and MDD ( g : 0.51; CI 0.06–0.96; p = 0.027). Interleukin (IL)-6 levels decreased in schizophrenia ( g : −0.48; CI −0.85 to −0.11; p = 0.011), and for MDD a trend of decreased IL-6 levels was observed ( g : −0.39; CI −0.87 to 0.09; p = 0.115). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α ) also decreased in schizophrenia ( g : −0.34; CI −0.68 to −0.01; p = 0.047) and in MDD ( g : −1.02; CI −1.79 to −0.25; p = 0.009). Fasting glucose levels increased only in schizophrenia ( g : 0.26; CI 0.07–0.44; p = 0.007), but not in MDD. No changes were found for C-reactive protein, IL-1 β , IL-2 and IL-4. Conclusions Psychopharmacological treatment has modulating effects on BDNF and TNF α in drug-naïve first-episode patients with either schizophrenia or MDD. These findings support efforts for further research into transdiagnostic preventive strategies and augmentation therapy for those with immune dysfunctions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":36},"references":87,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
