What explains this range of PLE prevalence? Despite extensive research, the clinical significance of PLEs remains unclear. Are PLE prevalence and clinical severity differentially associated across ethnoracial groups? Methods We examined the lifetime prevalence and clinical significance of PLEs across ethnoracial groups in the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys ( N = 11 139) using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) psychosis symptom screener. Outcomes included mental healthcare use (inpatient, outpatient), mental health morbidity (self-perceived poor/fair mental health, suicidal ideation or attempts), and impairment (role interference). Individuals with outcome onsets prior to PLE onset were excluded. We also examined associations of PLEs with CIDI diagnoses. Cox proportional-hazards regression and logistic regression modeling identified associations of interest. Results Contrary to previous reports, only Asian Americans differed significantly from other U.S. ethnoracial groups, reporting lower lifetime prevalence (6.7% v. 8.0–11.9%) and mean number (0.09 v. 0.11–0.18) of PLEs. In multivariate analyses, PLE clinical significance showed limited ethnoracial variation among Asian Americans, non-Caribbean Latinos, and Afro-Caribbeans. In other groups, mental health outcomes showed significant ethnoracial clustering by outcome (e.g. hospitalization and role interference with Caribbean-Latino origin), possibly due to underlying differences in psychiatric disorder chronicity or treatment barriers. Conclusions While there is limited ethnoracial variation in U.S. PLE prevalence, PLE clinical significance varies across U.S. ethnoracial groups. Clinicians should consider this variation when assessing PLEs to avoid exaggerating their clinical significance, contributing to mental healthcare disparities.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":3},"references":52,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
