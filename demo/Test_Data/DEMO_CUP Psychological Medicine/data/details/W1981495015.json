This paper describes the development and performance of an investigator-based interview (the PBE) for the detailed assessment of the behaviour of subjects over the preceding four weeks. The interview is designed to be administered to carers. A test–retest reliability study was carried out on the penultimate edition of this interview; and the inter-rater reliability of the final edition was measured. These studies show that the reliability of the PBE is comparable with that of other investigator-based interviews.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":106},"references":45,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
