The interactive effects between different types of CAs and FEP on CT remain understudied. Methods One-hundred sixteen individuals with FEP (mean age = 23.8 ± 6.9 years, 34% females, 80.2% non-affective FEP) and 98 healthy controls (HCs) (mean age = 24.4 ± 6.2 years, 43% females) reported the presence/absence of CA &lt;17 years using an adapted version of the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA.Q) and the Retrospective Bullying Questionnaire (RBQ) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Correlation analyses were used to assess associations between brain maps of CA and FEP effects. General linear models (GLMs) were performed to assess the interaction effects of CA and FEP on CT. Results Eighty-three individuals with FEP and 83 HCs reported exposure to at least one CA. CT alterations in FEP were similar to those found in participants exposed to separation from parents, bullying, parental discord, household poverty, and sexual abuse ( r = 0.50 to 0.25). Exposure to neglect ( β = −0.24, 95% CI [−0.37 to −0.12], p = 0.016) and overall maltreatment ( β = −0.13, 95% CI [−0.20 to −0.06], p = 0.043) were associated with cortical thinning in the right medial orbitofrontal region. Conclusions Cortical alterations in individuals with FEP are similar to those observed in the context of socio-environmental adversity. Neglect and maltreatment may contribute to CT reductions in FEP. Our findings provide new insights into the specific neurobiological effects of CA in early psychosis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":6},"references":110,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
