The ratio between the time for recall of pleasant and unpleasant experiences was found to fall progressively with increasing severity of depression or of ‘neuroticism’ and to be significantly related to each. Among patients who scored relatively low on depression or neuroticism pleasant memories were recalled more speedily than unpleasant; among those who scored high this relationship was reversed. Possible mechanisms to account for these findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":286},"references":17,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
