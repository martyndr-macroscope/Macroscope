Methods Using 1652 participants (51.75% female, baseline M age = 14.3) from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism, we employed latent growth curve models to (1) examine associations of childhood physical, sexual, and non-assaultive trauma (CPAT, CSAT, and CNAT) with repeated measures of alpha band EEG coherence (EEGc), and (2) assess whether EEGc trajectories were associated with AUD and PTSD symptoms. Sex-specific models accommodated sex differences in trauma exposure, AUD prevalence, and neural development. Results In females, CSAT was associated with higher mean levels of EEGc in left frontocentral (LFC, ß = 0.13, p = 0.01) and interhemispheric prefrontal (PFI, ß = 0.16, p &lt; 0.01) regions, but diminished growth in LFC (ß = −0.07, p = 0.02) and PFI (ß = −0.07, p = 0.02). In males, CPAT was associated with lower mean levels (ß = −0.17, p = 0.01) and increased growth (ß = 0.11, p = 0.01) of LFC EEGc. Slope of LFC EEGc was inversely associated with AUD symptoms in females (ß = −1.81, p = 0.01). Intercept of right frontocentral and PFI EEGc were associated with AUD symptoms in males, but in opposite directions. Significant associations between EEGc and PTSD symptoms were also observed in trauma-exposed individuals. Conclusions Childhood assaultive trauma is associated with changes in frontal alpha EEGc and subsequent AUD and PTSD symptoms, though patterns differ by sex and trauma type. EEGc findings may inform emerging treatments for PTSD and AUD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":1},"references":111,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
