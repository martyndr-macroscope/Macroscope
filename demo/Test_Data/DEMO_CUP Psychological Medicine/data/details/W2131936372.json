There was no statistically significant difference in the mean public expenditure for the two modes of care. The direct costs of psychiatric care comprised a small proportion of total public expenditure and were initially greater in the nursing group. Subsequently, and over the whole 18-month study period, nursing was the cheaper option in terms of these direct costs. Clinical and social outcomes were comparable in both follow-up groups. Consumer satisfaction was significantly greater among CPN patients. On balance, these results confirm the benefit of community psychiatric nursing for this patient group.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":41},"references":23,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
