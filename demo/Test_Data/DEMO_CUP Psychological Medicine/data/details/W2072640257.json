We have failed to find elevated platelet serotonin, or any relationship between platelet serotonin and MAO either in a group of unmedicated chronic schizophrenic patients or in a group of schizoaffective patients. Possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":43},"references":17,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
