Social isolation, which has similar detrimental effects on health, may be associated with accelerated brain aging though little is known about how different trajectories of social isolation across the life course moderate this association. We examined the associations between social isolation trajectories from age 5 to age 38 and brain age assessed at age 45. Methods We previously created a typology of social isolation based on onset during the life course and persistence into adulthood, using group-based trajectory analysis of longitudinal data from a New Zealand birth cohort. The typology comprises four groups: ‘never-isolated’, ‘adult-only’, ‘child-only’, and persistent ‘child-adult’ isolation. A brain age gap estimate (brainAGE) – the difference between predicted age from structural MRI date and chronological age – was derived at age 45. We undertook analyses of brainAGE with trajectory group as the predictor, adjusting for sex, family socio-economic status, and a range of familial and child-behavioral factors. Results Older brain age in mid-adulthood was associated with trajectories of social isolation after adjustment for family and child confounders, particularly for the ‘adult-only’ group compared to the ‘never-isolated’ group. Conclusions Although our findings are associational, they indicate that preventing social isolation, particularly in mid-adulthood, may help to avert accelerated brain aging associated with negative health outcomes later in life.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":4},"references":90,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
