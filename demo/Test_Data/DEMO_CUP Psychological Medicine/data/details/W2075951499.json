Twenty-two patients, successfully treated with nortriptyline (NT) in hospital for endogenous depression, continued the treatment for up to five months in the outpatient clinic. Plasma levels of NT were checked, and ratings were performed regularly. Depressive relapses, all related to low plasma levels of NT, were seen in three patients. The gas Chromatographic method, described in detail, has proved suitable for clinical routine and the results demonstrate the value of monitoring plasma levels in achieving therapeutic control.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":53},"references":28,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
