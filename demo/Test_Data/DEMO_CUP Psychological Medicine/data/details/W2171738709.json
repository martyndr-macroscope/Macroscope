It was found that defensiveness did not affect the reporting of somatic symptoms, but it significantly affected the reporting of all psychological distress. The effect of social desirability was more specific, only the GHQ social dysfunction subscale showing a significant correlation, an effect attributable to the influence of the setting in which the data were obtained.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":22},"references":32,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
