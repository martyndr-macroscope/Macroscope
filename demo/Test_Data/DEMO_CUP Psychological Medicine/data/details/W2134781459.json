It is an important construct in order to understand the interaction of the Maori with each other and with the Caucasian New Zealander, the behaviour of the Maori in cross-cultural settings, and the clinical presentations of some Maori patients. This paper examines some of the meanings of Whakama , its various behavioural manifestations and its possible causes. The clinical relevance to psychiatry is emphasized.
