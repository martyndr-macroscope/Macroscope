The results were that relative to control subjects, autistic individuals performed less well on the emotion tasks than on the non-emotion tasks. The findings suggest that autistic individuals have a disability in recognizing bodily expressions of emotion, and that there is a degree of task-specificity to this impairment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":284},"references":34,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
