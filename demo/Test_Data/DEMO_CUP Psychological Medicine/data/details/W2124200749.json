However, these concern planning and strategy use rather than attentional set shifting, which is generally unimpaired. Previous findings in more chronic patients, of severe attentional set shifting impairment, suggest that executive cognitive deficits are progressive during the course of schizophrenia. The finding of severe mnemonic impairment at first episode suggests that cognitive deficits are not restricted to one cognitive domain.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":276},"references":36,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
