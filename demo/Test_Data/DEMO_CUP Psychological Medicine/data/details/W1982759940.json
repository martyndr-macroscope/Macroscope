The associated rises in pulse rate, blood pressure and plasma free fatty acids could be prevented by β-blockade with oxprenolol. This inhibition of the peripheral effects of catecholamines did not affect subjective satisfaction, indicating that central effects or other rewards are more important reinforcers. It is suggested that noradrenaline release in the hypothalamus is the final common pathway to pleasure in many situations, including smoking.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":26},"references":23,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
