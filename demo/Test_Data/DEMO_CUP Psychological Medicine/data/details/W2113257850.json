Erythrocyte choline content was not found to be significantly elevated in any of the groups studied, except in patients taking lithium. Choline influx into the erythrocytes of healthy controls was found to decrease with increasing age, while choline influx into lithiated erythrocytes increased with increasing age in patients. An inverse relationship between erythrocyte choline influx and content was found to exist only in the erythrocytes of elderly healthy volunteers (≥ 60 years old).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":5},"references":17,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
