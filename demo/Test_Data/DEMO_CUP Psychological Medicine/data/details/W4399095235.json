We thus examined changes in BED diagnostic status in a prospective, community-based study that was larger and more representative with respect to sex, age of onset, and body mass index (BMI) than prior multi-year prospective studies. Methods Probands and relatives with current DSM-IV BED ( n = 156) from a family study of BED (‘baseline’) were selected for follow-up at 2.5 and 5 years. Probands were required to have BMI &gt; 25 (women) or &gt;27 (men). Diagnostic interviews and questionnaires were administered at all timepoints. Results Of participants with follow-up data ( n = 137), 78.1% were female, and 11.7% and 88.3% reported identifying as Black and White, respectively. At baseline, their mean age was 47.2 years, and mean BMI was 36.1. At 2.5 (and 5) years, 61.3% (45.7%), 23.4% (32.6%), and 15.3% (21.7%) of assessed participants exhibited full, sub-threshold, and no BED, respectively. No participants displayed anorexia or bulimia nervosa at follow-up timepoints. Median time to remission (i.e. no BED) exceeded 60 months, and median time to relapse (i.e. sub-threshold or full BED) after remission was 30 months. Two classes of machine learning methods did not consistently outperform random guessing at predicting time to remission from baseline demographic and clinical variables. Conclusions Among community-based adults with higher BMI, BED improves with time, but full remission often takes many years, and relapse is common.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":3},"references":50,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
