The study aimed to establish which relaxation technique, among six, is the most feasible in first-line medical health workers wearing medical protective equipment. Methods This was a two-step study collecting data with online surveys. Step 1: 15 first-line medical health workers were trained to use six different relaxation techniques and reported the two most feasible techniques while wearing medical protective equipment. Step 2: the most two feasible relaxation techniques revealed by step 1 were quantitatively tested in a sample of 65 medical health workers in terms of efficacy, no space limitation, no time limitation, no body position requirement, no environment limitation to be done, easiness to learn, simplicity, convenience, practicality, and acceptance. Results Kegel exercise and autogenic relaxation were the most feasible techniques according to step 1. In step 2, Kegel exercise outperformed autogenic relaxation on all the 10 dimensions among the 65 participants while wearing medical protective equipment (efficacy: 24 v . 15, no space limitation: 30 v . 4, no time limitation: 31 v . 4, no body position requirement: 26 v . 4, no environment limitation: 30 v . 11, easiness to learn: 28 v . 5, simplicity: 29 v . 7, convenience: 29 v . 4, practicality: 30 v . 14, acceptance: 32 v . 6). Conclusion Kegel exercise seems a promising self-relaxation technique for first-line medical health workers while wearing medical protective equipment among COVID-19 pandemic.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":4},"references":35,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
