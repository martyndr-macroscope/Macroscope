There was a specific difference in lateral ventricular area between these two groups but it accounted for only 11% of the variance in this measure. In contrast, racial and sexual differences in the ventricular-brain ratio (VBR) related to differences in intra-cranial area. It is argued that analysis of variance, using lateral ventricular area and intra-cranial area, is more informative than VBR in examining these structural changes in functional psychoses.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":38},"references":29,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
