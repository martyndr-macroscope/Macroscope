However, any genetic etiology of such comorbidity and causal relations is poorly understood, especially at the genome-wide level. Methods In the present in silico research, we analyzed summary data from the genome-wide association study of the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium for MDD ( n = 191 005) and UK Biobank for smoking ( n = 337 030) by using various biostatistical methods including Bayesian colocalization analysis, LD score regression, variant effect size correlation analysis, and Mendelian randomization (MR). Results By adopting a gene prioritization approach, we identified 43 genes shared by MDD and smoking, which were significantly enriched in membrane potential, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor activity, and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathways, indicating that the comorbid mechanisms are involved in the neurotransmitter system. According to linkage disequilibrium score regression, we found a strong positive correlation between MDD and current smoking ( r g = 0.365; p = 7.23 × 10 −25 ) and a negative correlation between MDD and former smoking ( r g = −0.298; p = 1.59 × 10 −24 ). MR analysis suggested that genetic liability for depression increased smoking. Conclusions These findings inform the concomitant conditions of MDD and smoking and support the use of self-medication with smoking to counteract depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":29},"references":66,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
