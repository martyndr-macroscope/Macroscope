Various measures of depression and anxiety showed a pattern of interrelationships which suggested that they were measuring a general state of dysphoria rather than separate dimensions of anxiety and depression. Dysphoria was found to be more reliably related to level of positive symptomatology than to negative symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":56},"references":50,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
