The current diagnostic classifications are not helpful to address this issue, and there is conflicting evidence in favor and against either model. In practice, though, understanding that many patients may show a progressive cognitive and functional decline which may be correlated with the number and severity of episodes may lead to better outcomes through early intervention strategies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":9},"references":22,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
