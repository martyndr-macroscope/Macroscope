In comparison to 10 normal controls and to 30 patients not experiencing Schneiderian symptoms, the target group had great difficulty in keeping track of their performance and remembering what actions they had made. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Schneiderian symptoms (such as delusions of alien control) are associated with impairments in the central monitoring of action.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":149},"references":17,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
