Interventions based on trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy have shown promising results to facilitate recovery. The current trial evaluated whether a novel, scalable and digital early version of the intervention, Condensed Internet-Delivered Prolonged Exposure (CIPE), is effective in reducing post-traumatic stress symptoms. Method A single-site randomised controlled trial with self-referred adults ( N = 102) exposed to trauma within the last 2 months. The participants were randomised to 3 weeks of CIPE or a waiting list (WL) for 7 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 1–3 (primary endpoint), week 4–7 (secondary endpoint) and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Results The main analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle indicated statistically significant reductions in symptoms of post-traumatic stress in the CIPE group as compared to the WL group. The between-group effect size was moderate at week 3 (bootstrapped d = 0.70; 95% CI 0.33–1.06) and large at week 7 (bootstrapped d = 0.83; 95% CI 0.46–1.19). Results in the intervention group were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. No severe adverse events were found. Conclusions CIPE is a scalable intervention that may confer early benefits on post-traumatic stress symptoms in survivors of trauma. The next step is to compare this intervention to an active control group and also investigate its effects when implemented in regular care.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":12},"references":49,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
