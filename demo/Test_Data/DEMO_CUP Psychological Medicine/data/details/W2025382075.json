This hypothesis is based on the following findings: (1) Catalepsy, which is the nearest equivalent in animals to human catatonia, develops in cats when prostaglandin E 1 is injected into the cerebral ventricles and when during endotoxin or lipid A fever the prostaglandin E 2 level in cisternal c.s.f. rises to high levels; however, when fever and prostaglandin level are brought down by non-steroid anti-pyretics which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, catalepsy disappears as well. (2) Febrile episodes are a genuine syndrome of schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":61},"references":57,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
