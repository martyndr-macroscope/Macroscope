However, in 1980, the University of Verona established a Chair in Medical Psychology and since that time a separate department gradually developed. This department, primarily devoted to epidemiological studies in mental health and to teaching activities, was later involved also in clinical work and was officially recognized by the Regional Health Department and by the Local Socio Health authorities (ULSS No. 25, Verona), as Servizio di Psicologia Medica . They provided additional financial support and new infrastructures not only for its clinical activities but also for research carried out in its Research Unit.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":10},"references":60,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
