The two-week prevalence of psychotropic drug consumption was found to be 13%. The prevalence was higher in women (18%) than in men (9%). The most commonly consumed category of psychotropic drugs were the benzodiazepines, which accounted for 70% of all the psychotropic drugs consumed by women and 85% of those consumed by men. Using a logistic analysis, a strong association between drug consumption and minor psychiatric morbidity, as indicated by the GHQ scores, was found for both sexes, a finding not significantly different from that found in the West London study by Murray et al. (1981). Alcohol abuse in men was less prevalent in the youngest age-group. Thirty-three (19%) of the male GHQ low scorers were alcohol abusers, compared with 12 (40%) of the high scorers. No significant association was found between psychotropic drug consumption and alcohol abuse in men.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":32},"references":24,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
