To have four papers (Bower et al . 2003; Proudfoot et al . 2003; Simpson et al . 2003; Gabbay et al . 2003) within a single issue of a leading psychiatry journal is indeed unusual. Together these four major papers provide evidence of the benefits and limitations of psychological interventions for common mental disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":19},"references":23,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
