The biological basis for this is unknown. It has been proposed that non-demented adults with DS may undergo accelerated brain ageing. Method We used volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and manual tracing to compare brain anatomy and ageing in 39 non-demented adults with DS and 42 healthy controls. Results Individuals with DS had significant differences in brain anatomy. Furthermore, individuals with DS had a significantly greater age-related reduction in volume of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, and a significantly greater age-related increase in volume of peripheral cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Conclusions Non-demented adults with DS have differences in brain anatomy and ‘accelerated’ ageing of some brain regions. This may increase their risk for age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":53},"references":33,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
