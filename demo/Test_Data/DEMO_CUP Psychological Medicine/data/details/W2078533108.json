These results are similar to those found in normal women and lend support both to the validity of the concept of hysterical personality and to the idea that men and women experience fluctuations of mood in a similar way.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":7},"references":16,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
