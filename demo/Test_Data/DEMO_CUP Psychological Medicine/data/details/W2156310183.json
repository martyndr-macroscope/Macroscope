Results were analysed by the method of check-style analysis and by a comparison of concept profiles for the 2 groups using a multivariate analysis program. A highly significant difference ( p &lt; 0·001) was found between the check-styles of dialysis and control groups. The implications of this finding are discussed. Three concepts were selected for particular study: ‘my self’, ‘my ideal self’ and ‘people’. There were significant differences in profiles between the 2 groups on all 3 concepts. Subgroup analysis showed further differences for sex, age and length of time on dialysis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":5},"references":8,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
