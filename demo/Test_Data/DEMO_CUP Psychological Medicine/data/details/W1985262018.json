In phase 1, a random sample of 3232 persons answered the GHQ–30 (response rate:75%). In phase 2,486 of the respondents were interviewed withthe full PSE within two weeks. The relationship of PSE-‘caseness’ (ID ≥ 5) and GHQ score was expressed in a logistic regression model, the parameters of which showed strong agreement with the Canberra results, for all socio-demographic variables examined, except for urbanization. means of the logistic model the point-prevalence of PSE cases was calculated at 7·3% (range5·5%-9·2%). Prevalence did not differ significantly in men and women. Higher case rates were found in age category of 55–59 years, among divorced and widowed persons, the lower educational and occupational levels, the unemployed, chronically ill and unable to work, and with city people. This study adds further evidence to a growing body of epidemiological data suggesting similar rates and patterns of psychiatric disorder in populations in industrialized countries.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":16,"cited_by_count":100},"references":32,"networkCitations":16,"seed":false}
