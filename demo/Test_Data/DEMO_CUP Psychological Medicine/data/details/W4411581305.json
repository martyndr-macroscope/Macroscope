However, no research has examined how identity and diagnosis may interact to shape the treatment experiences of under-resourced youth with psychiatric conditions. Applying an intersectional lens to treatment disparities is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote equitable care. Methods Analyses included youth ages 7–18 with eating disorders (EDs; n = 3,311), mood/anxiety disorders ( n = 3,219), or psychotic disorders ( n = 3,035) enrolled in California Medicaid. Using state billing records, we examined sex- and race and ethnicity-based disparities in receipt of core services – outpatient therapy, outpatient medical care, and inpatient treatment – in the first year after diagnosis and potential differences across diagnostic groups. Results Many youth (50.7% across diagnoses) received no outpatient therapy, and youth with EDs were least likely to receive these services. Youth of color received fewer days of outpatient therapy than White youth, and Latinx youth received fewer therapy and medical services across outpatient and inpatient contexts. Sex- and race and ethnicity-based disparities were especially pronounced for youth with EDs, with particularly low levels of service receipt among boys and Latinx youth with EDs. Conclusions Results raise concerns for unmet treatment needs among publicly insured youth, which are exacerbated for youth with multiple marginalized identities and those who do not conform to historical stereotypes of affected individuals (e.g., low-income boys of color with EDs). Targeted efforts are needed to ensure equitable care.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":54,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
