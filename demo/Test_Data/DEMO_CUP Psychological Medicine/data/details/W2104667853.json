All subjects were rated at baseline and after 12 months on the Life Skills Profile (LSP), a 39-item measure of disability, with scores demonstrating moderate stability. The baseline LSP score was a significant predictor of readmission, both in univariate and multivariate analyses. By contrast, several univariate variables (e.g. unemployment and non-compliance with medication over the review period) did not maintain their predictive capacity in multivariate analyses, suggesting that they were manifestations or consequences of significant disability, rather than independent contributors to poor outcome.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":50},"references":4,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
