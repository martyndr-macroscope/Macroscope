The bipolar group appeared no different from the controls, and both of these groups had significantly larger cerebral and cortical volumes than the schizophrenics. Our previous report of a significantly reduced cortical volume in the schizophrenic group, with a corresponding increase in the volume of sulcal fluid is, therefore, not a generalized feature of psychotic illness but may be more specific to schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":202},"references":55,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
