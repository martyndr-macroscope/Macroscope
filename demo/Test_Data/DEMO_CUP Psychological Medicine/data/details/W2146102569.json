This paper reports the prevalence, disability, sociodemographic and clinical association of psychiatric morbidity among attenders in general health care in Taiwan where, as in the rest of non-Western countries, few studies have been carried out. Methods. A cross-sectional survey with a two-phase design was carried out at out-patient clinics of three health stations and a general hospital. Results. A total of 990 patients completed the brief screen in the first phase, 486 of whom completed the independent assessment in the second phase. The proportion of screening positives was 46·0% and the weighted prevalence of definite psychiatric disorder was 38·2%. Common mental disorders were associated with female gender and unemployment. Housewives, students and patients with higher educational attainment were at lower risk of having alcohol use disorders. Patients with common mental disorders were more likely to present with psychological complaints, to attribute their illness to psychosocial causes and to perceive their mental and physical health as poor. Psychiatric morbidity was associated with excess life events. Common mental disorders, particularly depressive disorders, were significantly associated with self-reported disability. Conclusions. Psychiatric morbidity is a major health problem in general health care in Taiwan. Physicians should be aware of these health problems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":37},"references":14,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
