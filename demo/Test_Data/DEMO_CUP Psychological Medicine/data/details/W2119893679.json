The differences were significant both for daughters with hysteria plus sociopathy and for daughters with hysteria without sociopathy. The association was independent of assortative mating between sociopathic men and women with hysteria or sociopathy.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":25},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
