The use of pharmacological tools for manipulating levels of chemical transmitters is referred to briefly, but particular attention is given to the problems of studying the function of these pathways with lesion techniques. Noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) are selected for detailed consideration and experimental evidence reviewed, suggesting that these two catecholamines in the forebrain serve different functions: NA with processes of attention essential for learning, and DA with the execution of appropriate responses. Hypotheses suggesting dysfunction of forebrain DA and NA systems in schizophrenia are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":23},"references":47,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
