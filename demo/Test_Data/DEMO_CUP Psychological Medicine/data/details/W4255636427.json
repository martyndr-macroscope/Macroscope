First, we are pleased to announce a further increase in size. Pressure of excellent quality manuscript submissions continues to grow, and this year sees a modest increase in size with each issue around 256 pages. With an earlier increase from four to six issues per year, this represents 40% growth in the total size of each volume in the last 3 years. We recognize the importance of keeping publication delays short, and also the importance of maintaining high quality. The new increase in pages will allow only a modest increase in our current acceptance rate, without loss of these ideals, and the annual volume size is now substantial. Secondly, we adopt structured abstracts with this issue. This format has become widespread in the last few years. It is better suited to the electronic databases, which are essential for the modern scientist and scholar, and to the various forms of electronic publishing, which are supplementing, but not supplanting, the printed page. We are proud of the literary style of our authors and we hope that the structured format can still accommodate it.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
