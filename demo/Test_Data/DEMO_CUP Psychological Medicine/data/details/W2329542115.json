In the current study we examine the influence of both DUP and duration of untreated illness (DUI) on symptoms and functioning at 5 years follow-up while controlling for other early characteristics. Method A total of 132 patients with first-episode psychosis and treated in an early intervention program were prospectively followed up for 5 years. Outcomes assessed included positive and negative symptoms, overall functioning, weeks on disability pension and weeks of full-time competitive employment. Results While DUP showed a significant correlation with level of positive symptoms at follow-up, this was not independent of pre-morbid social adjustment. DUI emerged as a more robust independent predictor of negative symptoms, social and occupational functioning and use of a disability pension. Conclusions Delay between onset of non-specific symptoms and treatment may be a more important influence on long-term functioning for first-episode patients than DUP. This suggests the possible value of treating such signs and symptoms as early as possible regardless of the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing likelihood or severity of psychotic symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":31},"references":58,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
