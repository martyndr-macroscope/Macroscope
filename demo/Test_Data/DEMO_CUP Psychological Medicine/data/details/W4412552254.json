Gyrification, a measure of cortical integrity sensitive to events occurring during the prenatal and perinatal periods, is also altered in first-episode psychosis (FEP). We examined the relationship between OCs and gyrification in FEP, as well as whether gyrification mediates the relationship between OCs and cognition. Methods We examined differences in the Local Gyrification Index (LGI) for the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and cingulate cortices between 139 FEP patients and 125 healthy controls (HCs). Regression analyses explored whether OCs and diagnosis interact to explain LGI variation. Parametric mediation analyses were conducted to assess the effect of LGI on the relationship between OCs and cognition for FEP and HC. Results Significant LGI differences were observed between FEP patients and HC in the left parietal and bilateral cingulate and occipital cortices. There was a significant interaction between OCs and diagnosis on the left cingulate cortex (LCC) that was specific to males ( p = 0.04) and was driven by gestational rather than intrauterine OCs. In HCs, OCs had a direct effect on working memory (WM) ( p = 0.048) in the mediation analysis, whereas in FEP, we observed no significant effect of OCs on either verbal or WM. Conclusions OCs interact with diagnosis to predict LCC gyrification, such that males with FEP exposed to OCs exhibit the lowest LGI. OCs influence WM, and LCC gyrification may mediate this relation only in HC, suggesting a differential neurodevelopmental process in psychosis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":0},"references":87,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
