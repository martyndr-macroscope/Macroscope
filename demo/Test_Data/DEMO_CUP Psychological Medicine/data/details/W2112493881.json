The initial level of depression affected the accuracy of recall. Unexpectedly, patients who were more depressed initially had more accurate recall, particularly for biological and symptomatically negative items of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":37},"references":15,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
