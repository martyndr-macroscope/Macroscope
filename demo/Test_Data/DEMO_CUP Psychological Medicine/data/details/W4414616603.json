Our objective is to explore the functional connectivity pattern underlying PmD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods A total of 150 patients with MDD and 91 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. The patients were categorized into psychomotor (pMDD, n = 107) and non-psychomotor (npMDD, n = 43) groups based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Seed-based connectivity (SBC) analysis was conducted using predefined somatomotor and cerebellar network (SMN and CN) coordinates as seeds, to assess group differences and symptom correlations. Subsequently, we correlated the group-contrast SBC map with existing neurotransmitter maps to explore the neurochemical basis. Results In pMDD patients compared to HC, we observed decreased connectivity, especially between the SMN and frontal cortex, within the bilateral SMN, and between the CN and right precentral cortex. Meanwhile, connectivity increased between the SMN and the middle cingulate cortex and between the CN and left precentral cortex in pMDD relative to npMDD and HC. Connectivity between the SMN and angular gyrus was positively correlated with the severity of PmD. Additionally, the aberrant SBC patterns in pMDD were linked to the distribution of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. Conclusions This study provides insights into the aberrant connectivity within the motor circuits and its interactions with non-motor regions in PmD. It also suggests a potential role for dopaminergic dysregulation in the connectivity abnormalities associated with PmD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":46,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
