Treatment of MDD typically relies on trial-and-error to find an effective approach. Identifying early response-related biomarkers that predict response to antidepressants would help clinicians to decide, as early as possible, whether a particular treatment might be suitable for a given patient. Methods Data were from the two-stage Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial. A whole-brain, voxel-wise, mixed-effects model was applied to identify early-treatment cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes as biomarkers of treatment response. We examined changes in CBF measured with arterial spin labeling 1-week after initiating double-masked sertraline/placebo. We tested whether these early 1-week scans could be used to predict response observed after 8-weeks of treatment. Results Response to 8-week placebo treatment was associated with increased cerebral perfusion in temporal cortex and reduced cerebral perfusion in postcentral region captured at 1-week of treatment. Additionally, CBF response in these brain regions was significantly correlated with improvement in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score in the placebo group. No significant associations were found for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment. Conclusions We conclude that early CBF responses to placebo administration in multiple brain regions represent candidate neural biomarkers of longer-term antidepressant effects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":66,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
