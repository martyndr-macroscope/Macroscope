Family and sociocultural variables are discussed, and experimental paradigms noted. Directions for further research are suggested in these areas, including perceptual and physiological reflex mechanisms triggered in neurosis and in normal people, cross-cultural longitudinal epidemiological studies of specific neurotic syndromes which are linked to family and social variables, factors governing illness behaviour, and field observations of family and marital pathology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":12},"references":122,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
