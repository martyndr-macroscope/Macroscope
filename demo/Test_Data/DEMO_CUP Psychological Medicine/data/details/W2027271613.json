This hypothesis is examined in the light of the author's 15-year follow-up study of women with early breast cancer and of other pertinent studies. The available evidence supports the hypothesis in respect of certain earlystage non-metastatic cancers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":170},"references":37,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
