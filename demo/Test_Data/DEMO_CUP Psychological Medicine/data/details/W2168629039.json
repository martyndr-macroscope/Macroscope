In this paper the differential impact of each of a group of interviewers on the responses obtained in an epidemiological survey is examined. The effect is measured and its impact on the interpretation of individual responses, scale scores and model fitting is shown.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":12},"references":18,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
