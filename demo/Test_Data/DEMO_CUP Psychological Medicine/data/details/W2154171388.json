A rating of physical symptomatology and an enquiry into the childhood and psychosocial background were made at the same time. Psychiatric morbidity, physical symptomatology and a history of good relationships with both natural parents in childhood were inter-related. They were all related to survival on haemodialysis 3½ years later. Survival was also associated with a coping spouse and full-time employment or housework by the patient. These findings are discussed in the light of current concepts of the psychosocial setting for physical illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":39},"references":14,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
