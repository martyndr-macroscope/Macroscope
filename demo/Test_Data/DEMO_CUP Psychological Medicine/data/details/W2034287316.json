Personality status was assessed independently using a structured interview, the Personality Assessment Schedule. One hundred and ninety-eight patients had personality assessments, 89% with a close informant. Thirty-six per cent had a personality disorder and these patients had more severe psychopathology than those with no personality disorder. Personality disorder was more common in patients with dysthymic disorder and this group responded less well to treatment. The category of personality disorder had no apparent influence on symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":66},"references":36,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
