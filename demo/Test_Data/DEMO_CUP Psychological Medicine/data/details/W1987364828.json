Results indicated that the effects of MND on everyday functioning accounted for incidence of depression and low self-esteem. Acceptance of illness was related to severity of symptoms and was a significant factor irrespective of level of physical symptomatology. Ways of coping with the illness did not relate in any significant way to severity of symptoms. Mild physical impairments were associated with an ‘internal’ view of control over health.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":116},"references":35,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
