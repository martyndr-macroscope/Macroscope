Methods We analyzed health conditions data from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) (age = 17; N = 19,239), the National Child Development Study (NCDS) (age = 44; N = 9293), and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) (age ≥ 50; N = 7585). The fit of three Confirmatory Factor models was used to select the optimal solution by Comparative Fit Index, Tucker-Lewis Index, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation. The relationship among d factor, lifestyles, and well-being was further explored. Results Supporting the existence of the d factor, the bi-factor model showed the best model fit in 17-year-olds (MCS:CFI = 0.97, TFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.01), 44-year-olds (NCDS:CFI = 0.96, TFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.02), and 50+ year-olds (ELSA:CFI = 0.97, TFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.02). The d factor scores significantly correlated with lifestyle and well-being, suggesting healthier lifestyles were associated with a reduced likelihood of physical and mental health comorbidities, which in turn improved well-being. Conclusions Contrary to the traditional dichotomy between mental and physical conditions, our study showed a general factor underlying the comorbidity across mental and physical diseases, related to lifestyle and well-being. Our results inform the conceptualization of mental and physical illness as well as future research assessing risk and pathways of disease transmission, intervention, and prevention. Our results also provide a strong rationale for a systematic screening for mental disorders in individuals with physical conditions and vice versa, and for integrated services addressing multimorbidity.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":54,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
