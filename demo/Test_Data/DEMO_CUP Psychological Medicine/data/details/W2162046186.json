Goitre was found in 37 %, exophthalmos in 23 %, positive thyroid auto-antibodies in 24 % and abnormal TRH tests in 49 %. It would appear that thyroid failure due to lithium is usually dependent on antibody mediated damage. It is unlikely that lithium has a direct effect on the hypothalamic–pituitary axis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":108},"references":49,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
