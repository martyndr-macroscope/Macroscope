The structure of depression found in the general population showed strong similarities to that found in the psychiatric population. There were, however, important differences. Four substantial syndromes of depression were identified: ‘anxiety depression’, ‘cognitive depression’, ‘vegetative depression’ and depression characterized by the classic endogenous triad of diurnal variations, early wakening, and weight loss. These syndromes were essentially independent for this sample. Examination of component score distributions suggested that people simultaneously experience differing degrees of each syndrome. It was concluded that depression was most parsimoniously classified in dimensional rather than categorical terms within this sample.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":30},"references":59,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
