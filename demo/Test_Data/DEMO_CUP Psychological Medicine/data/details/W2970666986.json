In contrast, person-centered approaches develop profiles of factors and these profiles can be examined as predictors of onset. Here, we developed profiles of adolescent psychosocial and clinical functioning among adolescents without a history of major depression. Methods Data come from a subsample of participants from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project who completed self-report measures of functioning in adolescence and completed diagnostic and self-report measures at follow-up assessments up to approximately 15 years after baseline. Results We identified four profiles of psychosocial and clinical functioning: Thriving; Average Functioning; Externalizing Vulnerability and Family Stress and Internalizing Vulnerability at the baseline assessment of participants without a history of depression at the initial assessment in mid-adolescence. Classes differed in the likelihood of onset and course of depressive disorders, experience of later anxiety and substance use disorders, and psychosocial functioning in adulthood. Moreover, the predictive utility of these classes was maintained when controlling for multiple other established risk factors for depressive disorders. Conclusions This work highlights the utility of examining multiple factors simultaneously to understand risk for depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":6},"references":56,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
