Six children born to ‘registered’ narcotic addicts were studied, and particular attention was paid to any signs of narcotic withdrawal that might occur after birth. Although all the mothers took heroin or methadone regularly up to the time of delivery, minor physical signs which might have been considered part of the withdrawal syndrome occurred in only one baby. The absence of major withdrawal signs found in this study contrasts with previous findings. The reasons for these differences are discussed, and the implications of these observations for the management of the pregnant narcotic addict and her newborn infant are considered.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":51},"references":33,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
