The attrition rate for this group, and the accumulation of ‘new’ long-stay patients from the area since that date, are analysed, and compared with published data from other studies. In the light of the resulting overall decrease in the long-stay population with time, possible trends in the future can be considered.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":49},"references":22,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
