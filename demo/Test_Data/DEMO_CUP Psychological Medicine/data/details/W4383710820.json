A number of experimental studies have been conducted that attempt to induce, manipulate or measure paranoid thinking in both clinical and nonclinical populations, which is important to understand causal mechanisms and advance psychological interventions. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies (non-sleep, non-drug paradigms) on psychometrically assessed paranoia in clinical and nonclinical populations. The review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. Six databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Medline and AMED) were searched for peer-reviewed experimental studies using within and between-subject designs to investigate paranoia in clinical and nonclinical populations. Effect sizes for each study were calculated using Hedge's g and were integrated using a random effect meta-analysis model. Thirty studies were included in the review (total n = 3898), which used 13 experimental paradigms to induce paranoia; 10 studies set out to explicitly induce paranoia, and 20 studies induced a range of other states. Effect sizes for individual studies ranged from 0.03 to 1.55. Meta-analysis found a significant summary effect of 0.51 [95% confidence interval 0.37–0.66, p &lt; 0.001], indicating a medium effect of experimental paradigms on paranoia. Paranoia can be induced and investigated using a wide range of experimental paradigms, which can inform decision-making about which paradigms to use in future studies, and is consistent with cognitive, continuum and evolutionary models of paranoia.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":9},"references":84,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
