Follow-up studies of the re-conviction in the subsequent 24 years and 15 years of those found guilty of rape, incest, and unlawful sexual intercourse with girls under 13 in 1951 and 1961 have therefore been made. The present paper deals with those prosecuted for unlawful sexual intercourse with girls under 13. The results suggest that there is a low but more persistent tendency to re-conviction than is found in property offenders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":35},"references":10,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
