Women were interviewed at 16 weeks gestation. Those receiving high feedback were more likely to report that they had acted on health advice given at the first antenatal visit to reduce their smoking and drinking.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":88},"references":21,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
