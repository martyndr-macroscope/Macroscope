The symptom profiles of the two groups were similar. The profiles of temporal lobe and other epileptics were also similar. Epileptic patients with a high current psychiatric morbidity were characterized by a raised incidence of previous neurotic illness and raised neuroticism scores on the Eysenck Personality Inventory.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":130},"references":20,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
