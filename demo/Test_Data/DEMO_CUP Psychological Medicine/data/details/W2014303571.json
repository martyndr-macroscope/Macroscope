Method The analytic sample consisted of all persons 16–30 years old and living in Sweden who were granted a disability pension in the years 1995–1997; 2000–2002 as well as 2005–2006 ( n = 26 624). Crude risks and adjusted odds ratios for suicide attempt were computed for the 9-year window around the year of disability pension receipt by repeated-measures logistic regressions. Results The risk of suicide attempt was found to increase continuously up to the year preceding the granting of disability pension in young people, after which the risk declined. These trajectories were similar for women and men and for disability pension due to mental and somatic diagnoses. Still, the multivariate odds ratios for suicide attempts for women and for disability pension due to mental disorders were 2.5- and 3.8-fold increased compared with the odds ratios for men and disability pension due to somatic disorders, respectively. Trajectories of suicide attempts differed for young individuals granted a disability pension during 2005–2006 compared with those granted during 1995–1997 and 2000–2002. Conclusions We found an increasing risk of suicide attempt up until the granting of a disability pension in young individuals, after which the risk decreased. It is of clinical importance to monitor suicide attempt risk among young people waiting for the granting of a disability pension.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":13},"references":27,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
