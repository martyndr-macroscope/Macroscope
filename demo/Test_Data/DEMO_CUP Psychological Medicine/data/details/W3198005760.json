Specifying a link between delayed gastric emptying and self-induced vomiting could offer new insights into the pathophysiology of purging disorder (PD). Methods Women ( N = 95) recruited from the community meeting criteria for DSM-5 BN who purged ( n = 26), BN with nonpurging compensatory behaviors ( n = 18), PD ( n = 25), or healthy control women ( n = 26) completed assessments of gastric emptying, gut peptides, and subjective responses over the course of a standardized test meal under two conditions administered in a double-blind, crossover sequence: placebo and 10 mg of metoclopramide. Results Delayed gastric emptying was associated with purging with no main or moderating effects of binge eating in the placebo condition. Medication eliminated group differences in gastric emptying but did not alter group differences in reported gastrointestinal distress. Exploratory analyses revealed that medication caused increased postprandial PYY release, which predicted elevated gastrointestinal distress. Conclusions Delayed gastric emptying demonstrates a specific association with purging behaviors. However, correcting disruptions in gastric emptying may exacerbate disruptions in gut peptide responses specifically linked to the presence of purging after normal amounts of food.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":45,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
