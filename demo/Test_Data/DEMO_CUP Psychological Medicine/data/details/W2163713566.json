Results showed an association between both trait and state measures of mood and headache occurrence, and between trait and state measures of headache occurrence and illusion susceptibility. However, mood and illusion susceptibility did not appear themselves to be associated either as trait or state variables. The implications of these results for remediation of headaches are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":41},"references":17,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
