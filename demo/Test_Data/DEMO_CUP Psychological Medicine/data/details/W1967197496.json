The correlation matrices of five different randomization indices were used to study within group variation; these matrices were similar for the normal and alcoholic groups, but very different for the schizophrenic group. The differences between the three groups were studied by canonical analysis and, in terms of the canonical variables, the mean performance of the normal group is clearly discriminated from that of the alcoholic and schizophrenic subjects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":54},"references":11,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
