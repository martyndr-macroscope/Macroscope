Previous reports of increased T 1 time in the basal ganglia were not confirmed, and group differences were not detected within the white matter. Within patients T 1 values could not be related to tardive dyskinesia or other clinical features. Normal variation seen in basal ganglia T 1 times is described for the first time: lowest values occur in the globus pallidus and highest in the caudate, and values within the putamen increase rostrally.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":24},"references":36,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
