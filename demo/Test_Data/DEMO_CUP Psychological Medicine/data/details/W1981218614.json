In a paired comparison of patients with reactive and endogenous depression (matched for age and sex), the GH response to clonidine was less in the endogenous member of the pair in 8 out of 10 cases. These findings are interpreted as evidence of a defect at alpha 2 adrenoceptors in neuroendocrine systems in endogenous as compared with reactive depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":67},"references":22,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
