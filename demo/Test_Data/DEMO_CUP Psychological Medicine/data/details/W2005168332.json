We suggest that it is important to use alternative models (multiplicative and additive) to examine data, to investigate the match between stressors and social resources, and to investigate fully whether detected interactions actually represent a buffering effect.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":68},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
