Here, we tested the beneficial effect of sleep on memory consolidation following exposure psychotherapy of phobic anxiety. Method A total of 40 individuals afflicted with spider phobia according to DSM-IV underwent a one-session virtual reality exposure treatment and either slept for 90 min or stayed awake afterwards. Results Sleep following exposure therapy compared with wakefulness led to better reductions in self-reported fear ( p = 0.045, d = 0.47) and catastrophic spider-related cognitions ( p = 0.026, d = 0.53) during approaching a live spider, both tested after 1 week. Both reductions were associated with greater percentages of stage 2 sleep. Conclusions Our results indicate that sleep following successful psychotherapy, such as exposure therapy, improves therapeutic effectiveness, possibly by strengthening new non-fearful memory traces established during therapy. These findings offer an important non-invasive alternative to recent attempts to facilitate therapeutic memory extinction and consolidation processes with pharmacological or behavioral interventions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":109},"references":62,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
