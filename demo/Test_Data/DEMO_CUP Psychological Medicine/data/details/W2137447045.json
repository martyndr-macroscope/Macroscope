The PHS/PSE interview enables a rating of ‘lifetime ever’ psychopathology to be performed. It provides good inter-rater reliability, as well as a satisfactory agreement between retrospective interviews and casenote-based assessment of past psychopathology. The PHS has been devised specifically for use in a family-genetic study of affective illness, but the general approach may be applicable to other categories of psychiatric disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":140},"references":9,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
