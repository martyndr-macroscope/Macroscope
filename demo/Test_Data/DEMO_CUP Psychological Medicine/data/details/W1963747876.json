Data for 160 DSM-III schizophrenics and a family member were obtained regarding attitudes towards treatment, tolerance of symptomatic deviance, and one-year rehospitalization and lengths of hospital stay. Findings suggest that ill sons may be sent to hospital more often and remain in hospital longer than ill daughters, in part due to social norms and expectations of parents associated with gender.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":39},"references":39,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
