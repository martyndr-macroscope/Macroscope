However, these findings have been not always consistent because of ADHD diversity. This study aimed to identify ADHD subtypes based on cognitive function and find their distinct brain structural characteristics. Methods Using the data of 656 children with ADHD from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we applied unsupervised machine learning to identify ADHD subtypes using the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Tasks. Moreover, we compared the regional brain volumes between each ADHD subtype and 6601 children without ADHD (non-ADHD). Results Hierarchical cluster analysis automatically classified ADHD into three distinct subtypes: ADHD-A ( n = 212, characterized by high-order cognitive ability), ADHD-B ( n = 190, characterized by low cognitive control, processing speed, and episodic memory), and ADHD-C ( n = 254, characterized by strikingly low cognitive control, working memory, episodic memory, and language ability). Structural analyses revealed that the ADHD-C type had significantly smaller volumes of the left inferior temporal gyrus and right lateral orbitofrontal cortex than the non-ADHD group, and the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex volume was positively correlated with language performance in the ADHD-C type. However, the volumes of the ADHD-A and ADHD-B types were not significantly different from those of the non-ADHD group. Conclusions These results indicate the presence of anomalies in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex associated with language deficits in the ADHD-C type. Subtype specificity may explain previous inconsistencies in brain structural anomalies reported in ADHD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":96,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
