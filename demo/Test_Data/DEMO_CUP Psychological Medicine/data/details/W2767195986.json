The aims of the present study were to examine the effects of relaxation techniques compared to cognitive and behavioural therapies in reducing anxiety symptoms, and whether they have comparable efficacy across disorders. Method We conducted a meta-analysis of 50 studies (2801 patients) comparing relaxation training with cognitive and behavioural treatments of anxiety. Results The overall effect size (ES) across all anxiety outcomes, with only one combined ES in each study, was g = −0.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.41 to −0.13], favouring cognitive and behavioural therapies (number needed to treat = 6.61). However, no significant difference between relaxation and cognitive and behavioural therapies was found for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and specific phobias (considering social anxiety and specific phobias separately). Heterogeneity was moderate ( I 2 = 52; 95% CI = 33–65). The ES was significantly associated with age ( p &lt; 0.001), hours of cognitive and/or behavioural therapy ( p = 0.015), quality of intervention ( p = 0.007), relaxation treatment format ( p &lt; 0.001) and type of disorder ( p = 0.008), explaining an 82% of variance. Conclusions Relaxation seems to be less effective than cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder and it might also be less effective at 1-year follow-up for panic, but there is no evidence that it is less effective for other anxiety disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":32},"references":42,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
