This study examined the secondary effects of the personality-targeted substance use preventive program Preventure on aggressive behavior from ages 13 to 20. Methods In total, 339 young people from nine independent schools ( M age = 13.03 years, s.d. = 0.47, range = 12–15) who rated highly on one of the four personality traits associated with increased substance use and other emotional/behavioral symptoms (i.e. impulsivity, anxiety sensitivity, sensation seeking, and negative thinking) were included in the analyses ( n = 145 in Preventure, n = 194 in control). Self-report assessments were administered at baseline and follow-up (6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5.5, and 7 years). Overall aggression and subtypes of aggressive behaviors (proactive, reactive) were examined using multilevel mixed-effects analysis accounting for school-level clustering. Results Across the 7-year follow-up period, the average yearly reduction in the frequency of aggressive behaviors ( b = −0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.64 to −0.20; p &lt; 0.001), reactive aggression ( b = −0.22; 95% CI 0.35 to −0.10; p = 0.001), and proactive aggression ( b = −0.14; 95% CI −0.23 to −0.05; p = 0.002) was greater for the Preventure group compared to the control group. Conclusions The study suggests a brief personality-targeted intervention may have long-term impacts on aggression among young people; however, this interpretation is limited by imbalance of sex ratios between study groups.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":43,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
