The study includes both a cross-sectional sample survey ( N = 993) and prospective cohort studies involving psychoses, minor psychiatric morbidity, alcoholism, suicide, and accidental death. The total response rate to the sample survey was 98·3%; respondents were found to be representative. A preliminary analysis found very high rates of death from suicide, accidents and chronic liver and lung disease with a previous history of alcoholism in many of these deaths. Implications of these findings and studies of risk factors of all these health problems and their relationships are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":34},"references":36,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
