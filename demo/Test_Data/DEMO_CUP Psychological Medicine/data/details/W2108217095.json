After weight gain, hormone values rose and two patients spontaneously resumed menstruation. Clomiphene citrate was administered on one or more occasions to five patients, and bleeding was induced in the majority of those whose weight exceeded 80% of standard. In two of these patients an irregular cycle resumed for a brief period thereafter. Clomiphene appeared to be of limited practical value in the mangement of patients with anorexia nervosa, but the study provided some elucidation of the relationship between body weight and the menstrual disturbance in this condition.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":50},"references":14,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
