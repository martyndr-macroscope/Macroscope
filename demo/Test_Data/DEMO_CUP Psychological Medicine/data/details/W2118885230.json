A replication during a later period showed that the rural area had now caught up with the mining area but a difference in sex ratios between the two areas had remained remarkably constant. A sampling survey, using self-assessment of symptoms in random samples, indicated that differential selection into the psychiatric services was likely to be a determining factor.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":22},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
