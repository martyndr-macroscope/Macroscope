The bulimics demonstrated a sustained elevation of plasma beta-endorphin unrelated to glucose ingestion throughout the 5-hour study period. It is hypothesized that such an elevation of beta-endorphin is the result of stress and that it may play an important role in the perpetuation of the binge-vomiting cycle.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":43},"references":47,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
