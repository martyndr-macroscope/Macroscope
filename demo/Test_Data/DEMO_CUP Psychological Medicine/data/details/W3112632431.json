Methods Histories of 21 lifetime phobic fears, coded as four-level ordinal variables (no fear to fear with major interference) were assessed at personal interview in 7514 adults from the Virginia Twin Registry. We estimated Gaussian Graphical Models on individual phobic fears; compared network structures of women and men using the Network Comparison Test; used community detection to determine the number and nature of groups in which phobic fears hang together; and validated the anticipated specific relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia. Results All networks were densely and positively inter-connected; networks of women and men were structurally similar. Our most frequent and stable solution identified four phobic clusters: (i) blood-injection, (ii) social-agoraphobia, (iii) situational, and (iv) animal-disease. Fear of public restrooms and of diseases clustered with animal and not, respectively, social and blood-injury phobias. When added to the network, the three strongest connections with lifetime panic disorder were all agoraphobic fears: being in crowds, going out of the house alone, and being in open spaces Conclusions Using network analyses applied to a large epidemiologic twin sample, we broadly validated the DSM-IV typography but did not entirely support the distinction of agoraphobic and social phobic fears or the DSM placements for fears of public restrooms and diseases. We found strong support for the specificity of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobic fears.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":15},"references":51,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
