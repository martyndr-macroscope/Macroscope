However, the generalization of the findings to real-world patients is limited due to inherent caveats of the RCT. We aimed to investigate the treatment discontinuation and risk of psychiatric hospitalization using a nationwide population database. Methods The Health Insurance Review Agency database in South Korea was obtained, and the observation period started from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2016. We defined the maintenance period as the period from 6-month after the diagnosis of schizophrenia, which is utilized for the main results. For a total of 44 396 patients with FES, a within-individual Cox regression model was used to compare the risk of the treatment discontinuation and psychiatric hospitalization. Results In group comparison, a long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic group was associated with the lowest risk of the treatment discontinuation (0.64, 0.55–0.75) and psychiatric hospitalization (0.29, 0.22–0.38) in comparison with a typical antipsychotic group and no use, respectively. Among individual antipsychotics, the lowest risk of the treatment discontinuation was observed in LAI paliperidone (0.46, 0.37–0.66) compared to olanzapine. Clozapine was found to be the most effective antipsychotic in lowering the risk of psychiatric hospitalization as monotherapy compared to no use (0.23, 0.18–0.31). Conclusions In real-world patients with FES, LAI paliperidone and clozapine were associated with low treatment discontinuation and better effectiveness in lowering the risk of psychiatric hospitalization.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":8},"references":42,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
