But is it more than myth, and if so what is the nature of this relationship? We tested the hypotheses that musicians possess greater schizotypy and symptoms of bipolar disorder. A total of 102 musicians were found to have greater positive and negative schizotypal traits when compared to matched norms on the shortened Oxford–Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences. Based on the Mood Disorder Questionnaire, 10.8% of musicians also met criteria for lifetime bipolar disorder. Rock musicians appeared to have greater symptoms than those performing in other musical genres.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
