Clinical criminology studies offenders as individuals, examines their peculiarities and their social problems and seeks ways to help them to lead less troubled lives. A wide range of treatment interventions is required, the psychiatric approach is not always the most appropriate. In view of the lack of success in reducing recidivism by means of treatment, penologists see little justification for continuing to try. More successes might be recognized if treatment schemes were applied with greater realism and discrimination, and if proper evaluations were made more often. In any event, some offenders need treatment regardless of the effect upon their offending behaviour.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":12},"references":27,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
