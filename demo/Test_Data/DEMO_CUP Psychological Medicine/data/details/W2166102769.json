Both groups were interviewed in detail when aged 21–27 years and home observations were undertaken for those with young children. The institution-reared women showed a markedly increased rate of poor psychosocial functioning and of severe parenting difficulties in adult life. However, the support of a non-deviant spouse and of good living conditions in adult life provided a powerful protective effect.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":262},"references":33,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
