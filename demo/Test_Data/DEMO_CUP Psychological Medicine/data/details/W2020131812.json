It was suggested that children in a negative emotional state, uncertain about the condition of their airways, are inclined to interpret exercise-related general sensations (fatigue, heart pounding, sighing) in line with expectations as symptoms of airways obstruction. Consequently, they may report relatively high breathlessness, irrespective of actual objective symptoms of asthma.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":85},"references":20,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
