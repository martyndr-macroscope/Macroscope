The three papers in one way or another concern themselves with important issues in the assessment and diagnosis of social phobia (also known as social anxiety disorder; Liebowitz et al . 2000). I do so with the caveat that I am an author on one of the papers and do not claim the same degree of objectivity in examining my own work as I do in examining the work of others. The three papers concern the psychometric evaluation of a modified version of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) (Guy, 1976) in a sample of persons with social phobia (Zaider et al . 2003), the development of a self-report screening questionnaire for social phobia (Newman et al . 2003) and the characteristics of social phobia in the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHWB) (Lampe et al . 2003).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":6},"references":29,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
