To achieve conceptual clarity in the theory of placebogenic phenomena, this paper offers (1) a rigorous articulation of the placebo notion, (2) a lucid new terminology that obviates the defects intrinsic to the traditional locutions employed in the placebo literature, and (3) a substantial revamping of A. K. Shapiro's influential prior definition of‘placebo’. This paper supersedes an earlier version (Grünbaum, 1981).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":197},"references":42,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
