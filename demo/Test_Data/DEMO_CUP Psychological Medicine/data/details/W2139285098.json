Subjects were screened at three points – one, two, and three years after their participation in the war. The results indicated that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was correlated with a wider range of general psychiatric symptomatology, as measured by the SCL-90. Moreover, among PTSD veterans, those who suffered from an antecedent CSR reported wider and more severe symptomatology. This trend was observed at all three time points. The most salient symptoms were obsessive-compulsive tendencies and anxiety, followed by depression and hostility.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":33},"references":29,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
