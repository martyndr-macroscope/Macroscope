New health practitioners and physicians, who were not mental health specialists, blindly judged the presence or absence of depressive symptomatology. Twenty-one per cent of the patients suffered from depressive symptoms according to the CES-D, but only 15% of these were judged to be depressed by their physician or new health practitioner. The variables which predict the recognition of depressive symptomatology are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":28},"references":28,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
