The paper reports on the development of the WHOQOL-BREF, an abbreviated version of the WHOQOL-100 quality of life assessment. Method. The WHOQOL-BREF was derived from data collected using the WHOQOL-100. It produces scores for four domains related to quality of life: physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment. It also includes one facet on overall quality of life and general health. Results. Domain scores produced by the WHOQOL-BREF correlate highly (0·89 or above) with WHOQOL-100 domain scores (calculated on a four domain structure). WHOQOL-BREF domain scores demonstrated good discriminant validity, content validity, internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Conclusion. These data suggest that the WHOQOL-BREF provides a valid and reliable alternative to the assessment of domain profiles using the WHOQOL-100. It is envisaged that the WHOQOL-BREF will be most useful in studies that require a brief assessment of quality of life, for example, in large epidemiological studies and clinical trials where quality of life is of interest. In addition, the WHOQOL-BREF may be of use to health professionals in the assessment and evaluation of treatment efficacy.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":18,"cited_by_count":7302},"references":5,"networkCitations":18,"seed":false}
