Method We analyzed extensive clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data from n = 2081 Mexican Americans aged 35–64 years, recruited from the community as part of the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC) divided into three groups: Diagnosed (self-reported) diabetes (DD, n = 335), Undiagnosed diabetes (UD, n = 227) and No diabetes (ND, n = 1519). UD participants denied being diagnosed with diabetes, but on testing met the 2010 American Diabetes Association and World Health Organization definitions of diabetes. Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies – Depression (CES-D) scale. Weighted data were analyzed using dimensional and categorical outcomes using univariate and multivariate models. Results The DD group had significantly higher CES-D scores than both the ND and UD ( p ⩽ 0.001) groups, whereas the ND and UD groups did not significantly differ from each other. The DD subjects were more likely to meet the CES-D cut-off score for depression compared to both the ND and UD groups ( p = 0.001), respectively. The UD group was also less likely to meet the cut-off score for depression than the ND group ( p = 0.003). Our main findings remained significant in models that controlled for socio-demographic and clinical confounders. Conclusions Meeting clinical criteria for diabetes was not sufficient for increased depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that the ‘knowing that one is ill’ is associated with depressive symptoms in diabetic subjects.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":33},"references":79,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
