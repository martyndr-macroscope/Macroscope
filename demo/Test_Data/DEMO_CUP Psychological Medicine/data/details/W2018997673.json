The current study had two aims: (1) to determine whether, after 1 year, an internet-based CBT intervention was more effective than a waiting-list control group; and (2) to determine whether the effect of the internet-based CBT differed from the group CBT intervention, 1 year after the start of treatment. Method A total of 191 women and 110 men (mean age=55 years, s.d .=4.6) with subthreshold depression were randomized into internet-based treatment, group CBT (Lewinsohn's Coping with Depression Course), or a waiting-list control condition. The main outcome measure was treatment response after 1 year, defined as the difference in pretreatment and follow-up scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Missing data were imputed using the multiple imputation procedure of data augmentation. Analyses were performed using multiple imputation inference. Results In the waiting-list control group, we found a pretreatment to follow-up improvement effect size of 0.69, which was 0.62 in the group CBT condition and 1.22 with the internet-based treatment condition. Simple contrasts showed a significant difference between the waiting-list condition and internet-based treatment ( p =0.03) and no difference between both treatment conditions ( p =0.08). Conclusions People aged over 50 years with subthreshold depression can still benefit from internet-based CBT 1 year after the start of treatment.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":139},"references":17,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
