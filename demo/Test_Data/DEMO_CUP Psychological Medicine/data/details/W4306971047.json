Despite the foundational importance of construct validity and measurement to our field, insufficient attention is paid to these concerns in the assessment of psychopathology vulnerabilities prior to their implementation in causal models. I review the current state of construct validity and measurement in psychopathology research, highlighting the lack of consensus regarding how we should define and measure vulnerability constructs. The limited capacity of open science practices to address these definitional and measurement challenges is discussed. Recommendations for progress are made, including the need for consensus agreement on (1) working definitions and (2) measures of vulnerability constructs. Other recommendations include (3) the need to incentivize ‘pre-clinical’ descriptive work focused on measurement development, (4) the formation of open-access databases designed to facilitate measurement evaluation and development, and (5) increased exploration of the use of novel technologies to facilitate the collection of high-quality measures of vulnerability.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":43,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
