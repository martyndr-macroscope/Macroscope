Previous studies have primarily focused on undirected functional connectivity and rarely reported from network perspective. Methods To better understand between or within-network connectivities of OCD, effective connectivity (EC) of a large-scale network is assessed by spectral dynamic causal modeling with eight key regions of interests from default mode (DMN), salience (SN), frontoparietal (FPN) and cerebellum networks, based on large sample size including 100 OCD patients and 120 healthy controls (HCs). Parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) framework was used to identify the difference between the two groups. We further analyzed the relationship between connections and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Results OCD and HCs shared some similarities of inter- and intra-network patterns in the resting state. Relative to HCs, patients showed increased ECs from left anterior insula (LAI) to medial prefrontal cortex, right anterior insula (RAI) to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-DLPFC) to cerebellum anterior lobe (CA), CA to posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, weaker from LAI to L-DLPFC, RAI to ACC, and the self-connection of R-DLPFC. Connections from ACC to CA and from L-DLPFC to PCC were positively correlated with compulsion and obsession scores ( r = 0.209, p = 0.037; r = 0.199, p = 0.047, uncorrected). Conclusions Our study revealed dysregulation among DMN, SN, FPN, and cerebellum in OCD, emphasizing the role of these four networks in achieving top-down control for goal-directed behavior. There existed a top-down disruption among these networks, constituting the pathophysiological and clinical basis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":15},"references":56,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
