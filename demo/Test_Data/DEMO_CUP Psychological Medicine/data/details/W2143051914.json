A data set with known interrelationships of the continuous variables ‘stress’, ‘social support’, and ‘depression’ was simulated and analysed in tabular format. It is shown that the choice of cut-points for the independent variables crucially determines the size and presence of interaction effects in ratio analysis models.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":28},"references":15,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
