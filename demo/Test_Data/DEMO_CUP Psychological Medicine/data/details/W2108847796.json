The results indicated that the ‘average’ depressive patients seeking care in culturally different settings have many clinical features in common. A screening instrument, developed in the same study, has been shown to be effective in selecting depressive patients among in- and out-patient populations.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":76},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
