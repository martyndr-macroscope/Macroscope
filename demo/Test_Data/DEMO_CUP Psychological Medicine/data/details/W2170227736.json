Of the 92 patients who entered the trial significantly fewer on active treatment relapsed during the six-month trial period: 22% as compared with 50% of patients receiving placebo. Patients with residual symptoms on entry to the trial derived more benefit from continuation therapy than patients who had made a complete recovery. The findings relate to a six-month trial period only, and any possible advantage of continuation therapy over a longer period remains uncertain.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":226},"references":25,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
