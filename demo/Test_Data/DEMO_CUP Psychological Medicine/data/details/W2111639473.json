We consider these non-pharmaceutical, biologically based therapies to be potentially powerful adjuvants ready for clinical application. We also stress the need for additional studies, both in-patient and out-patient, to broaden the evidence base for indications and efficacy.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":272},"references":62,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
