Two-stage screening was carried out with a consecutive sample of 256 patients aged 15 69 consulting an experienced GP in a semi-rural setting over a six-week period. The GP made a standardized assessment of the reason for consultation and the degree of psychological disorder present. A 40% random sub-sample was then assessed using PROQSY. The area under the ROC curve using a GP criterion of minor psychological disorder (‘ degree of psychological problem - mild or greater ’) was 081 (s.D. = 006). However, the kappa coefficient obtained between this criterion assessment and the PROQSY assessment of minor psychological problem at the observed optimal cut-off score was only 0·28 (S.E. = 0–1; z = 2.83). It is concluded that PROQSY may be recommended for further development as a research tool providing a valid measure of minor psychological morbidity as assessed by GPs in primary care settings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":8},"references":21,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
