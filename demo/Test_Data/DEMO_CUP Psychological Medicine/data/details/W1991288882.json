It is suggested that depression is linked to patients' perception of controllability of their illness and absorption of cultural stereotypes of mental illness. Clinically and operationally diagnosed schizophrenic and manic-depressive patients receiving long-term maintenance treatment were studied. The cross-sectional prevalence of depression in schizophrenics was 29% and 11% for patients with bipolar affective illness. The hypothesis was supported. Multivariate analyses revealed that patients' perception of controllability of their illness powerfully discriminated depressed from non-depressed psychotic patients. Although those patients who accepted their diagnosis reported a lower perceived control over illness and an external locus of control, label acceptance was not associated with lowered depression, self-esteem or unemployment. The cross-sectional nature of the study makes the direction of causality and the role of intrinsic illness variables difficult to ascertain; however, the results set the scene for prospective and intervention studies and the various possibilities are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":354},"references":38,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
