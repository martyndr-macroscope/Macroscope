While precision medicine and digital mental health tools offer transformative potential, they also raise concerns about privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and the erosion of clinical judgment. This article introduces the Integrated Ethical Approach for Computational Psychiatry (IEACP) framework, developed through a conceptual synthesis of 83 studies. The framework comprises five procedural stages – Identification, Analysis, Decision-making, Implementation, and Review – each informed by six core ethical values – beneficence, autonomy, justice, privacy, transparency, and scientific integrity. By systematically addressing ethical dilemmas inherent in computational psychiatry, the IEACP provides clinicians, researchers, and policymakers with structured decision-making processes that support patient-centered, culturally sensitive, and equitable AI implementation. Through case studies, we demonstrate framework adaptability to real-world applications, underscoring the necessity of ethical innovation alongside technological progress in psychiatric care.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":77,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
