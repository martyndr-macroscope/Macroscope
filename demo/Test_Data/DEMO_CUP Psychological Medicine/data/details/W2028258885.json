However, some patients experience subsyndromal symptoms after they achieve remission. This study examines the prognostic significance of subsyndromal symptoms occurring during the first 6 months after remission of late-life depression. Method Older (age 60–89 years) in-patients and out-patients with unipolar major depression were followed until remission (asymptomatic or almost asymptomatic for 3 consecutive weeks). Two hundred and forty-two achieved remission after uncontrolled antidepressant treatment. This analysis focused on remitted patients who had follow-up data over a 2.5-year period ( n = 185). Results Approximately 18% of patients relapsed. Of the remainder ( n = 152), 42.8% had subsyndromal depressive symptoms during the 6 months following remission. Cox's proportional survival analysis demonstrated that longer duration of subsyndromal symptoms [number of weeks with the Longitudinal Follow-up Examination (LIFE) Psychiatric Status Rating Scale (PSR) score of 3 or 4] in the first 6 months after remission was significantly associated with shorter time to recurrence and higher recurrence rate [hazard ratio (HR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–1.24]. Based on our analysis, patients with 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of subsyndromal symptoms in the first 6 months after remission have estimated recurrence rates of 28, 45, 66 and 86% respectively during the ensuing 2 years. Conclusions These findings highlight the clinical importance of subsyndromal symptoms occurring after remission in late-life depression. They also argue that studies of geriatric depression may complement the definition of remission with information on subsyndromal symptoms occurring after the initial asymptomatic period.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":21},"references":52,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
