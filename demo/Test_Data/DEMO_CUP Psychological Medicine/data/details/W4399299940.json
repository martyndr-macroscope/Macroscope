This study aimed to examine associations between cognition and psychopathology dimensions in a large youth cohort. Method The sample ( N = 9350; age 8–21 years) was drawn from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Data from structured clinical interviews were modeled using bifactor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), resulting in an overall psychopathology (‘p’) factor score and six orthogonal psychopathology dimensions: dysphoria/distress, obsessive-compulsive, behavioral/externalizing, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, phobias, and psychosis. Neurocognitive data were aggregated using correlated-traits CFA into five factors: executive functioning, memory, complex cognition, social cognition, and sensorimotor speed. We examined relationships among specific and general psychopathology dimensions and neurocognitive factors. Results The final model showed both overall and specific associations between cognitive functioning and psychopathology, with acceptable fit (CFI = 0.91; TLI = 0.90; RMSEA = 0.024; SRMR = 0.054). Overall psychopathology and most psychopathology dimensions were negatively associated with neurocognitive functioning (phobias [ p &lt; 0.0005], behavioral/externalizing [ p &lt; 0.0005], attention-deficit/hyperactivity [ p &lt; 0.0005], psychosis [ p &lt; 0.0005 to p &lt; 0.05]), except for dysphoria/distress and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which were positively associated with complex cognition ( p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Conclusion By modeling a broad range of cognitive and psychopathology domains in a large, diverse sample of youth, we found aspects of neurocognitive functioning shared across clinical phenotypes, as well as domain-specific patterns. Findings support transdiagnostic examination of cognitive performance to parse variability in the link between neurocognitive functioning and clinical phenotypes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":4},"references":98,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
