Preliminary findings from the United Kingdom study with 22 child psychiatrists are reported. The study included two parts: (1) a reliability study using the case histories of 17 patients; and (2) the testing of the classification in routine clinical practice. The ways in which these methods may be used to evaluate a new system of classification are described. It is concluded that a multi-axial system has such important advantages that it should be tried out further both in the field of child psychiatry and in other branches of psychiatry.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":45},"references":6,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
