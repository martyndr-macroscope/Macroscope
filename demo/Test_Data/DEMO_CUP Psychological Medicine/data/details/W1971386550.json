No difference in mortality or changes in dementia scores were found, but the survivors' levels of dependency improved most in day centres and local authority homes. This finding, and the problems of matching, are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":54},"references":21,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
