However, little is known about how DBS exerts its antidepressive effects. Here, we investigated whether ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule stimulation modulates a limbic network centered around the amygdala in patients with treatment-resistant MDD. Methods Nine patients underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance scans before DBS surgery and after 1 year of treatment. In addition, they were scanned twice within 2 weeks during the subsequent double-blind cross-over phase with active and sham treatment. Twelve matched controls underwent scans at the same time intervals to account for test–retest effects. The imaging data were investigated with functional connectivity (FC) analysis and dynamic causal modelling. Results Results showed that 1 year of DBS treatment was associated with increased FC of the left amygdala with precentral cortex and left insula, along with decreased bilateral connectivity between nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. No changes in FC were observed during the cross-over phase. Effective connectivity analyses using dynamic causal models revealed widespread amygdala-centric changes between presurgery and 1 year follow-up, while the cross-over phase was associated with insula-centric changes between active and sham stimulation. Conclusions These results suggest that ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule DBS results in complex rebalancing of the limbic network involved in emotion, reward, and interoceptive processing.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":53,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
