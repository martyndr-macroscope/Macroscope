The model describes the statistical behaviour of an ideal array of elements, representing the brain, during tests of cognitive ability. Predictions from the model indicate that comparison of the EEC recording taken from groups of children who were good or poor readers would show amplitude differences. These were found between the groups when the eyes were open but not when the eyes were closed–a result explained by the model.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":32},"references":8,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
