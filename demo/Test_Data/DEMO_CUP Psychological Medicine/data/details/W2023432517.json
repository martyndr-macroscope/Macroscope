We conclude from our findings, as well as from other clinical reports, that growth-hormone deficiency of early onset does probably not interfere with normal human brain development.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":23,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
