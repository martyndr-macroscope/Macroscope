Similarly, the deleterious impact of early traumatic experiences on depression seems to be moderated by individual genetic variability. Serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulate the effect of childhood adversity on adult depression, although inconsistencies across studies have been found. Moreover, the gene×environment (G×E) interaction concerning the different types of childhood adversity remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to analyse the putative interaction between the 5-HTT gene (5-HTTLPR polymorphism), the BDNF gene (Val66Met polymorphism) and childhood adversity in accounting for adult depressive symptoms. Method A sample of 534 healthy individuals filled in self-report questionnaires of depressive symptomatology [the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90-R)] and different types of childhood adversities [the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)]. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism (5-HTT gene) and the Val66Met polymorphism (BDNF gene) were genotyped in the whole sample. Results Total childhood adversity (β=0.27, p &lt;0.001), childhood sexual abuse (CSA; β=0.17, p &lt;0.001), childhood emotional abuse (β=0.27, p &lt;0.001) and childhood emotional neglect (β=0.22, p &lt;0.001) had an impact on adult depressive symptoms. CSA had a greater impact on depressive symptoms in Met allele carriers of the BDNF gene than in the Val/Val group ( F =5.87, p &lt;0.0001), and in S carriers of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism (5-HTT gene) ( F =5.80, p &lt;0.0001). Conclusions Childhood adversity per se predicted higher levels of adult depressive symptoms. In addition, BDNF Val66Met and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms seemed to moderate the effect of CSA on adult depressive symptoms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":264},"references":58,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
