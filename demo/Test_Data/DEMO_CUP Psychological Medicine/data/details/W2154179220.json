The literature pertaining to the link between normal beliefs and behaviour is briefly examined, emphasizing the predominance of psychological and philosophical contributions to the topic. The psychiatric literature describing actions consequent upon delusional beliefs is then reviewed. In conclusion, those aspects of psychosis, distinct from delusional beliefs themselves, which may affect the likelihood of a given belief being acted upon, are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":28},"references":136,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
