Although genes are known to influence the aetiology of ADHD, the impact of exposure to parental ADHD has received limited scientific scrutiny. This study investigated the impact of exposure to parental ADHD on clinical features and dysfunction in offspring. Methods. We studied 1099 offspring (53% male, mean age 12·4 years) of non-ADHD, remitted ADHD, and persistent ADHD parents, using structured diagnostic interviews and a battery of cognitive and psychosocial measures. Offspring across these three groups were compared on clinical, cognitive and psychosocial outcomes, adjusting for exposure to other parental psychopathology, offspring ADHD status and social class. Results. Parental ADHD was associated with an increased risk for ADHD in offspring relative to no parental ADHD, but no significant differences were found between children of remitted versus persistent ADHD parents. Exposure to parental ADHD predicted higher levels of family conflict and lesser levels of family cohesion relative to families without parental ADHD, independent of other psychopathological conditions in parents or ADHD status. Significant interactions were detected in which parental ADHD had a deleterious impact on measures of school performance in offspring without ADHD but not in those with the disorder. Conclusions. These results find no support for the hypothesis that exposure to parental ADHD increases the risk for ADHD in children beyond that conveyed by the liability associated with the diagnosis in the parent. However, since exposure to parental ADHD was associated with a disruptive family environment, the identification and treatment of adults with ADHD may be an important component of the treatment plan of youth with ADHD.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":93},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
