No significant differences in basal GH were found between the control and either the non-delusional or the delusional groups. The whole group of depressed patients showed a significantly lower response than the control patients at all points of the GH response to GHRH curve as well as a lower area under curve. When the three groups (control, delusional and non-delusional depressed) were compared, it was found that only the non-delusional depressed patients had a significantly lower area under curve and lower values at +60, +90 and +120 min than the controls. The only significant difference between the two groups of depressed patients was that the delusional group showed a delayed appearance of the maximum response peak and a more prolonged response.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":10},"references":16,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
