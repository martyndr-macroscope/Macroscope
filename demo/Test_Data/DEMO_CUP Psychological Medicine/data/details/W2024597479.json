We have investigated these disorders by systematically recording and collecting data about the behaviour of 100 severely and profoundly retarded hospitalized adults and subjecting the data thus derived to cluster analysis. Eight clusters were isolated. The clinical psychiatric significance of these clusters is discussed and their relationship to cause of retardation, duration of stay in hospital and visiting is considered. A diagnostic framework for psychiatric disorder in severely and profoundly retarded adults is put forward and some possible treatment approaches are suggested.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":68},"references":43,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
