The trial lasted 7 months and those patients in whom overactivity was the dominant problem responded to some degree to carbamazepine with a reduction in overactivity. This was particularly so in patients in whom overactivity was accompanied by some elevation of mood. Patients in whom overactivity was part of a wider spectrum of multiple behaviour disorders showed a scatter of responses. There was no relationship between response to carbamazepine and the presence or absence of epilepsy. The trial identified a small group of mentally retarded patients in whom carbamazepine might be clinically useful.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":66},"references":6,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
