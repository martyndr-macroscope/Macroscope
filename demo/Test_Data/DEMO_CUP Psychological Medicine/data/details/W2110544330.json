There were no differences in binding characteristics between patients and controls for either [H]yohimbine or [H]imipramine. There were no differences in binding between patients classified as endogenous using the Newcastle Scale, compared with non-endogenous patients, and no difference between DST suppressors and non-suppressors. The severity of depression did not affect binding values. After 4–6 weeks antidepressant treatment [H]yohimbine binding was significantly reduced but [H]imipramine binding was unaffected.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":40},"references":50,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
