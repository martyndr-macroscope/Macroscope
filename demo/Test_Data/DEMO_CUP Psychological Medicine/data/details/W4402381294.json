Thus, research has grown regarding CBT-specific self-help for psychosis, warranting an overall review of the literature. A systematic literature review was conducted, following a published protocol which can be found at: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/export_record_pdf.php . A search was conducted across Scopus, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science to identify relevant literature, exploring CBT-based self-help interventions for individuals experiencing psychosis. The PICO search strategy tool was used to generate search terms. A narrative synthesis was conducted of all papers, and papers were appraised for quality. Ten studies were included in the review. Seven papers found credible evidence to support the effectiveness of CBT-based self-help in reducing features of psychosis. Across the studies, common secondary outcomes included depression, overall psychological well-being, and daily functioning, all of which were also found to significantly improve following self-help intervention, as well as evidence to support its secondary benefit for depression, anxiety, overall well-being, and functioning. Due to methodological shortcomings, long-term outcomes are unclear.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":25,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
