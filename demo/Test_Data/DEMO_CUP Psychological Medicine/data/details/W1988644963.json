Thus, vasopressin, ACTH and like peptides may influence memory processes, and ACTH and MSH given intracranially induce a peculiar stretching and yawning syndrome accompanied by penile erection and ejaculation. Thyrotrophic hormone-releasing factor potentiates behavioural excitation, somatostatin is depressive, while luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone facilitates sexual behaviour and the newly identified endorphins are markedly opioid in character. These and other activities of the hypothalamic peptides are reviewed and assessed alongside the clinical information available.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":22},"references":72,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
