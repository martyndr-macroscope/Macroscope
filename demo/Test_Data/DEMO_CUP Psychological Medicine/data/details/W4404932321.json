We investigate whether age at onset (AAO) reflects genetic heterogeneity, utilizing Genetic Risk Ratios (GRR) derived from Family Genetic Risk Scores (FGRS). Methods We examined, in individuals born in Sweden 1940–2003, whether AAO for five primary disorders -- drug use disorder (DUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ)-- was associated with varying levels of GRRs with a range of informative secondary disorders and traits. Results Our disorders displayed a varying pattern of change of GRRs with increasing AAO. At one end was SZ, where all GRRs rose with increasing AAO meaning that SZ became increasing genetically heterogeneous with later AAO. The most balanced disorder was AUD where, with increasing AAO, GRRs rose for AD, BD, and MD and declined for DUD, CB, and ADHD. That is, at young AAO, AUD had high levels of genetic risk for other externalizing disorders while at older AAO, high genetic risk for internalizing disorders were more prominent. MD was at the continuum's other end where all GRRs, except for AD, decreased with higher AAO, meaning that MD became increasingly genetically homogeneous with later AAO. Conclusions Genetic heterogeneity was robustly associated with AAO across our five primary disorders with substantial inter-disorder differences in the observed patterns. In particular, young AAO was associated with maximal genetic homogeneity for SZ and DUD while older AAO had greater genetic homogeneity for MD with AUD falling in between.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":0},"references":47,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
