(1992). For this analysis, mothers' and fathers' scores were analysed separately. It was shown by t tests that mothers' and fathers' scores on the coping strategy subscales had not significantly changed over the three-year period. Time 1 and Time 2 scores on all of the coping subscales were strongly positively associated, with the exception of fathers' scores on the Stoicism subscale. Test–retest reliability was adequate for all subscales except mothers' scores on the Passive Acceptance subscale and fathers' scores on the Stoicism subscale. These results, by demonstrating the stability of the Ways of Coping (Revised) Questionnaire over a 3-year time period, further illustrate the utility of this instrument for investigating coping in families with special problems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":14},"references":12,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
