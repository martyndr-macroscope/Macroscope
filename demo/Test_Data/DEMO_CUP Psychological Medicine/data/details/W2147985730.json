They obtained higher scores than normals even when well and their scores increased considerably during episodes of depression in proportion to the depth of the depression. In mania, on the other hand, obsessional symptoms are rare.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":118},"references":11,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
