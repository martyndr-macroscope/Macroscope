Age, neuroticism and extraversion, but not sex, have proved to be associated with the variability which different subjects show in this regard. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to various theoretical constructs which seek to explain the interaction between personality variables and cognitive performance.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":28},"references":32,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
