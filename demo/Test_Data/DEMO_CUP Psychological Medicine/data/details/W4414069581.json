We studied short and longer-term effects of discontinuation of D 2 receptor (D 2 R) antagonist and partial agonist antipsychotics on striatal dopamine D 2/3 R availability in FEP patients. Methods Remitted FEP patients underwent two [ 11 C]raclopride PET scans to measure striatal D 2/3 R availability: 1 week after antipsychotic discontinuation (n = 16 antagonist users, n = 6 partial agonist users) and after being medication free for 6–8 weeks (n = 8 antagonist users, n = 5 partial agonist users). Fifteen matched healthy controls were scanned once. Psychotic relapse was monitored up to 12 months after discontinuation. Results One week after discontinuation, D 2 R antagonist discontinuers showed higher striatal binding potential (BP ND ) than partial D 2 R agonist discontinuers ( p &lt; 0.001, CI = 0.749 to 1.681) and controls ( p = 0.045, CI = 0.008 to 0.708), while partial agonist discontinuers had significantly lower BP ND than controls ( p = 0.001, CI = -1.326 to -0.386). 6-8 weeks after discontinuation, former antagonist users showed similar BP ND to controls ( p &gt; 0.25), whereas former partial agonist users had higher BP ND than controls ( p = 0.027, CI = 0.069 to 1.085). Participants who discontinued antagonists relapsed more often (81%) than those who discontinued partial agonists (17%)(χ 2 = 5.32, p = 0.021). Conclusions Discontinuation of partial D 2 R agonists may affect D 2/3 R availability differently than discontinuation of antagonists, which might explain the greater relapse risk after tapering antagonists than partial agonist antipsychotics.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":47,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
