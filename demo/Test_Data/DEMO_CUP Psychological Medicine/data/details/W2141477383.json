In the main study 11 obsessional neurotic and 11 depressive patients matched for severity of illness were given questionnaires to measure experienced hostility and anger, and a repertory grid of standard form. The obsessional group showed a qualitatively distinct correlational pattern of measured aspects of hostility–anger, including a high correlation between outwardly directed aspects of hostility and anger; this pattern was replicated in a validation study. In contrast, the obsessional group was not differentiated by a negative cognitive set. Treatment implications for obsessional neurosis are briefly discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":20},"references":24,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
