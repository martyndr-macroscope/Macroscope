Results show that depressed patients are impaired on the cued recall task in comparison with controls matched for sex, age, and educational level. However, the two groups do not differ in the word-stem completion task. This dissociation between explicit and implicit expressions of memory disappeared when patients recovered, although they were still hospitalized and under psychotropic medication. These results are examined in the light of the distinction between effortful and automatic processes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":97},"references":63,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
