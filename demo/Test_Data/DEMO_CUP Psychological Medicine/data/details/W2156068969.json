Within schizophrenia the presence of disorganized thoughts at the index admission was associated with poor outcome, whereas better outcome was associated with the presence of delusions or hallucinations. Within the affective disorders, bipolar patients with grandiose delusions or ideas showed a poor outcome; a better outcome was found in unipolar patients with complaints of fatiguability or tiredness at the time of the index admission.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":9},"references":7,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
