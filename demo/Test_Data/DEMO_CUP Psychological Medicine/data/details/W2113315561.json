The reliability between raters differing in training and language was 0·86 (Swedish and English raters) and 0·92 (Swedish and Danish raters); the reliability between two Swedish raters was 0·97. There was a strong correlation between severity of depression as measured on this scale and on a nurses' rating scale (0·87). The correlation with patients' self-ratings of depression was weaker (0·63) but still significant.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":49},"references":15,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
