For most of the trial patients received either 9 mg methysergide or 450 mg thioridazine daily; during one 24-hour period 12 mg methysergide or 600 mg thioridazine was administered. Daily clinical assessments were made. Methysergide proved significantly less effective than the phenothiazine.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":14,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
