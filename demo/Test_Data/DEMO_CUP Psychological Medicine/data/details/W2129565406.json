The mean age of the sample was 33·1 (±5·3) years. Severity of symptoms decreased with age and was not associated with the duration of symptoms. Depression-related factors were associated with the severity of PMS, and together with the duration of symptoms, were the best discriminators between the younger (ages 20–35) and older (ages 36–44) women in this sample. These data suggest that the years of the late twenties through mid-thirties are the most vulnerable time for distressing PMS and fail to support the clinical premise that PMS worsens with age until menopause. Further longitudinal study should be conducted to confirm and extend these findings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":75},"references":35,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
