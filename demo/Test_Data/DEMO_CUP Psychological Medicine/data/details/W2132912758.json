Six ways of categorizing life events and difficulties were analysed: namely, loss (L) , threat (T) , anti-social act (A) , hopeless situation (H) , uncertainty of outcome (U) , and choice of action (C) . Reliabilities were moderate to good. The number and the pattern of characteristics within a single event or difficulty were found to be the most important elements in predicting a depression score criterion. Two patterns were particularly predictive: CH present in an event or difficulty, and LH present with U absent. Approximately 21·9% of the depression score variance maybe explained using life events together with the respondent's social class, sex and social support. This represents a significant improvement over prediction based solely on the scoring methods of Brown &amp; Harris (1978).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":35},"references":12,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
