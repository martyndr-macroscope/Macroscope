High mortality rates have been reported in some risk groups, including patients with pre-existing mental disorders. Methods We used electronic health records to retrospectively identify people infected due to COVID-19 (between March 2020 and March 2021) in the three territories of the Basque Country. COVID-19 cases were defined as individuals who had tested positive on a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models and multilevel analyses with generalized estimated equations were used to determine factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality and hospital admission. Results The COVID-19 mortality rate was increased for patients with psychotic disorders [odds ratio (OR) adjusted: 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.09–1.94), p = 0.0114] and patients with substance abuse [OR adjusted: 1.88, 95% CI (1.13–3.14, p &lt; 0.0152)]. The mortality rate was lower for patients with affective disorders [OR adjusted: 0.80, 95% CI (0.61–0.99), p = 0.0407]. Hospital admission rates due to COVID-19 were higher in psychosis [OR adjusted: 2.90, 95% CI (2.36–3.56), p &lt; 0.0001] and anxiety disorder groups [OR adjusted: 1.54, 95% CI (1.37–1.72), p &lt; 0.0001]. Among admitted patients, COVID-19 mortality rate was decreased for those with affective disorders rate [OR adjusted: 0.72, 95% CI (0.55–0.95), p = 0.0194]. Conclusions COVID-19-related mortality and hospitalizations rates were higher for patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":18},"references":55,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
