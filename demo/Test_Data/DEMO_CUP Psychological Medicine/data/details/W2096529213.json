The questionnaire aims to assess cognitive decline independent of pre-morbid ability. In the present study, the IQCODE was administered to a sample of 613 informants from the general population. In addition, the questionnaire was administered to informants of 309 dementing subjects who had filled it out one year previously. A principal components analysis, using the general population sample, confirmed that the IQCODE measures a general factor of cognitive decline. The questionnaire was found to have high internal reliability in the general population sample (alpha = 0·95) and reasonably high test-retest reliability over one year in the dementing sample ( r = 0·75). The total IQCODE score, as well as each of the 26-items, was found to discriminate well between the general population and dementing samples. The correlation with education was quite small ( r = – 0·13), indicating that contamination by premorbid ability is not a problem.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":12,"cited_by_count":1092},"references":13,"networkCitations":12,"seed":false}
