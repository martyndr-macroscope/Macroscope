Identifying the network of genes regulated by MIR137 could provide insights into the biological processes underlying schizophrenia. In addition, DLPFC functional connectivity, a robust correlate of MIR137, may provide plausible endophenotypes. However, the regulatory role of the MIR137 gene network in the disrupted functional connectivity remains unclear. Here, we tested the effects of the MIR137 regulated genes on the risk for schizophrenia and DLPFC functional connectivity. Methods To evaluate the additive effects of the MIR137 regulated genes ( N = 1274), we calculated a MIR137 polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia and tested its association with the risk for schizophrenia in the genomic data of a Han Chinese population that included schizophrenia patients ( N = 589) and normal controls ( N = 575). We then investigated the association between MIR137 PRS and DLPFC functional connectivity in two independent young healthy cohorts ( N = 356 and N = 314). Results We found that the MIR137 PRS successfully captured the differences in genetic structure between the patients and controls, but the single gene MIR137 did not. We then consistently found that a higher MIR137 PRS was correlated with lower functional connectivities between the DLPFC and both the superior parietal cortex and the inferior temporal cortex in two independent cohorts. Conclusion The findings suggested that these two functional connectivities of the DLPFC could be important endophenotypes linking the MIR137 -regulated genetic structure to schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":20},"references":58,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
