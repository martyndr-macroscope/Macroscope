Healthcare workers play an essential role and are one of the most exposed groups. Information about the psychosocial impact on healthcare workers is limited. Methods 3109 healthcare workers completed a national, internet-based, cross-sectional 45-item survey between 9 and 19 April 2020. The objective is to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spanish healthcare workers. A Psychological Stress and Adaptation at work Score (PSAS) was defined combining four modified versions of validated psychological assessment tests (A) Healthcare Stressful Test , (B) Coping Strategies Inventory , (C) Font-Roja Questionnaire and (D) Trait Meta-Mood Scale . Results The highest psychosocial impact was perceived in Respiratory Medicine, the mean (S.D.) PSAS was 48.3 (13.6) and Geriatrics 47.6 (16.4). Higher distress levels were found in the geographical areas with the highest incidence of COVID-19 (&gt;245.5 cases per 100 000 people), PSAS 46.8 (15.2); p &lt; 0.001. The least stress respondents were asymptomatic workers PSAS, 41.3 (15.4); p &lt; 0.001, as well as those above 60 years old, PSAS, 37.6 (16); p &lt; 0.001. Workers who needed psychological therapy and did not receive it, were more stressed PSAS 52.5 (13.6) than those who did not need it PSAS 39.7 (13.9); p &lt; 0.001. Conclusions The psychological impact in healthcare workers in Spain during COVID-19 emergency has been studied. The stress perceived is parallel to the number of cases per 100 000 people. Psychotherapy could have a major role to mitigate the experimented stress level.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":135},"references":21,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
