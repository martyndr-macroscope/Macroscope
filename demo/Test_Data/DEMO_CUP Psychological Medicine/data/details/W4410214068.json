Understanding the shared genetic underpinnings of these spectra is crucial for advancing knowledge of their biological bases and informing empirical models like the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) and Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP). Methods We applied genomic structural equation modeling to summary statistics from 16 EXT and INT traits in individuals genetically similar to European reference panels (EUR-like; n = 16,400 to 1,074,629). Traits included clinical (e.g. major depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder) and subclinical measures (e.g. risk tolerance, irritability). We tested five confirmatory factor models to identify the best fitting and most parsimonious genetic architecture and then conducted multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the resulting latent factors. Results A two-factor correlated model, representing EXT and INT spectra, provided the best fit to the data. There was a moderate genetic correlation between EXT and INT (r = 0.37, SE = 0.02), with bivariate causal mixture models showing extensive overlap in causal variants across the two spectra (94.64%, SE = 3.27). Multivariate GWAS identified 409 lead genetic variants for EXT, 85 for INT, and 256 for the shared traits. Conclusions The shared genetic liabilities for EXT and INT identified here help to characterize the genetic architecture underlying these frequently comorbid forms of psychopathology. The findings provide a framework for future research aimed at understanding the shared and distinct biological mechanisms underlying psychopathology, which will help to refine psychiatric classification systems and potentially inform treatment approaches.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":56,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
