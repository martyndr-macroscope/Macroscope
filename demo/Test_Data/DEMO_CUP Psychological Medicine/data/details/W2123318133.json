Consequently, various studies have examined the effects of motivational enhancement therapy (MET) on motivation to change and treatment outcome in eating disorders. In each of these studies, MET was administered in a face-to-face setting. However, because of its anonymity and ease of access, the internet provides several advantages as the format for such an intervention. Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of an internet-based program (‘ESS-KIMO’) to enhance motivation to change in eating disorders. Method In total, 212 females were accepted for participation and assigned randomly to the intervention condition ( n = 103) or waiting-list control condition ( n = 109). The intervention consisted of six online MET sessions. Before and after the intervention or waiting period respectively, participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), the Stages of Change Questionnaire for Eating Disorders (SOCQ-ED), the Pros and Cons of Eating Disorders Scale (P-CED), the Self-Efficacy Scale (SES), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). A total of 125 participants completed the assessment post-treatment. Completer analyses and intent-to-treat analyses were performed. Results Significant time × group interactions were found, indicating a stronger increase in motivational aspects and self-esteem, in addition to a stronger symptom reduction on some measures from pre- to post-treatment in the intervention group compared to the control group. Conclusions Internet-based approaches can be considered as useful for enhancing motivation to change in eating disorders and for yielding initial symptomatic improvement.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":53},"references":87,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
