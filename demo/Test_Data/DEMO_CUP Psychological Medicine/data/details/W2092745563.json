These findings are particularly discussed in relation to the notion that, since the pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease are particularly manifest in the hippocampal region, then this involvement of the hippocampus might explain the memory disorder. The present experiment, which is similar to one previously reported using subjects with bilateral hippocampal lesions, shows the two types of memory disorder resulting from bilateral hippocampal damage and Alzheimer's disease to be qualitatively different. Some outstanding problems with regard to obtaining a complete understanding of the nature of the amnesic phenomena in Alzheimer's disease are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":81},"references":11,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
