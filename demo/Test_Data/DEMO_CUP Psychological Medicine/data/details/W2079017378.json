The ratio of the mean patient to normal scores ranged from 2·4: 1 for obsessional traits and 3·2: 1 for symptoms to 6·2: 1 for resistance and 12·5: 1 for interference with other activities. A principal components analysis on the patients' replies produced 3 unitary components (household order, personal contamination, and doubting) plus 2 bipolar components (checking/parsimony and desire for closure/unpleasant ruminations). These appeared to be more definitive representations of components identified from a similar analysis on normal subjects, suggesting that obsessional neurotics differ from normal subjects quantitatively rather than qualitatively. A cluster analysis on the patients' responses produced 3 subgroups. Thirty-two patients were predominantly hesitant and indecisive (‘doubters’), 30 were concerned with bodily and clothing contamination (‘contaminators’), and 7 were preoccupied with checking (‘checkers’).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":35},"references":28,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
