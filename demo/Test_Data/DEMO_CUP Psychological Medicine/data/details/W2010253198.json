There was substantial agreement across most Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) categories, but there was less agreement on the rating of symptoms. The implications of these similarities and differences between the techniques are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":40},"references":23,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
