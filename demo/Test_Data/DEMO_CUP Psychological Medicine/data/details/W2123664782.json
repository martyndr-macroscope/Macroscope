Memory loss showed a temporal gradient, but new learning was spared. Both brain perfusion imaging with 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT, and EEG localized the lesion in the left temporal lobe while CT and MRI were normal. This observation supports the anatomical differentiation between the different memory functions. The uncommon combination of isolated retrograde amnesia without other neuropsychological findings may raise the doubt of psychogenic aetiology, which in this case was refuted.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":32},"references":29,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
