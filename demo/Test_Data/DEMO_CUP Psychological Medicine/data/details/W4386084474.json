As there has been no report from Turkey, this study aimed to provide the treated incidence rate of first-episode psychosis (FEP) in a defined area. Methods All individuals, aged 15–64 years, presenting with FEP (ICD-10 F20-29, F30-33) to mental health services in a defined catchment-area in Sinop which is located in the Black Sea region of the northern Turkey were recorded over a 4-year period (2009 to 2012). Incidence rates of psychotic disorders and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Poisson regression was applied to estimate the differences in incidence rate ratio (IRR) by age, sex, and urbanicity. Results One hundred and fifteen FEP participants were identified during the 4 years. Crude incidence rates of all psychoses, schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and affective psychotic disorders were respectively 38.5 (95% CI 27.1–49.9), 10.7 (95% CI 6.6–14.8), 10.0 (95% CI 5.7–14.3) and 17.7 (95% CI 11.3–24.2) per 100 000 person-years. After age-sex standardisation the rates increased slightly. There were no gender differences in the incidence rates. IRR of any psychotic disorder was highest in the youngest age group (15–24 years) compared to the oldest age group (55–64 years), 7.9 (95% CI 2.8–30.5). In contrast with previous studies, the incidence rate of any psychotic disorder was not significantly increased in urban areas compared with rural areas. Conclusions The current study, the first of its kind from Turkey, indicates that the risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in a lowly urbanised area of Turkey is comparable to those reported in Western European cities.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":2},"references":48,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
