We measured neopterin and creatinine concentrations in the plasma and urine of 22 schizophrenic and 26 depressed patients admitted acutely to hospital, and compared results with those in a large group of normal controls. Neopterin/creatinine ratios were normal in the schizophrenic patients, but significantly elevated in the plasma of depressed patients. In each diagnostic group, the use of psychotropic drugs before admission had no effect on the neopterin ratios observed. Our findings indicate altered cell-mediated immunity in depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":88},"references":34,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
