This preliminary report of a collaborative study demonstrates the similarity of the 2 samples. Institutions in the 2 cities are shown to differ in size, type of ownership and the frequency that skilled nursing is provided. Some implications of these 2 findings are raised now, and will be discussed later when the full data for the study are presented.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":53},"references":6,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
