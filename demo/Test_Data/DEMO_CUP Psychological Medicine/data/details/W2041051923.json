The results confirm the previously described tendency by patients with anorexia nervosa to overestimate body size in the stage before their treatment in hospital. Various differences between the two groups were found and the anorexic patients were more inconsistent in the estimation of the different body measures. On the basis of correlations with the results of an internal-external control questionnaire, it is suggested that overestimation and variability in visual size estimation could be promoted by an orientation towards external control.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":85},"references":16,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
