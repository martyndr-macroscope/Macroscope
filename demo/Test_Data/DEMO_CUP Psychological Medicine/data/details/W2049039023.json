The overall ratio of met to unmet need was almost exactly 5:1. Need was shown to vary according to chronicity, degree of participation, and placement in day-hospital or day-centre. Specific areas of functioning and specific types of care were identified in which there was significant overprovision or underprovision. The utility of our measures, and their ability to identify clinically significant unmet need, are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":108},"references":5,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
