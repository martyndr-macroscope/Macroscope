We aim to examine the phenotypic expression of ADHD symptoms in these age groups. Methods This study comprised a random sample ( N = 1,562) from the US Health and Retirement Study 2016, a representative US sample aged 50 years and over. ADHD symptoms were assessed based on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale. Results In the primary analysis, 10 competing confirmatory factor analytic models of ADHD symptoms in middle- and older-aged adults were compared. The best-fitting model was hierarchical with a general ADHD factor at the apex and underneath symptom factors of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity ( ꭓ 2 = 319.34, df = 91.71, P = 0.00, TLI = 0.98, CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.04–0.05). In complementary analyses, this model was a satisfactory fit to the data: (1) in individuals without a history of cognitive impairment or dementia, and when the general ADHD factor was specified to load on (2) cognitive function, (3) depressive symptoms (which showed adequate fit), and (4) ADHD polygenic scores, (5) in middle- and older-aged adults, and (6) when weighted to represent the US population. Conclusions These results imply a hierarchical representation of ADHD symptoms in middle- and older-aged adults consisting of a general factor at the apex with neurocognitive and genetic correlates and underneath symptom factors of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Collectively, this model offers a novel framework to study the mechanisms of ADHD symptoms in middle- and older-aged adults and points to treatment targets.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":34,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
