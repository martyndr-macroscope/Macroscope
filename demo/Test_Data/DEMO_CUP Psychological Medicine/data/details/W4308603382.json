However, the strength of the empirical evidence for this association remains a topic of debate. This study aimed to estimate the association between health anxiety and interpretation bias and to identify potential moderators of this association. Chinese-language databases (CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang), English-language databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus), and German-language databases (Psyndex and PubPsych) were searched for relevant studies. There were 36 articles (39 studies) identified by this search ( N = 8984), of which 32 articles (34 studies) were included in the meta-analysis ( N = 8602). Results revealed a medium overall effect size ( g = 0.67). Statistically equivalent effect sizes were observed for patients diagnosed with clinical health anxiety ( g = 0.58) and subclinical health anxiety ( g = 0.72). The effect sizes for threat stimuli that were health related ( g = 0.68) and not health related ( g = 0.63) did not differ significantly. The effect size for studies using an offline paradigm ( g = 0.75) was significantly higher than that for studies using an online paradigm ( g = 0.50). It is concluded that health anxiety is significantly and robustly associated with interpretation bias. These findings are of central importance for the advancement of models and treatment of health anxiety.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":20},"references":82,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
