Contrary to prediction, the prevalence of behaviour and emotional problems 2 months after the fire was less than the prevalence in a carefully selected comparison group. Rather than decrease with time, the prevalence of psychological morbidity increased significantly, being as great 26 months after the disaster as at 8 months.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":218},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
