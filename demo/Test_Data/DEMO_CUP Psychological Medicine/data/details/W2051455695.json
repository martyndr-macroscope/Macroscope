Patients who completed out-patient treatment had a better outcome than those who failed to attend treatment sessions. Completion of out-patient treatment was more frequent among higher social class patients. Domiciliary treatment may be more appropriate in some cases for married patients and for those of lower social class. Medical and non-medical staff proved to be equally effective therapists. Future research should be concerned with evaluation of alternative methods of provision of help and further identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":93},"references":28,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
