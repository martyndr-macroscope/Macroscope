Methods In early mid-life, 187 Black and 198 White ( M age = 39.4, s.d. age = 1.2) women reported on early abuse and age at first menstruation (menarche). Women provided saliva and blood to assess epigenetic aging, telomere length, and C-reactive protein. Using structural equation modeling, we created a latent variable of biological aging using epigenetic aging, telomere length, and C-reactive protein as indicators, and a latent variable of early abuse using indicators of abuse/threat events before age 13, physical abuse, and sexual abuse. We estimated the indirect effects of early abuse and of race on accelerated aging through age at menarche. Race was used as a proxy for adversity in the form of systemic racism. Results There was an indirect effect of early adversity on accelerated aging through age at menarche ( b = 0.19, 95% CI 0.03–0.44), in that women who experienced more adversity were younger at menarche, which was associated with greater accelerated aging. There was also an indirect effect of race on accelerated aging through age at menarche ( b = 0.25, 95% CI 0.04–0.52), in that Black women were younger at menarche, which led to greater accelerated aging. Conclusions Early abuse and being Black in the USA may both induce a phenotype of accelerated aging. Early adversity may begin to accelerate aging during childhood, in the form of early pubertal timing.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":21},"references":85,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
