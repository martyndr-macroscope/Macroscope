Psychological Medicine has long had a tradition of issues which are substantial in thickness, and produce large annual volumes. With progressive expansion of the total number of pages published annually over the last ten years, we have moved from the previous quarterly issues to every two months and then to eight issues per year. Increasing to monthly issues will thin each issue a little but it coincides with a further increase in the total annual number of pages and of papers published. We will now be able to serve our authors better by publishing their papers more quickly. Since last year, all papers have also been published online rapidly, as soon as they have been typeset and proofread, well in advance of being assigned to a printed issue, further enhancing rapid dissemination to readers. We are also making some changes in the regional distribution of editorial responsibilities. In future, papers from Europe and Australasia will continue to be handled by the UK Editorial Office but, in addition to papers from the Americas, those from Asia, Africa and the Middle East should be sent to the US Editorial Office.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":164},"references":0,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
