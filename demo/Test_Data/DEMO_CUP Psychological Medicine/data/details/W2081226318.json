Principal factors analysis of the GHQ yielded 8 factors which were named: poor performance (which accounted for 63·3 % of total variance), depression-anxiety, sleep-disturbance, anhedonia-anergia, loss of confidence, general illness, social dysfunction and headache. These results were compared with previous principal components analyses of the GHQ (Goldberg, 1972; Goldberg et al. 1976). A multiple regression analysis indicated that age and 7 of the 8 factors were significantly related to the number of role problems reported by the patients. However, it appears that psychiatric distress (as measured by the GHQ) and role problems were only related to a small degree (multiple R 2 = 12·69% only).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":20},"references":18,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
