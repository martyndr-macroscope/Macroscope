Our objective was to determine whether factors derived from early signs and symptoms are differentially associated with non-affective versus affective psychosis. Method A principal components factor analysis was performed on early signs and symptoms reported by 128 individuals with first-episode psychosis. Factor scores were examined for their associations with duration of untreated illness, drug abuse prior to onset of psychosis, and diagnosis (schizophrenia versus affective psychosis). Results Of the 27 early signs and symptoms reported by patients, depression and anxiety were the most frequent. Five factors were identified based on these early signs and symptoms: depression, disorganization/mania, positive symptoms, negative symptoms and social withdrawal. Longer duration of untreated illness was associated with higher levels of depression and social withdrawal. Individuals with a history of drug abuse prior to the onset of psychosis scored higher on pre-psychotic depression and negative symptoms. The two mood-related factors, depression and disorganization/mania, distinguished the eventual first-episode diagnosis of affective psychosis from schizophrenia. Individuals with affective psychosis were also more likely to have a ‘mood-related’ sign and symptom as their first psychiatric change than individuals later diagnosed with schizophrenia. Conclusions Factors derived from early signs and symptoms reported by a full diagnostic spectrum sample of psychosis can have implications for future diagnostic trajectories. The findings are a step forward in the process of understanding and characterizing clinically important phenomena to be observed prior to the onset of psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":68},"references":47,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
