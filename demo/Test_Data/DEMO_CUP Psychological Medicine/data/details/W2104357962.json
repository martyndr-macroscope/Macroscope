First-admission psychotic patients with schizophrenia ( N = 96), major depression ( N = 42), and bipolar disorder ( N = 64) drawn from 10 facilities in Suffolk County, New York, were assessed during their initial hospitalization and at 6–month follow-up. Longitudinal consensus diagnoses were determined after the 6-month interview. The diagnostic groups shared similar background characteristics, but schizophrenics had poorer pre-morbid adjustment, longer periods of psychosis before hospitalization and more negative symptoms initially. Except for rehospitalization, schizophrenics had the worst and bipolars the best functioning at follow-up. Among the classical prognostic indicators, the best predictor of 6-month outcome for each diagnostic group was premorbid functioning.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":57},"references":34,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
