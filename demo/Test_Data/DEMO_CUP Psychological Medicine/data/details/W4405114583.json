To simplify the seemingly complex relationships underlying such comorbidity, methods that include multiple measures to distill which specific addictions are uniquely associated with specific mental health disorders rather than due to the co-occurrence of other related addictions or mental health disorders can be used. Methods In a general population sample of Jewish adults in Israel ( N = 4002), network analysis methods were used to create partial correlation networks of continuous measures of problematic substance (non-medical use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and prescription sedatives, stimulants, and opioid painkillers) and behavioral (gambling, electronic gaming, sexual behavior, pornography, internet, social media, and smartphone) addictions and common mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), adjusted for all variables in the model. Results Strongest associations were observed within these clusters: (1) PTSD, anxiety, and depression; (2) problematic substance use and gambling; (3) technology-based addictive behaviors; and (4) problematic sexual behavior and pornography. In terms of comorbidity, the strongest unique associations were observed for PTSD and problematic technology-based behaviors (social media, smartphone), and sedatives and stimulants use; depression and problematic technology-based behaviors (gaming, internet) and sedatives and cannabis use; and anxiety and problematic smartphone use. Conclusions Network analysis isolated unique relationships underlying the observed comorbidity between common mental health problems and addictions, such as associations between mental health problems and technology-based behaviors, which is informative for more focused interventions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":8},"references":105,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
