Marital status is a strong correlate of psychiatric morbidity in adulthood, but debate continues on how far this association reflects causal influences or selection effects based on prior psychological characteristics. Method. Prospective data from the National Child Development Study were used to examine effects of adolescent emotional and behavioural problems on transitions into and out of first partnerships, and their implications for psychiatric morbidity at age 33. Results. Emotional and behavioural problems in adolescence showed systematic links with early partnership transitions (age at partnership formation, type of first partnership, and risks of first partnership breakdown). More detailed tests suggested that these effects only accounted for a modest proportion of the associations between partnership status and psychiatric morbidity at age 33. Conclusions. In a non-referred community sample selection effects associated with adolescent emotional and behavioural problems appear to play only a modest role in links between partnership status and adult mental health.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":22},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
