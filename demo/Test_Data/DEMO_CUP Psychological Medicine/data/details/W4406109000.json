Social determinants of psychosis and PLEs are important and have been operationalized within the social defeat (SD) hypothesis. The SD hypothesis posits that low social status and exposure to repeated humiliation can lead to imbalanced dopamine neuron activity, and thus increased risk of psychosis. We aimed to assess the role of dynamic interactions between SD components in shaping the occurrence of PLEs using a network analysis. Methods A total of 2241 non-clinical, young adults were assessed at baseline and invited for reassessment after a 6-month follow-up. Self-reports recording the occurrence of PLEs, aberrant salience (AS), depressive, and anxiety symptoms as well as SD characteristics (socioeconomic status, minority status, humiliation, perceived constraints, and domain control) were administered. Two networks were analyzed (the first one covering all baseline measures and the second one with the baseline SD components and follow-up measures of AS and psychopathology). Results The SD components were not directly connected to the measures of PLEs in both networks. However, in both networks, SD components were connected to PLEs through a mediating effect of AS. Among SD components, humiliation had the highest bridge centrality across three predefined communities of variables (SD; depressive and anxiety symptoms; AS, and PLEs). Conclusions The findings indicate that SD might make individuals vulnerable to develop PLEs through the mediating effects of AS. Among SD components, humiliation might play the most important role in the development of PLEs.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":1},"references":61,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
