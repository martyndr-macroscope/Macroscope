(2016) argue that discussion of the 5-HTTLPR-stress gene-environment interaction (G × E) (Caspi et al. 2003) is more positive than merited because authors often cast negative results as positive in abstracts, and negative papers with positive focus are differentially cited. These bold claims deserve careful scrutiny. Four methodological choices we highlight bias their primary results; the vast majority of papers disclose mixed and negative results in their abstracts (Table 1). Further, even if positive focus was prevalent, it could not bias meta-analytic results. The field can best move forward by ameliorating environmental measurement.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":36,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
