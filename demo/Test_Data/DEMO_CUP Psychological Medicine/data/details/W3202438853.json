Methods We investigated the dynamic functional connectivity (FC) by using instantaneous phase method based on Hilbert transform to detect abnormal spatiotemporal interaction in schizophrenia. Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, two independent datasets were included, with 114 subjects from COBRE [51 schizophrenia patients (SZ) and 63 healthy controls (HCs)] and 96 from OpenfMRI (36 SZ and 60 HCs). Phase differences and instantaneous coupling matrices were firstly calculated at all time points by extracting instantaneous parameters. Global [global synchrony and intertemporal closeness (ITC)] and local dynamic features [strength of FC (sFC) and variability of FC (vFC)] were compared between two groups. Support vector machine (SVM) was used to estimate the ability to discriminate two groups by using all aberrant features. Results We found SZ had lower global synchrony and ITC than HCs on both datasets. Furthermore, SZ had a significant decrease in sFC but an increase in vFC, which were mainly located at prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, temporal cortex and visual cortex or temporal cortex and hippocampus, forming significant dynamic subnetworks. SVM analysis revealed a high degree of balanced accuracy (85.75%) on the basis of all aberrant dynamic features. Conclusions SZ has worse overall spatiotemporal stability and extensive FC subnetwork lesions compared to HCs, which to some extent elucidates the pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia, providing insight into time-variation properties of patients with other mental illnesses.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":9},"references":71,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
