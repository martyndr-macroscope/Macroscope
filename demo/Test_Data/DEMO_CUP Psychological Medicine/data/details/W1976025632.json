With respect to the measures used and pilot study objectives identified, there were no statistically significant differences between the study groups in treatment adherence to the prescription of antidepressant medication or in the incidence and severity of adverse events to medication. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are in progress to assess the effectiveness of practice nurse interventions in the management of depressive illness in general practice.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":49},"references":4,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
