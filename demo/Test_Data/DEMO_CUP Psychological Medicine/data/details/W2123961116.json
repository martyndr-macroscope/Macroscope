Most studies have been of populations selected by age and/or gender. We investigate these associations with depression, myocardial infarction (MI), or both, in a large general population sample. Method A cross-sectional population study of 9258 women and men aged ⩾20 years. The study included clinical examination, self-report of MI and depression and factors known to confound their associations. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Elevated high sensitive-CRP was defined as values &gt;2.2 mg/l. Results The association of elevated CRP with depression was attenuated towards the null [from odds ratio (OR) 1.28, p =0.001 to OR 1.08, p =0.388] following extensive adjustment, while associations with MI (adjusted OR 1.42, p =0.032) and co-morbid MI and depression (adjusted OR 2.66, p =0.003) persisted. Confounders associated with elevated CRP levels were smoking (OR 1.66; p &lt;0.001), chronic physical illness (OR 1.34, p &lt;0.001), BMI ⩾30 (OR 1.13, p &lt;0.001), employment (OR 0.70, p &lt;0.001) and high coffee consumption (OR 0.83, p =0.017). Interaction tests indicated a lower effect of old age (OR 0.54, p &lt;0.001) and smoking (OR 0.63, p &lt;0.001) on elevated CRP levels in women compared with men. Conclusions CRP levels were raised in those with MI and co-morbid MI and depression; the positive association with depression was explained by confounding factors. We found new evidence that might help understand gender-specific patterns. Future studies should explore the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning these interrelations and their relevance for treatment of these conditions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":37},"references":36,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
