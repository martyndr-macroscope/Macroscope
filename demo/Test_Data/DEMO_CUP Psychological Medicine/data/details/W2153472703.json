In most cases hallucinations were auditory. When compared with a group of 20 controls matched on these differentiating features, the 20 children with hallucinations had more precipitants of illness, a shorter duration of the disorder, symptoms of depression, and a family history of mood changes. They also had more symptoms suggestive of cognitive–perceptual dysfunction.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":106},"references":32,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
