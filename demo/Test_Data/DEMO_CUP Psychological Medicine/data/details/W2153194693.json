The women were later interviewed at home and a standardized psychiatric interview administered. Relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the optimum cut-off point on the GHQ-30. Thirty-five per cent of the women were high scorers on the GHQ-30 (≥6) and 29% were found to be ‘cases’ at interview (CIS Overall Severity Rating ≥2).","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":36},"references":28,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
