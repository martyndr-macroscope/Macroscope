While manic and depressive symptoms can alternate and co-occur, most of the studies in early intervention investigated these symptoms independently. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the co-occurrence of manic and depressive dimensions, their evolution and impact on outcomes. Methods We prospectively studied first-episode psychosis patients ( N = 313) within an early intervention program over 3 years. Based on latent transition analysis, we identified sub-groups of patients with different mood profiles considering both manic and depressive dimensions, and studied their outcomes. Results Our results revealed six different mood profiles at program entry and after 1.5 years follow-up (absence of mood disturbance, co-occurrence, mild depressive, severe depressive, manic and hypomanic), and four after 3 years (absence of mood disturbance, co-occurrence, mild depressive and hypomanic). Patients with absence of mood disturbance at discharge had better outcomes. All patients with co-occurring symptoms at program entry remained symptomatic at discharge. Patients with mild depressive symptoms were less likely to return to premorbid functional level at discharge than the other subgroups. Patients displaying a depressive component had poorer quality of physical and psychological health at discharge. Conclusions Our results confirm the major role played by mood dimensions in early psychosis, and show that profiles with co-occurring manic and depressive dimensions are at risk of poorer outcome. An accurate assessment and treatment of these dimensions in people with early psychosis is crucial.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":47,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
