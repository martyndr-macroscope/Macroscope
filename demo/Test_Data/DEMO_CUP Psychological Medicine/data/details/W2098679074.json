Both tests were impaired in patients at inclusion, but only verbal fluency normalized with successful treatment of depression. VFT impairment is consistent with the hypothesis of a left prefrontal cortex dysfunction in depression. Moreover, the persistence of an impaired performance on SCWT in patients at discharge suggests that a selective attention deficit may persist in patients beyond a clear clinical improvement.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":222},"references":45,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
