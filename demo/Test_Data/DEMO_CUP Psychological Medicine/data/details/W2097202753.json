CPZ plasma levels were measured by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry method (GCMS) using 2 H 6 -chlorpromazine as an internal standard. At the end of the fixed-dose period, ‘responders’ had the same plasma levels as ‘non-responders’, suggesting that lack of response is primarily a matter of the illness' sensitivity to CPZ, not to a plasma level below some therapeutic window. After the fixed-dose period, the dosage of CPZ was increased in the ‘non-responders’ by physician's choice. Improvement occurred over a wide range of 10–225 picomoles (3–72 ng)/ml. Above 300 picomoles (95 ng/ml) 4 inaccessible patients eventually became much worse, suggesting psychotoxicity. It is in the inaccessible patient whose illness is only minimally, or not at all, sensitive to CPZ that a plasma level might be especially useful. Interpretation of plasma levels is complicated by the speed of response: some initial non-responders improved by the 56th day of treatment on very conservative plasma levels.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":37},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
