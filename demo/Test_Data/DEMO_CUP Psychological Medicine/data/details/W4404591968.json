People with mental illnesses are at higher risk of preventable diseases than the general population, partly attributable to lower MVPA and higher SB. Self-determination theory provides a framework for understanding how motivation regulates behavior. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of different forms of motivation for physical activity (amotivation, controlled, autonomous) to MVPA and SB in people with mental illnesses. Methods Cross-sectional self-reported and accelerometer-derived MVPA and SB in people with a range of mental illnesses across four countries were pooled for analysis (Australia, Belgium, England, Uganda). Motivation for physical activity was measured using the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ). Regression analyses were used to investigate the association of MVPA and SB with amotivation, controlled, autonomous motivations, controlling for mental health and demographic variables. Results Autonomous motivation was associated with 31% higher self-reported MVPA, and amotivation and controlled motivation were associated with 18% and 11% lower self-reported MVPA, respectively ( n = 654). In contrast, controlled motivation was positively associated with SB ( n = 189). Having physical comorbidities or an alcohol use disorder was associated with lower MVPA ( n = 318). Sub-analyses with accelerometer-derived MVPA and SB ( n = 139 and n = 145) did not reveal any associations with motivational forms. Conclusions Findings with an international sample support the universal relevance of motivation in promoting health-related behavior. Strategies for facilitating autonomous motivation should be utilized by health professionals seeking to support people with mental illnesses to become physically active.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":62,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
