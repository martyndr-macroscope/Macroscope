The GHQ total score discriminated ‘cases’ and ‘non-cases’ satisfactorily but its recommended cut-off point was higher (7/8) than that of the original English version (4/5). Discriminant function analysis revealed that only 13 items contributed to the discriminatory power and that their discriminant function score was better than a simple summation of the 30 GHQ item scores in terms of validity.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":67},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
