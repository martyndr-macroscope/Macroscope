Method The data for this study came from a randomized controlled trial of three forms of CBT delivery for PD with and without agoraphobia (two 6-week CBT programmes, one of which was computer assisted, and one therapist-directed 12-week CBT programme), comprising a total of 186 patients across two sites. Based on previous related research, five hypothesized predictors of post-treatment and follow-up outcome were identified and examined, using a series of bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results The results in general supported the hypotheses. Strength of blood/injury fears, age of initial onset of panic symptoms, co-morbid social anxieties and degree of agoraphobic avoidance were predictive of both measures of post-treatment outcome. Degree of residual social difficulties and the continued use of anxiolytics at post-treatment were also shown to predict poor outcome at the 6-month follow-up. However, strength of continuing dysfunctional agoraphobic cognitions by the end of active treatment did not predict outcome at follow-up for the sample as a whole. Conclusions The identification of consistent predictors of outcome with CBT has many clinical and research benefits. As CBT, however, is being delivered increasingly in a variety of brief formats, further research is required to identify moderators of response to these ‘non-standard’ treatment formats.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":35},"references":55,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
