Comparison of responders' and nonresponders' ability to perform activities of daily living, and examination of the relative difficulty level of omitted items indicates that, in epidemiological surveys, scoring nonresponse as error is more likely to be correct.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":79},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
