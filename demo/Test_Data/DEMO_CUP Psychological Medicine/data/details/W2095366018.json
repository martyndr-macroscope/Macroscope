Increased thyroid activity, as measured by the free thyroxine index (FTI), was present in 16 (24%) of the patients. Patients with blunted responses had a higher mean FTI level than those with normal responses. Patients with blunted responses were significantly more likely to exhibit the symptoms of depersonalization, derealization and agitation. There was no clear association between blunting and any particular diagnostic category of depression. Patients with blunted responses and high FTI values were more likely to report significant long-term environmental difficulties than patients with blunted responses and normal FTI values. It is suggested that there may be more than one mechanism responsible for blunting of the TSH response in depressed patients. In some patients blunting may be due to negative feedback from increased output of thyroid hormones, possibly released as part of a stress response. In other patients blunting may be due to a different mechanism, possibly involving pituitary gland dysfunction. These mechanisms would not necessarily be mutually exclusive in any one patient.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":50},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
