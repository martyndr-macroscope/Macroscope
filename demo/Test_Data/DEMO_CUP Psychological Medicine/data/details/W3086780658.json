This study aims to examine the efficacy of adjunctive bright light therapy with gradual timing advance in a randomized, assessor and prescriber-blinded controlled trial. Method Participants were randomly allocated to receive 5 weeks of either bright white light therapy (BLT) or dim red light (DRL) with the same advancement protocol. Participants were followed up till 5 months after treatment. Primary outcomes included (i) remission rate and (ii) the severity of depression. The analysis was conducted using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard analysis and linear mixed models. Results A total of 93 participants (46.4 ± 11.7 years old, 80% female) were randomized. The cumulative remission rate for the BLT and the DRL groups was 67.4% and 46.7%, respectively. Time to remission was shorter for the BLT group relative to the DRL group (log-rank test p = 0.024). Cox proportional hazard survival analysis showed that patients in the BLT group had a higher probability of achieving remission relative to patients in the DRL group [hazard ratio = 1.9 (95% CI = 1.1– 3.4), p = 0.026]. Further sensitivity analysis demonstrated greater improvement in 17-Hamilton Depression Score (group × time interaction, p = 0.04) in the BLT group for those who were adherent to light therapy. Conclusions The use of bright light therapy with gradual advance protocol is an effective adjunctive treatment resulting in quicker and a higher rate of remission of depression in patients with non-seasonal unipolar depression and evening-chronotype.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":38},"references":47,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
