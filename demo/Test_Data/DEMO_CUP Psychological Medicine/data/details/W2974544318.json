Here we used the 5-HT 4 receptor partial agonist prucalopride to assess the translatability of these effects and characterise, for the first time, the consequences of 5-HT 4 receptor activation on human cognition and emotion. Methods Forty one healthy volunteers were randomised, double-blind, to a single dose of prucalopride (1 mg) or placebo in a parallel group design. They completed a battery of cognitive tests measuring learning and memory, emotional processing and reward sensitivity. Results Prucalopride increased recall of words in a verbal learning task, increased the accuracy of recall and recognition of words in an incidental emotional memory task and increased the probability of choosing a symbol associated with a high likelihood of reward or absence of loss in a probabilistic instrumental learning task. Thus acute prucalopride produced pro-cognitive effects in healthy volunteers across three separate tasks. Conclusions These findings are a translation of the memory enhancing effects of 5-HT 4 receptor agonism seen in animal studies, and lend weight to the idea that the 5-HT 4 receptor could be an innovative target for the treatment of cognitive deficits associated with depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Contrary to the effects reported in animal models, prucalopride did not reveal an antidepressant profile in human measures of emotional processing.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":73},"references":60,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
