Only 22 patients had a diagnosable psychiatric syndrome or personality disorder at follow-up. Twenty-three patients continued to have findings of functional visual loss at follow-up. Despite continued signs of functional visual loss, few were socially or economically impaired, and 8 of these 23 patients had no evidence of any psychiatric disorder. The implications of these findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":51},"references":10,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
