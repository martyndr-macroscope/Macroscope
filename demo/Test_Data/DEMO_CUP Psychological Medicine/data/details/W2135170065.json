About 30% of primary care patients were found to have at least one Research Diagnostic Criteria mental disorder, five-sixths of which had a duration greater than 1 year. However, about 9% of patients had some impairment and 2% had severe impairment associated with a mental disorder. Although affective disorders have the highest overall rates, personality, psychotic, and anxiety disorders contribute the greatest proportion of severe disability.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":58},"references":30,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
