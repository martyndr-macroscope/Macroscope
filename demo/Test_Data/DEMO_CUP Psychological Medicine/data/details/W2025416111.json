The theory stated that images of objects of desire or aversion aroused emotions, which in turn set up humoral imbalances, disturbing digestion and other vital functions, culminating in various forms of pathology. This concept explained the therapeutic efficacy of ‘placebos’ in forms such as spells, charms and talismans. The theory merits close attention by contemporary physicians and researchers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":24},"references":5,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
