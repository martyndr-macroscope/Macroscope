The patients displayed significantly greater ventricular and sulcal enlargement when compared to control subjects. There were no relationships between the CT scan appearance and clinical indices of illness severity or weight loss in the patient group. In 14 patients who had repeat scans after attaining normal body weight, no significant change was observed in the ventricular appearance, but there was a significant lessening in the degree of sulcal widening.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":73},"references":26,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
