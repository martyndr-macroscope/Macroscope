Because the relevant literature is largely informal, the seriousness of these risks is difficult to evaluate. Methods Searches were made for case reports of schizophrenia-spectrum, affective or other psychiatric disorders after use of psychedelic drugs. Case reports of flashbacks were also searched for. Individuals with recent use of other drugs (apart from cannabis and alcohol) and/or a previous history of major psychiatric disorder were excluded. Symptoms were tabulated using the Syndrome Check List of the Present State Examination (PSE-9). Results We found 17 case reports of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 17 of affective disorder (depression, mania, or both), 3 cases of anxiety, 1 of depersonalization, and 1 of unclassifiable illness. The states could develop after a single use of the drug (5/17 schizophrenia; 6/17 affective disorder), and duration was highly variable. Recovery was the rule in cases of affective disorder but not in schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Twelve of 29 cases of flashbacks showed psychiatric symptomatology definitely outlasting the attacks, mainly anxiety (5 cases) and depression (8 cases). Flashback symptoms resolved within twelve months in approximately half of the cases but in a few persisted for years. Conclusions Reliable descriptions of schizophrenia spectrum disorder and major affective disorder after psychedelic drug use disorder exist but are relatively uncommon. Flashbacks are sometimes but not always associated with psychiatric symptomatology, mainly anxiety or depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":93,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
