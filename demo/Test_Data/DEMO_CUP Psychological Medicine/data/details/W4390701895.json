Early life risk factors of multimorbidity include adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), particularly associated with psychological conditions and weight problems. Few studies have considered related mechanisms and focus on old age participants. We are interested in estimating, from young adulthood, the risk of overweight-depression comorbidity related to ACEs while adjusting for early life confounders and intermediate variables. Methods We used data from the 1958 National Child Development Study, a prospective birth cohort study ( N = 18 558). A four-category outcome (no condition, overweight only, depression only and, overweight-depression comorbidity) was constructed at 23, 33, and 42 years. Multinomial logistic regression models adjusting for intermediate variables co-occurring with this outcome were created. ACEs and sex interaction on comorbidity risk was tested. Results In our study sample ( N = 7762), we found that ACEs were associated with overweight-depression comorbidity risk throughout adulthood (RRR [95% CI] at 23y = 3.80 [2.10–6.88]) though less overtime. Comorbidity risk was larger than risk of separate conditions. Intermediate variables explained part of the association. After full-adjustment, an association remained (RRR [95% CI] at 23y = 2.00 [1.08–3.72]). Comorbidity risk related to ACEs differed by sex at 42. Conclusion Our study provides evidence on the link and potential mechanisms between ACEs and the co-occurrence of mental and physical diseases throughout the life-course. We suggest addressing ACEs in intervention strategies and public policies to go beyond single disease prevention.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":5},"references":46,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
