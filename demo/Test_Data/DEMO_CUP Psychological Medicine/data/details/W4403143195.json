Identification of risk for depressive disorders (DD) in this key developmental stage can help prevention efforts, mitigating the clinical and public burden of DD. While frequently used in diagnosis, nonverbal behaviors are relatively understudied as risk markers for DD. Digital technology, such as facial recognition, may provide objective, fast, efficient, and cost-effective means of measuring nonverbal behavior. Method Here, we analyzed video-recorded clinical interviews of 359 never-depressed adolescents females via commercially available facial emotion recognition software. Results We found that average head and facial movements forecast future first onset of depression (AUC = 0.70) beyond the effects of other established self-report and physiological markers of DD risk. Conclusions Overall, these findings suggest that digital assessment of nonverbal behaviors may provide a promising risk marker for DD, which could aid in early identification and intervention efforts.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":76,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
