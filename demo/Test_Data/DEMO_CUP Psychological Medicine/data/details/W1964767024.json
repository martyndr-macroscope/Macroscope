The results pointed to the existence of a sub-group of patients with severe behavioural problems. These patients had had more psychiatric admissions, and had spent a longer total time in hospital. The proportion of forms of behaviour regarded as problems by the relatives themselves was lower than that suggested by their assessments, except in the families where the patient exhibited severe behavioural difficulties. The findings are discussed in terms of the practical difficulties regarding home-management by relatives of the schizophrenic.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":17},"references":12,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
