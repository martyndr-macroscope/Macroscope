Although twenty-nine per cent scored above the threshold for the questionnaire (≥ 20), closer scrutiny of the pattern of responses revealed misinterpretations of a large number of questions possibly on a conceptual basis. Linguistic and conceptual pitfalls inherent to cross-cultural epidemiological research are discussed with reference to previous work.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":145},"references":20,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
