Their survival status at 7 years was determined, and 474 had died. Respondents whose GHQ score was above the conventional threshold (4/5), used when screening for psychiatric disorder, were 60% more likely to die over the 7-year interval than respondents whose GHQ score was below threshold (risk ratio 1·64 for men and 1·58 for women). The differences were statistically significant for both sexes when the effects of age, physical disorder, social class and smoking behaviour were taken into account. Personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion) were not related to mortality, neither was self-reported difficulty in sleeping. However, a low subjective rating of one's general health was associated with increased mortality. We explored a range of cut-points and found reliable effects for both sexes at all cut-points from 3/4 to 6/7. Possible differences related to natural versus unnatural causes of death were explored and found not to explain the results. The findings from this general population study confirm that it is not only psychiatric disorders, but also psychiatric symptoms, which are associated with subsequent mortality, and thereby reinforce the importance of appropriate intervention to alleviate these symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":150},"references":32,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
