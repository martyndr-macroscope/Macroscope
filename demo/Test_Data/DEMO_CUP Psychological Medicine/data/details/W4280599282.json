Despite its great clinical importance, the pathophysiology and prevalence across different diagnoses and mood states are still poorly understood. Actigraphy allows unbiased, objective, and naturalistic assessment of physical activity as a marker of psychomotor slowing. Yet, the true effect-sizes remain unclear as recent, large systematic reviews are missing. We conducted a novel meta-analysis on actigraphically measured slowing in depression with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria for diagnosis ascertainment and sample duplications. Medline/PubMed and Web-of-Science were searched with terms combining mood-keywords and actigraphy-keywords until September 2021. Original research measuring actigraphy for ⩾24 h in at least two groups of depressed, remitted, or healthy participants and applying operationalized diagnosis was included. Studies in somatically ill patients, N &lt; 10 participants/group, and studies using consumer-devices were excluded. Activity-levels between groups were compared using random-effects models with standardized-mean-differences and several moderators were examined. In total, 34 studies ( n = 1804 patients) were included. Patients had lower activity than controls [standardized mean difference ( s.m.d.) = −0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.99 to −0.57]. Compared to controls, patients with unipolar and bipolar disorder had lower activity than controls whether in depressed (unipolar: s.m.d. = −0.82, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.56; bipolar: s.m.d. = −0.94, 95% CI −1.41 to −0.46), or remitted/euthymic mood (unipolar: s.m.d. = −0.28, 95% CI −0.56 to 0.0; bipolar: s.m.d. = −0.92, 95% CI −1.36 to −0.47). None of the examined moderators had any significant effect. To date, this is the largest meta-analysis on actigraphically measured slowing in mood disorders. They are associated with lower activity, even in the remitted/euthymic mood-state. Studying objective motor behavior via actigraphy holds promise for informing screening and staging of affective disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":35},"references":101,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
