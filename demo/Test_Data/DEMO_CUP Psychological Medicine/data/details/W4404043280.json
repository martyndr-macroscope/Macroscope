This study investigated sex differences in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom severity based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV, DSM-IV(TR), and DSM-5 criteria, separating rating scale and clinical interview data in children and adults with ADHD. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus were searched for published studies (1996–2021) reporting severity of attention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity in males and females. We compared data: (1) across the entire lifespan aggregating rating scale and clinical interview data (51 studies), (2) drawing solely on rating scale data (18 studies), and (3) drawing solely on clinical interview data (33 studies). Fifty-two studies met inclusion criteria comparing data for females ( n = 8423) and males ( n = 9985) with ADHD across childhood and/or adulthood. In total, 15 meta-analyses were conducted. Pooled data across the lifespan aggregating both rating scale and clinical diagnostic interview data, showed males had significantly more severe hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms than females. Rating scale data were similar; boys had significantly more severe hyperactivity/impulsivity than girls. In adulthood, men were rated to have significantly more severe inattention than women with no difference in the hyperactivity/impulsivity dimension. All significant differences were of small effect size. No significant sex differences in the severity of symptoms emerged for clinical interview data for children or adults, in contrast. Possible reasons for the discrepancy in findings between rating scales and clinical diagnostic interviews are discussed.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":9},"references":96,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
