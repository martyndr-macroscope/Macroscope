Patients preferred healthy others over being with fellow sufferers or alone, and avoided illness as a discussion topic. Secondary preference for being alone rather than with co-patients rose slightly with reported anxiety. Findings contradict the emotional comparison hypothesis that misery seeks out co-sufferers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":6},"references":5,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
