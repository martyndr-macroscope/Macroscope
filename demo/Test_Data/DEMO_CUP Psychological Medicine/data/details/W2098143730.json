Dementia according to DSM-III-R criteria was diagnosed in 23·3% of all patients (95% confidence interval: 17·1 to 32·4%). Dementia and cognitive impairment were associated with overall measures of Parkinsonian impairment and rigidity, but not tremor, even after controlling for age, sex and education.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":36},"references":39,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
