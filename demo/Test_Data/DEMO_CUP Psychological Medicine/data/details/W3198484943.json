Methods In the Swedish general population born 1932–1995 and followed through 2017 ( n = 7 661 519), we calculate family genetic risk scores (FGRS) for SA, SD, MD, BD, SZ, AUD, and DUD. Registration for SA and SD was assessed from Swedish national registers. Results In univariate and multivariate models predicting SA, FGRS were highest for SA, AUD, DUD, and MD. In univariate models predicting SD, the strongest FGRS were AUD, DUD, SA, and SD. In multivariate models, the FGRS for SA and AUD were higher in predicting SA while the FGRS for SD, BD, and SZ were higher in predicting SD. Higher FGRS for all disorders significantly predicted both younger age at first SA and frequency of attempts. For SD, higher FGRS for MD, AUD, and SD predicted later age at SD. Mediation of FGRS effects on SA and SD was more pronounced for SD than SA, strongest for AUD, DUD, and SZ FGRS and weakest for MD. Conclusions FGRS for both SA and SD and for our five psychiatric disorders impact on risk for SA and SD in a complex manner. While some of the impact of genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders on risk for SA and SD is mediated through developing the disorders, these risks also predispose directly to suicidal behaviors.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":15,"cited_by_count":37},"references":50,"networkCitations":15,"seed":false}
