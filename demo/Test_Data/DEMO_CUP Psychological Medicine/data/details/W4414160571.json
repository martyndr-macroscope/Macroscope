Better characterizing predictors of trajectories of suicidal ideation (SI) post-discharge is critical. Method We examined trajectories of SI over 18 months post-discharge and emotional processing variables (recognition, reactivity, and regulation) as predictors using a multi-method approach. Participants were 180 adolescents recruited from a pediatric psychiatric inpatient unit, assessed during hospitalization and 3, 6, 12, and 18-months post-discharge. At each time-point, participants reported on SI; at baseline, they completed measures of emotion dysregulation, reactivity, and a behavioral task measuring facial emotion recognition. Results A three-group model best fits the data (Chronic SI, Declining SI, and Subthreshold SI groups). The Chronic SI group, compared to the Declining SI group, had greater difficulty identifying children’s sad facial expressions. The Declining SI group compared to the Subthreshold SI group reported greater overall emotion dysregulation and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior. No other emotional processing variable was significantly associated with specific SI trajectories. Conclusions The findings suggest that difficulties in properly identifying peer emotions may be predictive of resolution of severe SI post-discharge. Furthermore, the results suggest that emotion regulation may be an important target for discharge planning.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":46,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
