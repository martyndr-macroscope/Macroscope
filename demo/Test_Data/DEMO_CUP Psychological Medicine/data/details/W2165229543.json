The results indicated that the Irish subjects had more obsessional symptoms and traits and also that they appeared to be more disturbed by the possession of such attributes than did the English. Among the various cultural factors considered, the bachelor state, in the case of the Irish males, and rural dwelling, in the case of Irish females, were associated with the highest obsessional scores. Ways in which the cultural background may be related to the development of obsessional symptoms and traits are discussed and suggestions are made as to the further epidemiological implications of these findings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":28},"references":37,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
