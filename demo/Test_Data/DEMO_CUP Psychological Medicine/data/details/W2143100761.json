By contrast, an interest in the form of the symptomatology is usually minimal. This paper draws on Karl Jaspers' phenomenological views and focuses on some important albeit neglected psychopathological issues related to form which are relevant to any comprehensive consideration of lycanthropic phenomena.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":18},"references":12,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
