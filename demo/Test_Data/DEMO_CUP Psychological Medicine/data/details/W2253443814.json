Understanding risk factors at this time is important to guide intervention. The current objective was to investigate the associations between maternal symptoms of D&amp;A with offspring symptoms during their transition to adulthood. Method Data from a large population-based birth cohort study, in South Brazil, were used. Prospective associations between maternal D&amp;A and offspring risk of these symptoms during the transition to adulthood (18/19, 24 and 30 years) were estimated. Results Maternal D&amp;A in adolescence was associated with offspring symptoms across the transition to adulthood, associations were consistently stronger for females than for males. Daughters whose mothers reported D&amp;A were 4.6 times (95% confidence interval 2.71–7.84) as likely to report D&amp;A at all three time-points, than daughters of symptom-free mothers. Conclusions Maternal D&amp;A is associated with persistent D&amp;A during the daughter's transition to adulthood. Intervention strategies should consider the mother's mental health.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":40},"references":27,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
