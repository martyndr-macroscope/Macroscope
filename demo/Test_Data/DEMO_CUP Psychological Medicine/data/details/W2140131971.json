The current study paper took into account the recency of risk when testing for differences among child-, adolescent- and young adult-onset depressions. Method Up to nine waves of data were used per subject from two cohorts of the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS; n =1004), covering children in the community aged 9–16, 19 and 21 years. Youth and one of their parents were interviewed using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA) between ages 9 and 16; these same youth were interviewed using the Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment (YAPA) at ages 19 and 21. The most common psychosocial risk factors for depression were assessed: poverty, life events, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, and family dysfunction. Results Consistent with previous research, most childhood psychosocial risk factors were more strongly associated with child-onset than with adolescent-/adult-onset depression. When potentially genuine risk differences among the depression-onset groups were disentangled from differences due to the recency of risk, child- and young adult-onset depression were no longer different from one another. Adolescent-onset depression was associated with few psychosocial risk factors. Conclusions There were no differences in putative risk factors between child- and young adult-onset depression when the recency of risk was taken into account. Adolescent-onset depression was associated with few psychosocial risk factors. It is possible that some adolescent-onset depression cases differ in terms of risk from child- and young adult-onset depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":147},"references":48,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
