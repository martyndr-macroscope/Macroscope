However, the causal relationship between stress and subsequent cognitive impairment remains unclear, notably because of the small number of gender-stratified prospective studies. Method Salivary cortisol secretion was evaluated in 197 non-depressed community-dwelling elderly people at three time points on the day of hospital attendance for a clinical examination and again on the following day at home, in a distinct environmental context. Cognitive performance was evaluated at baseline and at 2- and 4-year follow-up. Results Cross-sectional logistic analyses adjusted for age and education indicated that men with high morning cortisol at the hospital had higher risk of low cognitive performance in verbal fluency [odds ratio (OR) 3.0, p =0.05] and visuospatial performance (OR 5.1, p =0.03). Impairment in verbal fluency was observed in women with moderate high morning cortisol (OR 3.6, p =0.05) or moderate slow diurnal rhythm (OR 3.7, p =0.04). In longitudinal analyses, slow diurnal rhythm (flatter slope) was associated with decline over 4 years in visuospatial performance (OR 7.7, p =0.03) and visual memory (OR 4.1, p =0.03) in men, and in verbal fluency (OR 6.0, p =0.01) in women. High morning cortisol was associated with decline in visual memory in women (OR 5.1, p =0.06). Conclusions HPA axis dysregulation seems to be associated with low cognitive performance in the elderly. Slower cortisol elimination rates could predict cognitive decline affecting principally non-verbal functioning in men and verbal functioning in women. The effects are independent of environmental context, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or psychopathology. Interventions blocking this pathway may provide new therapeutic options to prevent cognitive decline.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":89},"references":45,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
