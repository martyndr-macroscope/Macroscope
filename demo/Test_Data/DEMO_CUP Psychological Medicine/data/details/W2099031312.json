There were 24 adolescent girls in the class, all in the 16 to 17 age group, and the class was involved in examinations. The school authorities decided to close down the class one week before the end of term, when eight girls and a young locum teacher lay unconscious on the floor. Most of the girls affected belonged to the ‘in group’: the very bright, the Greek, the Jewish, and the one coloured girl were unaffected. Although the school refused permission for a sociometric investigation, information was obtained from the school medical officer, from two teachers, and from the two girls who were clearly the most powerful members of the class and the protagonists of the epidemic. They were both referred for medical treatment and, after all physical investigations had proved negative, they were both admitted to a psychiatric hospital for observation and treatment. Their case histories are given in some detail, together with a ‘confession’ written by the girl who started the epidemic. This same girl, during the course of her hospital admission, started a ‘pseudo-pregnancy epidemic’ in her ward. It was discovered that one member of the class had left the school during the course of the previous trimester because she had become pregnant. The epidemic, which appears to follow her childbirth and subsequent death from cerebral haemorrhage, lasted from December to the following July. Possible dynamic factors are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":28},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
