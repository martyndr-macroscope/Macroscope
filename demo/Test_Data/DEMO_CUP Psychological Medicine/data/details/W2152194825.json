It noted that Australia had contributed with distinction in some areas, such as the neurosciences and immunology, whereas fields such as epidemiology and psychiatry were much less developed scientifically. As the principal source of funding for medical research, the NH &amp; MRC had hitherto supported projects, individuals and a small number of institutions (e.g. the Walter and Eliza Hall, the Florey and the Baker Institutes). The initiative adopted in 1974, as an additional commitment, was to establish some research units in areas of major relevance for public health. These were intended to become centres of excellence in fields where more expertise was needed at a national level.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":19,"cited_by_count":1},"references":81,"networkCitations":19,"seed":false}
