Total complement haemolytic activity was decreased in chronic schizophrenic patients as compared to healthy controls and bipolar patients. The relatively diminished total haemolytic activity was not attributable to drug treatment. It is not clear if the reduced total haemolytic activity is an epiphenomenon or related to the involvement of an autoimmune process in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":32},"references":9,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
