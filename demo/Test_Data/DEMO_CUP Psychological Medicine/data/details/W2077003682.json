Regression analysis revealed type of treatment, control over treatment and concern for appearance as significant predictors of nature of subsequent mood state. Results are discussed with reference to the theoretical position that type of severe life event can predict the nature of ensuing psychological disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":29},"references":19,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
