However, not all individuals who experience early adversity develop these inflammatory outcomes. Separately, there is also a link between various internalizing emotional distress conditions (e.g. depression, anxiety, and fear) and inflammation in adulthood. It is possible the combination of adult emotional distress and past childhood adversity may be uniquely important for explaining psychopathology-related immune dysfunction at midlife. Methods Using data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study ( n = 1255), we examined whether internalizing, defined as past 12-month emotional distress symptomatology and trait neuroticism, moderated associations between childhood adversity and heightened inflammation in adulthood. Using latent variable modeling, we examined whether transdiagnostic or disorder-specific features of emotional distress better predicted inflammation. Results We observed that childhood adversity only predicted adult inflammation when participants also reported adult internalizing emotional distress. Furthermore, this moderation effect was specific to the transdiagnostic factor of emotional distress rather than the disorder-specific features. Conclusions We discuss the possibility that adult internalizing symptoms and trait neuroticism together may signal the presence of temporally stable vulnerabilities that amplify the impact of childhood adversity on midlife immune alterations. The study highlights the importance of identifying emotional distress in individuals who have experienced childhood adversity to address long-term immune outcomes and enhance overall health.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":2},"references":89,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
