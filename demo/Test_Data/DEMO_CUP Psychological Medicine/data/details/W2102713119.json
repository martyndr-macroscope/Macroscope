Overall levels of support for this group were found to be moderately high and consistent over 6 months and were associated with greater psychological well-being. Individuals in receipt of quantitatively different levels of support were found to differ on measures of depression, stress, coping efficacy and self-esteem, while individuals in receipt of deficient levels of support were found to be more depressed. However, initial support levels were found to be the most powerful predictors of subsequent support levels. The implications of these findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":51},"references":33,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
