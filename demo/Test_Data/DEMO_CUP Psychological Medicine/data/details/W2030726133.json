The present study attempts to correlate measures of the erythrocyte membrane cation carrier with clinical events, remote in time from the biochemical assay. Erythrocyte sodium concentration, ouabain-sensitive potassium influx and Na-K ATPase were estimated in 11 patients before and after the cross-over point in a 2-year double blind clinical trial of lithium. Patients with the lowest erythrocyte Na-K ATPase and the highest flux sodium ATPase ratio tended to suffer most episodes of affective illness in the 2 years. Patients who had a low initial Na-K ATPase or a high initial flux sodium ATPase ratio, or in whom this ratio fell most with lithium or whose Na-K ATPase rose most with lithium, clinically responded best to lithium.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":41},"references":22,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
