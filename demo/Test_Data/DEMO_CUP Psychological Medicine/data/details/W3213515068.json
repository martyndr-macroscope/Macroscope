In this longitudinal study, we compare symptom trajectories and remission over the first 2 years of treatment in FEP with and without CIT and examine if differences are linked to the use of antipsychotics. Methods FEP ( N = 191) were recruited from in- and outpatient services 1997–2000, and assessed at baseline, 3 months, 1 and 2 years. Inclusion criteria were 15–65 years, actively psychotic with a DSM-IV diagnosis of psychotic disorder and no previous adequate treatment for psychosis. Antipsychotic medication is reported as defined daily dosage (DDD). CIT (&lt;18) was assessed with the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey, and symptomatic remission based on scores from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Results CIT ( n = 63, 33%) was not associated with symptomatic remission at 2 years follow-up (71% in remission, 14% in relapse), or time to first remission (CIT 12/ no-CIT 9 weeks, p = 0.51). Those with CIT had significantly more severe positive, depressive, and excited symptoms. FEP with physical ( N = 39, 20%) or emotional abuse ( N = 22, 14, 7%) had higher DDD at 1 year ( p &lt; 0.05). Mean DDD did not excerpt a significant between-group effect on symptom trajectories of positive symptoms. Conclusion Results indicate that antipsychotic medication is equally beneficial in the achievement of symptomatic remission in FEP after 2 years independent of CIT. Still, FEP patients with CIT had more severe positive, depressive, and excited symptoms throughout.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":7},"references":47,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
