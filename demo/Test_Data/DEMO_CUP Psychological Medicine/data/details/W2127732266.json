However, no study has established evidence of disorder-related impairment or whether distress is specifically related to PD rather than to co-morbid disorders. Method Three groups of normal-weight women [non-eating disorder controls ( n =38), with PD ( n =24), and with bulimia nervosa (BN)-purging subtype ( n =57)] completed structured clinical interviews and self-report assessments. Results Both PD and BN were associated with significant co-morbidity and elevations on indicators of distress and impairment compared to controls. Compared to BN, PD was associated with lower rates of current and lifetime mood disorders but higher rates of current anxiety disorders. Elevated distress and impairment were maintained in PD and BN after controlling for Axis I and Axis II disorders. Conclusions PD is associated with elevated distress and impairment and should be considered for inclusion as a provisional disorder in nosological schemes such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to facilitate much-needed research on this clinically significant syndrome.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":54},"references":38,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
