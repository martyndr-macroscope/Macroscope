IBS patients had significantly higher lifetime prevalence rates of major depression, current panic disorder, and childhood sexual abuse. Despite the absence of organic pathology, IBS patients had significantly higher numbers of medically unexplained physical symptoms and disability ratings equal to, or greater than, those of patients with severe organic gastrointestinal disease.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":181},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
