Method We asked Sz-AVHs ( n =29) and a non-voice-hearing general population sample ( n =42) a series of questions about their experiences of hearing voices, if present, and their inner speech. Results The inner speech reported by patients and controls was found to be almost identical in all respects. Furthermore, phenomenological qualities of AVHs (e.g. second- or third-person voices) did not relate to corresponding qualities in inner speech. Conclusions No discernable differences were found between the inner speech reported by Sz-AVHs and healthy controls. Implications for inner-speech theories of AVHs are discussed.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":76},"references":18,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
