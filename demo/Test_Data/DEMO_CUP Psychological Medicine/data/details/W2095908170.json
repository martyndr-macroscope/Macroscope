Several of the Chapmans' psychosis proneness scales were administered to a group of college students and their families. Evidence of at least some familial resemblance was found for both physical anhedonia and perceptual aberration, though it was stronger for anhedonia. Anhedonia and perceptual aberration appeared to be familially influenced independently of one another. Finally, the results indicated that offspring resembled their mothers more than they resembled their fathers on both anhedonia and perceptual aberration.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":36},"references":44,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
