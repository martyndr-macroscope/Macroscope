We aimed to establish a typology of the individual clinical trajectories based on detailed prospective medium-term follow-up. Method Latent class analysis (LCA) of nine characteristics of clinical course (time depressed, severity of depression, stability of depression, time manic, severity of mania, stability of mania, mixed symptoms, mania-to-depression and depression-to-mania phase switching) derived from life charts prospectively tracking the onsets and offsets of (hypo)manic, depressive, mixed and subsyndromal episodes in a representative sample of 176 patients with bipolar disorder. Results The best-fitting model separated patients with bipolar disorder into large classes of episodic bipolar (47%) and depressive type (32%), moderately sized classes characterized by prolonged hypomanias (10%) and mixed episodes (5%) and five small classes with unusual course characteristics including mania-to-depression and depression-to-mania transitions and chronic mixed affective symptoms. This empirical typology is relatively independent of the distinction between bipolar disorder type I and type II. Lifetime co-morbidity of alcohol use disorders is characteristic of the episodic bipolar course type. Conclusions There is potential for a new typology of clinical course based on medium-term naturalistic follow-up of a representative clinical sample of patients with bipolar disorder. Predictive validity and stability over longer follow-up periods remain to be established.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":18},"references":36,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
