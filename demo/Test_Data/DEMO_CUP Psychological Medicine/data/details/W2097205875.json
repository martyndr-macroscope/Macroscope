The characteristic heart rate deceleration shown immediately prior to the aversive stimulus by control subjects was absent in the schizophrenic group. Further features of this novel test paradigm distinguished the control and schizophrenic groups. This psychophysiological test procedure may be fruitful for schizophrenia research.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":11},"references":18,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
