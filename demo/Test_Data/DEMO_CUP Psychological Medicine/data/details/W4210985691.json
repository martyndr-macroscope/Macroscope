Given the evidence that sleep disturbance and alterations in interferon (IFN)- γ biology are associated with depression risk, this study examines the separate and joint contributions of poor sleep maintenance and IFN- γ to depressed mood in older adults. Methods Community-dwelling, non-depressed older adults ( n = 36, 72.1 ± 6.8 years) underwent a night of polysomnography to assess sleep maintenance [i.e. wake time after sleep onset (WASO)]. The morning after polysomnography, plasma levels of IFN- γ were evaluated along with self-reported depressed mood throughout the day. Multivariate linear regression tested associations of WASO and IFN- γ with the severity of depressed mood. In addition, moderation and mediation models examined the role of IFN- γ for the relationship between WASO and depressed mood. Results A greater amount of WASO ( p &lt; 0.05) and higher levels of IFN- γ ( p &lt; 0.01) were both associated with the severity of depressed mood. Moreover, IFN- γ moderated the relationship between WASO and depressed mood ( p &lt; 0.01), such that WASO was more strongly related to the depressed mood among those with higher IFN- γ , than among those with lower IFN- γ . However, IFN- γ did not mediate the relationship between WASO and depressed mood. Conclusion In this study of older adults, poor sleep maintenance and higher levels of IFN- γ were both related to depressed mood. Moreover, IFN- γ moderated the relationship between poor sleep maintenance and depressed mood. Together, these findings suggest that older adults with higher IFN- γ are at heightened risk for depressive symptoms following sleep disturbance.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":10},"references":75,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
