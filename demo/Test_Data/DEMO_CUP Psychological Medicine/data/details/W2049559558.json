The two types of scales were found to load on separate, but negatively correlated, factors. Furthermore, some differential correlates of the two types of scale were found, but the differences were not great. It was concluded that neurotic symptom and well-being scales do largely measure different ends of a single continuum, but well-being scales seem to have an extraversion component not shared by neurotic symptom scales. Subjective well-being measures may be useful in epidemiological surveys where it is desirable to discriminate among low symptom scorers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":21},"references":22,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
