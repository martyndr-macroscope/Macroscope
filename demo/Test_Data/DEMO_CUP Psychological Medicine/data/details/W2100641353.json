We aimed to assess types of psychotic outcomes after use of cannabis in adolescence and variation in risk over time. Method A cohort of 50 087 military conscripts with data on cannabis use in late adolescence was followed up during 35 years with regard to in-patient care for psychotic diagnoses. Results Odds ratios for psychotic outcomes among frequent cannabis users compared with non-users were 3.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3–5.8] for schizophrenia, 2.2 (95% CI 1.0–4.7) for brief psychosis and 2.0 (95% CI 0.8–4.7) for other non-affective psychoses. Risk of schizophrenia declined over the decades in moderate users but much less so in frequent users. The presence of a brief psychosis did not increase risk of later schizophrenia more in cannabis users compared with non-users. Conclusions Our results confirm an increased risk of schizophrenia in a long-term perspective, although the risk declined over time in moderate users.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":143},"references":27,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
