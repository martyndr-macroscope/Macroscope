After controlling for demographic and clinical risk factors, both sources of stress were significantly associated with the two measures of depression. On the other hand, neither the demographic and clinical risk factors, nor several psychosocial characteristics (social support, sense of mastery and organizational commitment) moderated the relationship between stress and depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":114},"references":67,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
