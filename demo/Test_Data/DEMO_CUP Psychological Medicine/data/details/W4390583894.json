Methods MD and AUD registrations were assessed from national Swedish registries. In individuals born in Sweden 1960–1970, we identified 7586, 388 459, and 34 370 with the loss of, respectively, a spouse, parent, and sibling. We started following subjects at age 18 or the year 2002 with end of follow-up in 2018. We examined time to event – a registration for MD within 6 months or AUD within a year – on an additive scale, using the Nelson–Aalen estimator. Genetic risk was assessed by the Family Genetic Risk Score (FGRS). Results In separate models controlling for the main effects of death of spouse, parent, and sibling, FGRS, and sex, significant interactions were seen in all analyses between genetic risk for MD and death of relative in prediction of subsequent MD registration. A similar pattern of results, albeit with weaker interaction effects, was seen for genetic risk for AUD and risk for AUD registration. Genetic risk for bipolar disorder (BD) and anxiety disorders (AD) also interacted with event exposure in predicting MD. Conclusions Genetic risk for both MD and AUD act in part by increasing the sensitivity of individuals to the pathogenic effects of environmental stressors. For prediction of MD, similar effects are also seen for genetic risk for AD and BD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":2},"references":57,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
