The various dependency scores of each subgroup were compared with the appropriate norms available for the SADQ. Compared with normal boys, epileptic boys of primary school age (N = 16) were generally found to be more in need of close physical emotional contact with their mother and her physical proximity when away from home, although they were less ready to talk to her about their practical problems and ask for her help. The needs of epileptic boys of secondary-school age (N = 18) were expressed more in terms of their mother's help with practical matters at home. In contrast, no significant differences were apparent between epileptic and normal girls at either level of schooling. In comparisons between epileptic children who consistently produced only generalized seizure activity in their EEG (N = 31), a right temporal spike discharge (N = 16) or a similar discharge on the left (N = 18), both boys and girls with a left temporal spike discharge tended to show significantly higher need for close physical emotional contact with their mother than children in the other electrographic groups. No clear relationship was seen between dependency scores and type of anti-epileptic drug treatment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":30},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
