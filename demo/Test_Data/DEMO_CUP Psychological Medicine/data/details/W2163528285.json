This measure coincided with the midpoint of a four-year survey into drug abuse which was being carried out in that area. This opportune timing created a natural experiment whereby it became possible to observe and measure the short- and long-term effects of a single social factor on one form of abnormal behaviour.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":34},"references":14,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
