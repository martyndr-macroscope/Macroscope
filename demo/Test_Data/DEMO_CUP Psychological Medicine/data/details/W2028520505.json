The present study was carried out in order to investigate the relationships between HPA-axis activity and in vivo immune function in depression. Towards this end the following parameters were measured: 24 h urinary cortisol (UC) excretion; basal and post-dexamethasone (DST) plasma cortisol, β-endorphin/β-lipotropin (βEND/βLPH) and dexamethasone concentrations; and leucocyte subsets (i.e. lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, CD4 + , CD4 + CD45RA + , CD4 + CD45RO + , CD8 + , CD8 + CD57 + , CD8 + CD57 − , HLA-DR + , CD25 + T cells, HLA-DR + , CD19 + , CD20 + , and CD21 + B cells) both pre-and post-DST. Dexamethasone administration (1 mg orally) induced leucocytosis, lymphocytopaenia, monocytopaenia and neutrophilia. HPA-axis non-suppressors exhibited a relative resistance to the enhancing (e.g. neutrophils) or depressant (e.g. lymphocytes, CD4 + T cells) effects of dexamethasone. There were significant correlations between UC excretion and the number of percentage of lymphocytes, monocytes, CD4 + CD45RA + and CD8 + CD57 − T cells (negatively) and neutrophils (positively). It is concluded that multiple and complex intertwined relationships between HPA-axis hyperactivity and systemic immune stimulation participate in the pathophysiology or pathogenesis of major depression.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":36},"references":73,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
