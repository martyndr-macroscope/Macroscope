The antidepressant effect of treatment ( a ) was superior to that of treatment ( b ), suggesting that the effect of light treatment in winter depression is more than that of a placebo. The antidepressant effect of treatment ( a ) was superior to that of treatment (c), although these two treatments equally suppressed plasma melatonin concentrations. Consequently, in these patients there is a dissociation between the effect of light treatment on melatonin and the reduction of depression ratings.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":40},"references":16,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
