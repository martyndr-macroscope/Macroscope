Methods This study combined the Allen Human Brain Atlas dataset with neuroimaging data from the Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium and independent cohorts. Later, partial least squares regression and enrichment analysis were performed to probe the correlation between transcription and cortical thickness variation among adults with OCD. Results The cortical map of case-control differences in cortical thickness was spatially correlated with cortical expression of a weighted combination of genes enriched for neurobiologically relevant ontology terms preferentially expressed across different cell types and cortical layers. These genes were specifically expressed in brain tissue, spanning all cortical developmental stages. Protein–protein interaction analysis revealed that these genes coded a network of proteins encompassing various highly interactive hubs. Conclusions The study findings bridge the gap between neural structure and transcriptome data in OCD, fostering an integrative understanding of the potential biological mechanisms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":77,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
