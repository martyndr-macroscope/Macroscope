To ascertain the causation, interactions reproducing the clinical phenomena have been elicited in animals with these combinations, and the mechanisms involved have been explored by various pharmacological strategies; 5-HT re-uptake inhibitors proved especially hazardous in combination. Interactions could, however, be avoided even with the 5-HT re-uptake inhibitors, by combination with relatively selective MAO A or B inhibitors, an approach with potential clinical value.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":52},"references":79,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
