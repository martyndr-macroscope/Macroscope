It is suggested that inadequate data exploration could explain some of the discrepant findings. Analyses of multi-way tables using linear–logistic models were undertaken to demonstrate patterns of association that cannot be revealed through the use of simple chi-square tests on two-way contingency tables. The variables chosen for these analyses were those that have produced conflicting findings in the literature on children's attendance at child guidance facilities.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":4},"references":18,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
