Psychosocial interventions for bipolar patients often include teaching patients to recognize prodromal symptoms and tackle them early. This prospective study set out to investigate which bipolar prodromal symptoms were reported frequently and reliably over a period of 18 months. Furthermore, we have also investigated which types of coping strategies were related to good outcome. Method . Forty bipolar patients were interviewed for their bipolar prodromal symptoms and their coping strategies at recruitment and 18 months later. Patients were also assessed as to whether they had experienced relapses. Results . Bipolar patients were able to report bipolar prodromal symptoms reliably. Mania prodromal symptoms tended to be behavioural symptoms. A quarter of patients reported difficulties in detecting depression prodromes, which tended to be more diverse and consisted of a mix of behavioural, cognitive and somatic symptoms. Significantly fewer patients who reported the use of behavioural coping strategies to curb excessive behaviour during the mania prodromal stage experienced a manic episode. Similarly, significantly fewer patients who reported the use of behavioural coping strategies experienced depression relapses. How well patients coped with mania prodromes predicted bipolar episodes significantly when the mood levels at baseline were controlled. Ratings of how well subjects coped with mania prodromal symptoms also predicted manic symptoms significantly at T2 when manic symptom at T1 was controlled. Conclusion . Our study suggests that bipolar patients are able to report prodromal symptoms reliably. It is advisable to teach patients to monitor their moods systematically and to promote good coping strategies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":126},"references":7,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
