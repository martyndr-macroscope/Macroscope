This study assessed changes in knowledge, attitude and behaviour, and stigma related to help-seeking among participants exposed to an anti-stigma campaign. Method The campaign, using multi-media interventions, was part of the SMART Mental Health Project, conducted for 3 months, across 42 villages in rural Andhra Pradesh, in South India. Mixed-methods evaluation was conducted in two villages using a pre-post design. Results A total of 1576 and 2100 participants were interviewed, at pre- and post-intervention phases of the campaign. Knowledge was not increased. Attitudes and behaviours improved significantly ( p &lt; 0.01). Stigma related to help-seeking reduced significantly ( p &lt; 0.05). Social contact and drama were the most beneficial interventions identified during qualitative interviews. Conclusion The results showed that the campaign was beneficial and led to improvement of attitude and behaviours related to mental health and reduction in stigma related to help-seeking. Social contact was the most effective intervention. The study had implications for future research in LMIC.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":96},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
