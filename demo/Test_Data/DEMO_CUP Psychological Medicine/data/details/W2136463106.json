Three distinct components were found in all the analyses, which have been called ‘clean and tidy’, ‘incompleteness’, and ‘checking’. Other less distinct components are described, and the differences and similarities between the analyses of the subgroups are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":40},"references":2,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
