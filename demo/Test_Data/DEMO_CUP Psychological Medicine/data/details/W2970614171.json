This information is essential for effective treatment planning. This study examined the effects of behavior therapy on psychiatric symptoms and functional outcomes in older adolescents and adults with TD. Method A total of 122 individuals with TD or a chronic tic disorder participated in a clinical trial comparing behavior therapy to psychoeducation and supportive therapy. At baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up visits, participants completed assessments of tic severity, co-occurring symptoms (inattention, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, anger, anxiety, depression, obsessions, and compulsions), and psychosocial functioning. We compared changes in tic severity, psychiatric symptoms, and functional outcomes using repeated measure and one-way analysis of variance. Results At posttreatment, participants receiving behavior therapy reported greater reductions in obsessions compared to participants in supportive therapy ( $\\eta _p^2 $ = 0.04, p = 0.04). Across treatments, a positive treatment response on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scale was associated with a reduced disruption in family life ( $\\eta _p^2 $ = 0.05, p = 0.02) and improved functioning in a parental role ( $\\eta _p^2 $ = 0.37, p = 0.02). Participants who responded positively to eight sessions of behavior therapy had an improvement in tic severity ( $\\eta _p^2 $ = 0.75, p &lt; 0.001), inattention ( $\\eta _p^2 $ = 0.48, p &lt; 0.02), and functioning ( $\\eta _p^2 $ = 0.39–0.42, p &lt; 0.03–0.04) at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusion Behavior therapy has a therapeutic benefit for co-occurring obsessive symptoms in the short-term, and reduces tic severity and disability in adults with TD over time. Additional treatments may be necessary to address co-occurring symptoms and improve functional outcomes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":46},"references":51,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
