In this study, pregnancy and teratogenic outcomes after exposure to tricyclic antidepressants are, for most measures, equal or worse than after exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or other antidepressants. Based on this and on a review of the few other studies available (admittedly, a relatively small number of women on which conclusions can be based), the authors of this Editorial challenge the ‘perinatal myth’ that tricyclics are the safest choice in pregnancy.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":23},"references":13,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
