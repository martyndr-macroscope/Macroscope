The Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) is a widely used measure of parenting, and is usually used to measure two parenting dimensions, care and over-protection. However, there is disagreement in the research literature about whether the PBI is best used as a two-factor or a three-factor measure. Method. PBI scores from 583 US and 236 UK students were factor analysed to assess whether a three-factor solution was more satisfactory than a two-factor solution. Results. A three-factor (care, denial of psychological autonomy and encouragement of behavioural freedom) solution was found to be more satisfactory than a two-factor solution. Using the three-factor solution, group differences that were not apparent with the two-factor solution were identified and it was found that the parenting behaviours associated with depression could be more accurately identified. Conclusion. The authors suggest that with modifications, the PBI could be used to measure three parenting variables (care, denial of psychological autonomy and encouragement of behavioural freedom), which would allow greater accuracy of prediction and a greater understanding of underlying processes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":119},"references":17,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
