Most studies use observed sum scores to document trends but fail to assess whether their measures are invariant across time, a prerequisite for meaningful inferences about change. We examined whether measurement noninvariance, indicative of changing perceptions and reporting of symptoms, may influence the assessment of time trends in adolescent depressive symptoms. Methods Data stem from the nationwide repeated cross-sectional Ungdata-surveys (2010–2019) of 560 712 responses from adolescents aged 13 to 19 years. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Kandel and Davies' six-item Depressive Mood Inventory. Using structural equation modeling, we examined measurement invariance across time, gender and age, and estimated the consequences of noninvariance on cross-cohort time trends. Results Across most conditions, the instrument was found measurement invariant across time. The few noninvariant parameters detected had negligible impact on trend estimates. From 2014, latent mean depressive symptom scores increased among girls. For boys, a U shaped pattern was detected, whereby an initial decrease in symptoms was followed by an increase from 2016. Larger issues of noninvariance were found across age in girls and between genders. Conclusions From a measurement perspective, the notion that changed reporting of symptoms has been an important driver of secular trends in depressive symptoms was not supported. Thus, other causes of these trends should be considered. However, noninvariance across age (in girls) and gender highlights that depressive symptoms are not necessarily perceived equivalently from early to late adolescence and across gender.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":66,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
