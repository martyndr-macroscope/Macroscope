A procedural training approach hypothesized the exercise of specific neural network processes, identified from theories of frontal and prefrontal lobe functioning. Three male patients who underwent the intensive program demonstrated significant gains in Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance, gains that were maintained at a six month reassessment. Expanded Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (a measure of symptomatology) and Life Skills Profile (a measure of daily functioning) measures showed smaller improvements. The ability to improve cognitive flexibility could have important implications for the treatment of schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":0,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
