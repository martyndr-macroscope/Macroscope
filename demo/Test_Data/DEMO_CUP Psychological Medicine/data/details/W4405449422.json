We compiled a book on the global reach of IPT by requesting contributions from local authors through word-of-mouth methods. This approach resulted in reports from 31 countries across six continents and 15 diverse populations within the US that spanned the age range and types of usage. In this paper, our aim was to collate and summarize book contributors' descriptions of barriers and facilitators as related to their experiences of implementing IPT across the 31 countries. We conducted a conceptual content analysis and then applied the updated Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research (CFIR) to deductively organize the barriers and facilitators into its five domains. Most found IPT to be relevant and acceptable and described minor variations needed for tailoring to context. National level policies and mental health stigma were highlighted in the outer setting. Availability of specialists and general and mental health infrastructure were considerations relevant to the inner setting. Many sites had successfully implemented IPT through delivery by nonspecialized providers, although provider workload and burnout were common. Clients faced numerous practical challenges in accessing weekly care. Primary strategies to mitigate these challenges were use of telehealth delivery and shortening of the intervention duration. Most programs ensured competency through a combination of didactic training and case supervision. The latter was identified as time-intensive and costly.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":60,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
