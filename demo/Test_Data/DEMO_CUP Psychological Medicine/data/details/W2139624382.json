A cluster analysis technique is described for determining whether the pattern of behavioural items in 3 year olds could be used as a basis for such a classification. Among the clusters found were two suggesting conduct and neurotic disorders. Two pieces of evidence suggest that the clusters produced are clinically meaningful and have prognostic significance: (1) a group of children with a high risk for later psychiatrie disorder (children in local authority care) are over-represented in the ‘pathological’ clusters, and (2) the mothers of the children in these latter ‘clusters’ have significantly higher scores than mothers of children in the remaining clusters on an index of mental health one year later. It is suggested that evidence for the psychiatrie syndromes of early life is sufficiently strong to warrant further investigation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":18},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
