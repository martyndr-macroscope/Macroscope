This study aimed to broaden the scope of outcome indicators by examining the relationships between 12 outcomes of FEP patients at 20.9 years after their initial diagnosis. Methods At follow-up, 220 out of 550 original patients underwent a new assessment. Twelve outcomes were assessed via semistructured interviews and complementary scales: symptom severity, functional impairment, personal recovery, social disadvantage, physical health, number of suicide attempts, number of episodes, current drug use, dose-years of antipsychotics (DYAps), cognitive impairment, motor abnormalities, and DSM-5 final diagnosis. The relationships between these outcome measures were investigated using Spearman’s correlation analysis and exploratory factor analysis, while the specific connections between outcomes were ascertained using network analysis. Results The outcomes were significantly correlated; specifically, symptom severity, functioning, and personal recovery showed the strongest correlations. Exploratory factor analysis of the 12 outcomes revealed two factors, with 11 of the 12 outcomes loading on the first factor. Network analysis revealed that symptom severity, functioning, social disadvantage, diagnosis, cognitive impairment, DYAps, and number of episodes were the most interconnected outcomes. Conclusion Network analysis provided new insights into the heterogeneity between outcomes among patients with FEP. By considering outcomes beyond symptom severity, the rich net of interconnections elucidated herein can facilitate the development of interventions that target potentially modifiable outcomes and generalize their impact on the most interconnected outcomes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":2},"references":115,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
