A second group of symptoms which included formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect was associated with poor performance in tests of concentration, immediate recall and word learning, and with cortical neurological signs. The findings suggest that these two syndromes are associated with dysfunction at two different sites within the frontal lobes. A third group of symptoms, comprising various delusions and hallucinations, was associated with poor figure-ground perception, and might reflect temporal lobe dysfunction.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":24,"cited_by_count":549},"references":35,"networkCitations":24,"seed":false}
