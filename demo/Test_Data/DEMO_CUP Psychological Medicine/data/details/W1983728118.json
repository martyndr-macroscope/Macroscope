This finding also obtained if only those subjects ignorant of their own blood pressure level were considered for the same comparison. As a result of administration of a standardized psychiatric interview and a hostility questionnaire to 108 hypertensive and normotensive subjects of a special study, differences in the expression of hostility were demonstrated between the 2 groups. Subjects with hypertension appear to demonstrate more hostility and be less self-critical than a normotensive group. This finding could reflect the effect of recent diagnosis and treatment of hypertension or be associated with the hypertensive state itself.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":37},"references":21,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
