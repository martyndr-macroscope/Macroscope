However, it is unclear whether these abnormalities also occur in individuals at clinically high risk for psychosis (CHR). The current study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to address this question and examined the nature of abnormalities at three stages of emotion regulation (identification, selection, implementation). Methods Participants included 120 CHR and 59 CN who completed 1 week of EMA surveys evaluating emotional experience, emotion regulation, context, and symptoms. Multi-level models examined concurrent and time-lagged effects. Results CHR evidenced elevated state negative affect and abnormalities at all three stages of emotion regulation. At the identification stage (i.e., determining the need to regulate), regulatory attempts were made too frequently and with too much effort at low levels of negative affect and not frequently enough and with insufficient effort at high levels of negative affect. Selection stage abnormalities (i.e., choosing the exact strategy to attempt based on context) were characterized by increased frequency of selecting individual strategies and greater polyregulation (i.e., use of multiple strategies concurrently). Implementation stage (i.e., executing the selected strategy) abnormalities were indicated by being less effective at decreasing the intensity of negative affect from time t to t + 1. Conclusions It is not only heightened stress reactivity that confers risk for psychosis, but also abnormalities in applying emotion regulation strategies to control the stress response. The profile of abnormalities observed in CHR is similar to schizophrenia, suggesting treatment targets that transcend phases of psychotic illness.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":45,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
