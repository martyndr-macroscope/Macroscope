They reported thoughts primarily or solely in the form of images. By contrast, normal adults previously tested with this technique reported inner experiences of a variety of forms. The present report suggests the feasibility and potential interest of the experience sampling method with high-functioning individuals with autistic disorder.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":209},"references":32,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
