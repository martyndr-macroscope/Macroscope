This study aimed to investigate the long-term associations between polygenic risk scores for neuroticism (PRS N ), objective childhood adversity and their interplay on emotional health aspects such as neuroticism itself, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, loneliness and life satisfaction. Methods The sample consisted of reared-apart (TRA) and reared-together (TRT) middle- and old age twins ( N = 699; median age at separation = 2). PRS N were created under nine p value cut-off thresholds ( p T -s) and the p T with the highest degree of neuroticism variance explained was chosen for subsequent analyses. Linear regressions were used to assess the associations between PRS N , childhood adversity (being reared apart) and emotional health. G × E was further investigated using a discordant twin design. Results PRS N explained up to 1.7% ( p T &lt; 0.01) of phenotypic neuroticism in the total sample. Analyses across two separation groups revealed substantial heterogeneity in the variance explained by PRS N ; 4.3% was explained in TRT, but almost no effect was observed in TRA. Similarly, PRS N explained 4% and 1.7% of the variance in depressive symptoms and loneliness, respectively, only in TRT. A significant G × E interaction was identified for depressive symptoms. Conclusions By taking advantage of a unique sample of adopted twins, we demonstrated the presence of G × E in neuroticism and emotional health using PRS N and childhood adversity. Our results may indicate that genome-wide association studies are detecting genetic main effects associated with neuroticism, but not those susceptible to early environmental influences.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":14},"references":68,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
