However, the clinical interview is not a defined entity in the way that ‘vitals’ are defined as measurements of blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. There are as many ways to approach a clinical interview as there are psychiatrists; and trainees can learn as many ways of performing and formulating the clinical interview as there are instructors (Nestler, 1990). Even in the same clinical setting, two clinicians might interview the same patient and conduct very different examinations and reach different treatment recommendations. From the perspective of data science, this mismatch is not one of personal style or idiosyncrasy but rather one of uncertain salience: neither the clinical interview nor the data thereby generated is operationalized and, therefore, neither can be rigorously evaluated, tested, or optimized.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":9,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
