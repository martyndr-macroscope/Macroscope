Two shorter versions are proposed: one with 6 scales and 30 items, and the other with 4 scales and 28 items. The latter is compared with the 28-item English version. Preliminary data concerning the validity of the scales are presented. In a comparison of the screening potentiality of the 60- and 28-item versions, no significant differences were found.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":75},"references":12,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
