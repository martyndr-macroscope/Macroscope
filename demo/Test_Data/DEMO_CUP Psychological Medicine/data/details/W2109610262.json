As expected, an association was found between symptoms and life events reported as occurring in the previous 4 months. A path analysis model was then constructed. The association between symptoms and events of the previous 4 months remained, but in neither panel did events reported as occurring more than 4 months previously predict symptoms.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":46},"references":21,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
