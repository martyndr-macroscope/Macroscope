Clinical judgments were used to distinguish therapeutic responders from non-responders, who showed clear differences in depressive rating scales and body weight changes. Measurements of urinary output of DMI, of salivation, and of the incidence of side-effects were compared in responders and non-responders: no differences appeared between the two groups. It is concluded that the therapeutic effect of imipramine does not depend on either its anticholinergic or other action revealed by the common side-effects, and that variability of response cannot be accounted for by differences in the rate of metabolism of DMI.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":31},"references":27,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
