This study reports long-term dosage effects at 18 and 24 months. Methods In a pragmatic, double-randomized clinical trial, 246 outpatients with depression and PD were assigned to (1) 25 or 50 sessions and (2) Short-term Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy (SPSP) or Schema Therapy (ST). Depression severity was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Secondary outcomes included diagnostic remission of depression (MINI-plus), PD (SCID-II/SCID-5-P), and treatment-specific measures. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Results At 18 and 24 months, BDI-II means did not differ between dosage groups (19.0 for 25 sessions versus 19.1 for 50 sessions; d = −0.01; 95% CI = −0.35-0.37, p = 0.96). The lower-dosage group improved during follow-up (−2.6 BDI points, p = 0.031), which may be partly attributed to additional therapy received by a subgroup. Remission rates at 24 months were 66% for depression and 76% for PD, with no differences between conditions. Conclusions Higher psychotherapy dosage led to faster initial improvements, but long-term outcomes were not superior to those achieved with a lower dosage. These results should be interpreted with caution, as unregulated treatment during follow-up reduced the power to detect significant dosage effects. Both SPSP and ST provide viable alternatives to treatments focused solely on depression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":1},"references":28,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
