Computer analysis by means of the Catego program showed that 30% of the patients had insufficient symptoms to be considered as psychiatric ‘cases’. Fewer than 4% had symptoms of functional psychosis. About 60% of the patients were classed as depressed: on several indices this group was less severely ill than a group of depressives receiving psychiatric treatment. It is suggested that psychiatric treatment is essential for only a small proportion of self-poisoning patients. The effectiveness of psychiatric treatment for the large group of patients with depressive disorders of minor severity and probably short duration has still to be evaluated.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":76},"references":16,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
