Therefore, this study focused on analyzing SSD and four types of FSS (fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia). Methods This population-based matched cohort study utilized Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) claims database to investigate the impact of SSD/FSS. The study included 2 615 477 newly diagnosed patients with SSD/FSS and matched comparisons from the NHI beneficiary registry. Healthcare utilization, mortality, medical expenditure, and medication usage were assessed as outcome measures. Statistical analysis involved Cox regression models for hazard ratios, generalized linear models for comparing differences, and adjustment for covariates. Results All SSD/FSS showed significantly higher adjusted hazard ratios for psychiatric hospitalization and all-cause hospitalization compared to the control group. All SSD/FSS exhibited significantly higher adjusted hazard ratios for suicide, and SSD was particularly high. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in all SSD/FSS. Medical costs were significantly higher for all SSD/FSS compared to controls. The usage duration of all psychiatric medications and analgesics was significantly higher in SSD/FSS compared to the control group. Conclusion All SSD/FSS shared similar clinical outcomes and medical costs. The high hazard ratio for suicide in SSD deserves clinical attention.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":9},"references":30,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
