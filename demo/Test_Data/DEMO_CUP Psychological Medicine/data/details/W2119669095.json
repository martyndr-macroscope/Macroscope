Factor analysis of the psychopathological features of 166 consecutively admitted patients with functional psychosis of recent onset revealed seven psychopathological dimensions, which explained 63% of the variance. Five of these seven syndromes bore differential associations with subsequent treatment and illness course, independent of: ( i ) associations with DSM-III-R diagnosis; ( ii ) associations with other prognostic factors; and ( iii ) associations with the baseline values of outcome variables. The most striking associations were shown for an early and insidious onset syndrome with affective flattening, which predicted a more disabled course of illness on three of four outcome dimensions, and which was more common in males and unmarried individuals. A second syndrome, characterized by bizarre behaviour, inappropriate affect, catatonia, and poor rapport showed similar, slightly less striking, associations with illness course, as well as with poor pre-morbid social functioning. A third syndrome, characterized by positive psychotic symptoms was to a lesser degree associated with poorer outcome, whereas a fourth syndrome distinguished by manic symptomatology predicted a more benign illness course. A fifth syndrome identified by lack of insight predicted more time in hospital and admission under a section of the Mental Health Act during the follow-up period. A further finding was that dimensional representations of psychopathological features were considerably more useful than categorical representations (DSM-III-R and ICD-10) as predictors of illness course and treatment decisions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":198},"references":61,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
