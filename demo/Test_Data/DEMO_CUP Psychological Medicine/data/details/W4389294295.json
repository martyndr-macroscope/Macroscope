Methods Participants came from the population-based Young Finns Study ( n = 2377). We calculated a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS SCZ ) and for major depression (PRS DEP ). Diagnoses of psychotic disorders were derived from the hospital care register. Social development from adolescence to middle age was measured by (a) perceived social support from friends, family, and a close other, (b) perceived sociability, and (c) family structure (partnership status, number of children, age of first-time parenthood). Results Among those without manifest psychoses, high PRS SCZ predicted lower experienced support from friends ( B = −0.04, p = 0.009–0.035) and family ( B = −0.04, p = 0.009–0.035) especially after early adulthood, and also lower perceived sociability ( B = −0.05, p = 0.010–0.026). PRS SCZ was not related to family structure. PRS DEP did not predict any domain of social development. Conclusions Individuals at high PRS SCZ (not converted to psychosis) seem to experience a lower preference to be with others over being alone. Individuals with high ( v. low) PRS SCZ seem to have a similar family structure in terms of partnership status or number of children but, nevertheless, they experience less support from their family. Among those not converted to psychosis in a typical age period, high PRS SCZ may predict a ‘later risk phase’ and reduced functional resilience when approaching middle age.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":6},"references":45,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
