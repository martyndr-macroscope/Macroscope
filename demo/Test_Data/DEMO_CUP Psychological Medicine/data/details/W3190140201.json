However, little is known about the gene−environment (G × E) mechanisms underlying their aetiology. For the first time, we tested the independent and interactive associations of ACEs and polygenic scores of major depressive disorder (MDD-PGS) and C-reactive protein (CRP-PGS) with longitudinal trajectories of depression and chronic inflammation in older adults. Methods Data were drawn from the English longitudinal study of ageing ( N ~3400). Retrospective information on ACEs was collected in wave3 (2006/07). We calculated a cumulative risk score of ACEs and also assessed distinct dimensions separately. Depressive symptoms were ascertained on eight occasions, from wave1 (2002/03) to wave8 (2016/17). CRP was measured in wave2 (2004/05), wave4 (2008/09), and wave6 (2012/13). The associations of the risk factors with group-based depressive-symptom trajectories and repeated exposure to high CRP (i.e. ⩾3 mg/L) were tested using multinomial and ordinal logistic regression. Results All types of ACEs were independently associated with high depressive-symptom trajectories (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.30–1.60) and inflammation (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07–1.09). The risk of high depressive-symptom trajectories (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.28–1.70) and inflammation (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.04) was also higher for participants with higher MDD-PGS. G×E analyses revealed that the associations between ACEs and depressive symptoms were larger among participants with higher MDD-PGS (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04–1.23). ACEs were also more strongly related to inflammation in participants with higher CRP-PGS (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.03). Conclusions ACEs and polygenic susceptibility were independently and interactively associated with elevated depressive symptoms and chronic inflammation, highlighting the clinical importance of assessing both ACEs and genetic risk factors to design more targeted interventions.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":18},"references":63,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
