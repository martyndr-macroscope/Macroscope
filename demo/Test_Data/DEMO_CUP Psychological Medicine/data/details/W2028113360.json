Findings showed dependence on a restricted number of family members and close friends, with high levels of expressive support (for example, 71 per cent of the sample reported that someone had ‘let you know that he or she is always around if you need help with something’). Follow-up interviews were obtained on two further occasions over a period of one year, and significant changes in network structure and support mobilization were found. A decrease in non-family network size suggested greater reliance on close family and friends and a withdrawal from weaker ties with members of the community. Finally, the findings of this study emphasize the importance of incorporating a time dimension into research on the mobilization of support following a stressful life event such as job loss.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":43},"references":32,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
