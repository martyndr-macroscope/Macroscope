Here, we aim to investigate the common and/or unique dynamic structure–function coupling patterns across major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ). Methods We quantified the dynamic structure–function coupling in 452 patients with psychiatric disorders (MDD/BD/SZ = 166/168/118) and 205 unaffected controls at three distinct brain network levels, such as global, meso-, and local levels. We also correlated dynamic structure–function coupling with the topological features of functional networks to examine how the structure–function relationship facilitates brain information communication over time. Results The dynamic structure–function coupling is preserved for the three disorders at the global network level. Similar abnormalities in the rich-club organization are found in two distinct functional configuration states at the meso-level and are associated with the disease severity of MDD, BD, and SZ. At the local level, shared and unique alterations are observed in the brain regions involving the visual, cognitive control, and default mode networks. In addition, the relationships between structure–function coupling and the topological features of functional networks are altered in a manner indicative of state specificity. Conclusions These findings suggest both transdiagnostic and illness-specific alterations in the dynamic structure–function relationship of large-scale brain networks across MDD, BD, and SZ, providing new insights and potential biomarkers into the neurodevelopmental basis underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits observed in these disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":8},"references":89,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
