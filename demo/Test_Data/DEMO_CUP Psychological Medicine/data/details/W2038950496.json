There were three cases of syphilis, two cases of sarcoidosis, three of alcohol excess and two of drug abuse. There was one case each of carcinoma of the lung, autoimmune multisystem disease, cerebral cysticercosis, thyroid disease and previous head injury. In this series, identified organic disease was associated with less than 6% of cases of schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":110},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
