These tasks were administered to long-hospitalized schizophrenics. No evidence of a differential deficit, that is, better recall of either the verbal or the visuospatial materials, emerged in the patients. The results replicate a former finding showing no difference between verbal and visuospatial recall in schizophrenics, using memory tasks which were less sensitive as left- and right-hemisphere measures and a non-verbal task less affected by verbal mediation. This replication questions the assumption that the hemispheric differences observed in schizophrenics affect such memory tasks.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":17},"references":43,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
