This re-test artefact is a potential threat to the validity of longitudinal studies. Data from a longitudinal general population study were analysed to discover under what circumstances the re-test artefact occurs. It was found that the artefact is unrelated to the time lag between occasions, being equally strong at intervals ranging from 4 to 34 weeks. However, the artefact did not occur for all measures, but was confined to those assessing negative self-characteristics and administered orally by an interviewer. These findings are consistent with both the ‘mechanical responding’ and ‘social desirability’ hypotheses of the re-test artefact.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":99},"references":16,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
