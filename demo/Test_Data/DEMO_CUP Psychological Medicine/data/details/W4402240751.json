This study therefore aimed to (1) discriminate between different facets of social relationships by means of factor analysis, (2) examine their associations with dementia risk, and (3) assess mediation by depressive symptoms. Methods Thirty-six items from questionnaires on social relationships administered in Wave 2 (2004/2005) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing ( n = 7536) were used for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Factors were then used as predictors in Cox proportional hazard models with dementia until Wave 9 as outcome, adjusted for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors. Structural equation modeling tested mediation by depressive symptoms through effect decomposition. Results Factor analyses identified six social factors. Across a median follow-up time of 11.8 years (IQR = 5.9–13.9 years), 501 people developed dementia. Higher factor scores for frequency and quality of contact with children (HR = 0.88; p = 0.021) and more frequent social activity engagement (HR = 0.84; p &lt; 0.001) were associated with lower dementia risk. Likewise, higher factor scores for loneliness (HR = 1.13; p = 0.011) and negative experiences of social support (HR = 1.10; p = 0.047) were associated with higher dementia risk. Mediation analyses showed a significant partial effect mediation by depressive symptoms for all four factors. Additional analyses provided little evidence for reverse causation. Conclusions Frequency and quality of social contacts, social activity engagement, and feelings of loneliness are associated with dementia risk and might be suitable targets for dementia prevention programs, partly by lowering depressive symptoms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":54,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
