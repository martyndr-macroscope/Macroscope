Antibodies to oats, wheat, gluten, chicken, calf and milk protein were measured in 98 schizophrenics and in 90 unaffected close blood relatives. The majority of patients were male out-patients, and most were on neuroleptic medication. Antibodies were detected in only a minority of patients.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":15},"references":28,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
