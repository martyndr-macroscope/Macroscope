While BED may be characterized by altered cortical morphometry, no evidence to date examined possible sex-differences in regional gray matter characteristics among those with BED. This is especially important to consider in children, where BED symptoms often emerge coincident with rapid gray matter maturation. Methods Pre-adolescent, 9–10-year old boys ( N = 38) and girls ( N = 33) with BED were extracted from the 3.0 baseline (Year 0) release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. We investigated sex differences in gray matter density (GMD) via voxel-based morphometry. Control sex differences were also assessed in age and body mass index and developmentally matched control children (boys N = 36; girls N = 38). Among children with BED, we additionally assessed the association between dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) GMD and parent-reported behavioral approach and inhibition tendencies. Results Girls with BED uniquely demonstrate diffuse clusters of greater GMD ( p &lt; 0.05, Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement corrected) in the (i) left dlPFC ( p = 0.003), (ii) bilateral dmPFC ( p = 0.004), (iii) bilateral primary motor and somatosensory cortex ( p = 0.0003) and (iv) bilateral precuneus ( p = 0.007). Brain-behavioral associations suggest a unique negative correlation between GMD in the left dlPFC and behavioral approach tendencies among girls with BED. Conclusions Early-onset BED may be characterized by regional sex differences in terms of its underlying gray matter morphometry.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":9},"references":81,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
