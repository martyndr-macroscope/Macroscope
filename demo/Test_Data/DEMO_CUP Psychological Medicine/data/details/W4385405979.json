We examined group differences in performance on a ToM-related test and associations with an estimated IQ. Methods Participants [ N = 1227, SZ ( n = 563), ASD ( n = 159), and controls ( n = 505), 32.2% female] completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and assessments of cognitive ability. Associations between IQ and group on RMET were investigated with regression analyses. Results SZ ( d = 0.73, p &lt; 0.001) and ASD ( d = 0.37, p &lt; 0.001) performed significantly worse on the RMET than controls. SZ performed significantly worse than ASD ( d = 0.32, p = 0.002). Adding IQ to the model, SZ ( d = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001) and ASD ( d = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001) continued to perform significantly worse than controls, but no longer differed from each other ( d = 0.13, p = 0.30). Small significant negative correlations between symptom severity and RMET performance were found in SZ (PANSS positive: r = −0.10, negative: r = −0.11, both p &lt; 0.05). A small non-significant negative correlation was found for Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule scores and RMET in ASD ( r = −0.08, p = 0.34). Conclusions SZ and ASD are characterized by impairments in RMET. IQ contributed significantly to RMET performance and accounted for group differences in RMET between SZ and ASD. This suggests that non-social cognitive ability needs to be included in comparative studies of the two disorders.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":8},"references":50,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
