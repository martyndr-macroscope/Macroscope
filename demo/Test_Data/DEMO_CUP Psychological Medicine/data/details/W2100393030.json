There was no significant overall change in cognitive function in this patient group as a whole, suggesting the absence of active disease at this stage of the illness. The only correlate of individual instances of cognitive deterioration over the study period was the emergence of new cases of tardive buccal-lingual-masticatory but not of limb-trunkal dyskinesia, and the greater severity of such movement disorder. A positive family history was also identified prospectively as a predictor of the emergence of tardive dyskinesia in chronic schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":61},"references":32,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
