In this study, the structural connectivity between symptoms of MDD is explored using two different network modeling approaches. Methods Data are from ‘the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders (VATSPSUD)’. A cohort of N = 2163 American Caucasian female-female twins was assessed as part of the VATSPSUD study. MDD symptoms were assessed using personal structured clinical interviews. Two network analyses were conducted. First, an undirected network model was estimated to explore the connectivity between the MDD symptoms. Then, using a Bayesian network, we computed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to investigate possible directional relationships between symptoms. Results Based on the results of the undirected network, the depressed mood symptom had the highest centrality value, indicating its importance in the overall network of MDD symptoms. Bayesian network analysis indicated that depressed mood emerged as a plausible driving symptom for activating other symptoms. These results are consistent with DSM-5 guidelines for MDD. Also, somatic weight and appetite symptoms appeared as the strongest connections in both networks. Conclusions We discuss how the findings of our study might help future research to detect clinically relevant symptoms and possible directional relationships between MDD symptoms defining major depression episodes, which would help identify potential tailored interventions. This is the first study to investigate the network structure of VATSPSUD data using both undirected and directed network models.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":11},"references":49,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
