Methods Using the Medical Research Council framework, in the first stage (modelling/theoretical development), experts reviewed and distilled evidence from literature to form the intervention components. In the second (formative) stage, local stakeholders were consulted on the practical application and feasibility of the proposed intervention. The third (piloting) stage involved testing for the clinical efficacy and acceptability of the components of the draft intervention Results The final intervention components included a 2-stage screening (red-flagging and further evaluation), psychoeducation, low-intensity psychological therapy (problem-solving therapy for primary care), antidepressant prescription, proactive mobile telephony adherence support and referral to the mental health specialist if needed. At 3 months, 71.6% of depressed patients on the intervention improved. The intervention was perceived to be acceptable and useful by over 70% of health workers and clients and had high ratings (&gt;70% score) by expert panels on intervention simplicity, facilitation strategies, and quality of delivery. Conclusions The development and feasibility testing of our integrated intervention encompassed review of current literature, expert opinions and consultation with local stakeholders and end users. Our intervention package was largely deemed acceptable, relevant, useful, and feasible. Important lessons learnt with this process will help in future intervention developments.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":14},"references":27,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
