However, previous studies demonstrating diminished perceptual modulation via attention are complicated by simultaneously impaired perceptual responses. The present study examined the early auditory gamma-band response (EAGBR), a marker of early cortical processing that appears preserved in first-episode psychosis (FEP), and its modulation by attention in a longitudinal FEP sample. Methods Magnetoencephalography was recorded from 25 FEP and 32 healthy controls (HC) during active and passive listening conditions in an auditory oddball task at baseline and follow-up (4–12 months) sessions. EAGBR inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and evoked power were measured from responses to standard tones. Symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results There was no group difference in EAGBR power or ITPC. While EAGBR ITPC increased with attention in HC, this modulation was impaired among FEP. Diminished EAGBR modulation in FEP persisted at longitudinal follow-up. However, among FEP, recovery of EAGBR modulation was associated with reduced PANSS negative scores. Conclusion FEP exhibit impaired executive control over the flow of information at the earliest stages of sensory processing within auditory cortex. In contrast to previous work, this deficit was observed despite an intact measure of sensory processing, mitigating potential confounds. Recovery of sensory gain modulation over time was associated with reductions in negative symptoms, highlighting a source of potential resiliency against some of the most debilitating and treatment refractory symptoms in early psychosis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":34,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
