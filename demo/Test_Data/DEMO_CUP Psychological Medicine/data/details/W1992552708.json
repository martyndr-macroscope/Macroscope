Recent studies suggest that future patients with other mental illnesses obtain lower pre-morbid IQ. The aims of this study were to compare pre-morbid IQ among five diagnostic categories and normal controls, to examine the distribution of pre-morbid IQ, and to investigate the relationship between pre-morbid IQ and risk of mental illness. Method A total of 7486 individuals hospitalized with psychiatric disease and 20 531 controls. IQ was measured at the draft board and hospital diagnoses [schizophrenia (Sz), non-schizophrenic, non-affective psychoses (NSAP), affective (AD), personality (PD) and neurotic/stress disorders (ND)] were followed up to ages 43–54 years. Individuals hospitalized ⩽1 year after appearing before the draft board were excluded. Results All future patients obtained significantly lower pre-morbid IQ than controls (3–7 IQ points), AD had the highest IQ and PD the lowest. In each diagnostic category, decreasing IQ was associated with an increasing risk of becoming a patient [odds ratios (ORs) 0.5–2.5 over the full IQ spectrum]. IQ distributions was nearly normal and uni-modal. Conclusions IQ deficits in each diagnostic category may reflect different functional patterns and temporal vicissitudes of the specific pathogenetic processes involved in different mental disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":70},"references":49,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
