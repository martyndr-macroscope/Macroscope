There are currently no support or effective intervention therapeutics for individuals with an ED in their everyday life. The aim of this study is to build idiographic machine learning (ML) models to evaluate the performance of physiological recordings to detect individual ED behaviors in naturalistic settings. Methods From an ongoing study (Final N = 120), we piloted the ability for ML to detect an individual's ED behavioral episodes (e.g. purging) from physiological data in six individuals diagnosed with an ED, all of whom endorsed purging. Participants wore an ambulatory monitor for 30 days and tapped a button to denote ED behavioral episodes. We built idiographic ( N = 1) logistic regression classifiers (LRC) ML trained models to identify onset of episodes (~600 windows) v. baseline (~571 windows) physiology (Heart Rate, Electrodermal Activity, and Temperature). Results Using physiological data, ML LRC accurately classified on average 91% of cases, with 92% specificity and 90% sensitivity. Conclusions This evidence suggests the ability to build idiographic ML models that detect ED behaviors from physiological indices within everyday life with a high level of accuracy. The novel use of ML with wearable sensors to detect physiological patterns of ED behavior pre-onset can lead to just-in-time clinical interventions to disrupt problematic behaviors and promote ED recovery.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":16},"references":56,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
