On one occasion it was administered in its original card-sorting (postbox) form; on the other, it was given as a written questionnaire. Fifty students answered the postbox form first, 50 the questionnaire first. Correlation between the 2 tests was reasonably good ( r = 0·73–0·77). Scores on the first occasion of testing were significantly higher than on the second, but differences between scores on the 2 forms were not significant. Mean scores of male and female students were similar.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":63},"references":10,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
