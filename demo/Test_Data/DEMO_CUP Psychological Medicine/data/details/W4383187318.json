This study identifies differences in the clinically observable phenome across a wide variety of physical and mental disorders comparing patients with diagnoses of depression without anxiety, anxiety without depression, or both depression and anxiety. Methods Using electronic health records for 14 994 participants with depression and/or anxiety in the Mayo Clinic Biobank, a phenotype-based phenome-wide association study (Phe 2 WAS) was performed to test for differences between these groups across a broad range of clinical diagnoses observed in the electronic health record. Additional analyses were performed to determine the temporal sequencing of diagnoses. Results Compared to patients diagnosed only with anxiety, those diagnosed only with depression were more likely to have diagnoses of obesity (OR 1.75; p = 1 × 10 −27 ), sleep apnea (OR 1.71; p = 1 × 10 −22 ), and type II diabetes (OR 1.74; p = 9 × 10 −18 ). Compared to those diagnosed only with depression, those diagnosed only with anxiety were more likely to have diagnoses of palpitations (OR 1.91; p = 2 × 10 −25 ), benign skin neoplasms (OR 1.61; p = 2 × 10 −17 ), and cardiac dysrhythmias (OR 1.45; p = 2 × 10 −12 ). Patients with comorbid depression and anxiety were more likely to have diagnoses of other mental health disorders, substance use disorders, sleep problems, and gastroesophageal reflux relative to isolated depression. Conclusions While depression and anxiety are closely related, this study suggests that phenotypic distinctions exist between depression and anxiety. Improving phenotypic characterization within the broad categories of depression and anxiety could improve the clinical assessment of depression and anxiety.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":8},"references":57,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
