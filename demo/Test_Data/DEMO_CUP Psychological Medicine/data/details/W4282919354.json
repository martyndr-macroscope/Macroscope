Study objectives were (i) test the intervention's feasibility, (ii) provide effect size estimates, (iii) assess dose–response and (iv) select primary outcomes for future trials. Methods In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, sixty-three outpatients with clinically significant paranoia were randomised to either CBM-pa or an active control (text reading) between April 2016 and September 2017. Patients received one 40 min session per week for 6 weeks. Assessments were given at baseline, after each interim session, post-treatment, and at 1- and 3-months post-treatment. Results A total of 122 patients were screened and 63 were randomised. The recruitment rate was 51.2%, with few dropouts (four out of 63) and follow-up rates were 90.5% (1-month) and 93.7% (3-months). Each session took 30–40 min to complete. There was no statistical evidence of harmful effects of the intervention. Preliminary data were consistent with efficacy of CBM-pa over text-reading control: patients randomised to the intervention, compared to control patients, reported reduced interpretation bias ( d = −0.48 to −0.76), improved symptoms of paranoia ( d = −0.19 to −0.38), and lower depressed and anxious mood ( d = −0.03 to −0.29). The intervention effect was evident after the third session. Conclusions CBM-pa is feasible for patients with paranoia. A fully powered randomised control trial is warranted.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":24},"references":52,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
