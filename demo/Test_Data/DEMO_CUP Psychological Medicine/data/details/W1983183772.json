Failure to respond occurred in long-lasting depressions and in patients with a history of long-lasting depressions. In these cases the depression lasted at least 6 months. The hypothesis is proposed that ECT is effective only when given within 6 months of the spontaneous end of the depression. Clinical and nosological implications are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":42},"references":13,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
