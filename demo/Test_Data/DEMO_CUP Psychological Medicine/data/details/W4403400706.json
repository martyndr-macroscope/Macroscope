Our study aimed to assess the association between negative wealth shocks and depression and its trajectories, and to explore cross-national differences in these associations Methods Our sample included 21 999 participants, of which 9519 were from the Health and Retirement Study (2012–2020), 4936 from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2012–2020), 2520 from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (2011–2020), and 5024 from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (2012–2021). We used latent class trajectory models to identify depressive trajectories, alongside mixed-model logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression to evaluate associations. Results In the USA (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.40–2.16), England (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.09–2.70), and China (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09–1.75), negative wealth shocks were associated with subsequent depressive symptoms, but not in Mexico (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.86–1.29). Additionally, negative wealth shocks were associated with several depressive trajectories in the USA and China. This association occurred only in increasing–decreasing trajectory in England, while no significant association was found across any trajectory in Mexico. Conclusions Negative wealth shocks were associated with subsequent depressive symptoms, with significant associations observed in some specific depressive trajectories. These associations exhibited cross-national differences, underscoring the importance of considering country-specific contexts when addressing the mental health impacts of wealth shocks.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":37,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
