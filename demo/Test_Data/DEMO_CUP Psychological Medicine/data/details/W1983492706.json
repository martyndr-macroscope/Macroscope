Type A individuals may be unwilling or unable to accurately self-report. The female spouse of the male patient can potentially provide a more objective, accurate ‘trait’ description less contaminated by ‘state’ variables such as diagnosis of illness or medication. The development of a spouse-report questionnaire is described and pilot data from 41 couples are presented, including comparison of the self-report and spouse-report responses on 46 questionnaire items and five scales. Unexpectedly high levels of agreement were found between self and spouse reports. Possible explanations of such agreement are critically examined.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":8},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
