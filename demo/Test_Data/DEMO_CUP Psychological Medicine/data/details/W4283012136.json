However, most research has focused on the sum scores of symptoms. Relatively little is known about how individual symptoms respond. Methods Longitudinal models were used to explore how depression and generalised anxiety symptoms behave over the course of CBT in a retrospective, observational cohort of patients from primary care settings ( n = 5306). Logistic mixed models were used to examine the probability of being symptom-free across CBT appointments, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale as measures. Results All symptoms improve across CBT treatment. The results suggest that low mood/hopelessness and guilt/worthlessness improved quickest relative to other depressive symptoms, with sleeping problems, appetite changes, and psychomotor retardation/agitation improving relatively slower. Uncontrollable worry and too much worry were the anxiety symptoms that improved fastest; irritability and restlessness improved the slowest. Conclusions This research suggests there is a benefit to examining symptoms rather than sum scores alone. Investigations of symptoms provide the potential for precision psychiatry and may explain some of the heterogeneity observed in clinical outcomes when only sum scores are considered.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":5},"references":45,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
