While most prior research has focused on single pairs of mental disorders and physical-health conditions, this study explores broader associations between multiple mental disorders and physical-health conditions. Methods Using the Norwegian primary-care register, this population-based cohort study encompassed all 2 203 553 patients born in Norway from January 1945 through December 1984, who were full-time residents from January 2006 until December 2019 (14 years; 363 million person-months). Associations between seven mental disorders (sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, acute stress reaction, substance-use disorders, phobia/compulsive disorder, psychosis) and 16 physical-health conditions were examined, diagnosed according to the International Classification of Primary Care. Results Of 112 mental-disorder/physical-health condition pairs, 96% of associations yielded positive and significant ORs, averaging 1.41 and ranging from 1.05 (99.99% CI 1.00–1.09) to 2.38 (99.99% CI 2.30–2.46). Across 14 years, every mental disorder was associated with multiple different physical-health conditions. Across 363 million person-months, having any mental disorder was associated with increased subsequent risk of all physical-health conditions (HRs:1.40 [99.99% CI 1.35–1.45] to 2.85 [99.99% CI 2.81–2.89]) and vice versa (HRs:1.56 [99.99% CI 1.54–1.59] to 3.56 [99.99% CI 3.54–3.58]). Associations were observed in both sexes, across age groups, and among patients with and without university education. Conclusions The breadth of associations between virtually every mental disorder and physical-health condition among patients treated in primary care underscores a need for integrated mental and physical healthcare policy and practice. This remarkable breadth also calls for research into etiological factors and underlying mechanisms that can explain it.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":73,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
