Although gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) differences in LLD have been reported, few studies have investigated them concurrently. Moreover, the impact of aetiological factors, such as neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular burden, on tissue differences remains elusive. Methods This prospective cross-sectional study involved 72 participants, including 33 patients with LLD (mean age 72.2 years, 23 female) and 39 healthy controls (HCs) (mean age 70.6 years, 24 female), who underwent clinical and positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments. High-resolution 3D T1-weighted and T2-weighted FLAIR images were used to assess MTL GM volumes and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), a proxy for cerebrovascular burden. Diffusion kurtosis imaging metrics derived from multishell diffusion MRI data were analyzed to assess WM microstructure in the following MTL bundles reconstructed using constrained spherical deconvolution tractography: uncinate fasciculus, fornix, and cingulum. Standardized uptake value ratio of 18F-MK-6240 in the MTL was used to assess Alzheimer’s disease (AD) type tau accumulation as a proxy for neurodegenerative burden. Results Compared to HCs, patients with LLD showed significantly lower bilateral MTL volumes and WM microstructural differences primarily in the uncinate fasciculi bilaterally and right fornix. In patients with LLD, higher vascular burden, but not tau, was associated with lower MTL volume and more pronounced WM differences. Conclusions LLD was associated with both GM and WM differences in the MTL. Cerebrovascular disease, rather than AD type tau-mediated neurodegenerative processes, may contribute to brain tissue differences in LLD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":50,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
