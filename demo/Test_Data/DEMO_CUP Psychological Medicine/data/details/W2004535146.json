This is unlikely to be due to prodromal decline or known confounders. The association could be directly causal with cognitive impairment leading to false beliefs and perceptions, or could be indirect with any factors causing lower IQ, such as abnormal brain development increasing the risk for schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":14,"cited_by_count":466},"references":33,"networkCitations":14,"seed":false}
