With this issue Dr Kenneth S. Kendler joins as American Editor. Dr Kendler will be well known to the readership of Psychological Medicine . One of the most distinguished of psychiatric genetic epidemiologists, he is Rachel Brown Banks Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry, Professor of Human Genetics, and Co-Director of Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics at the Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University. He has been a contributor of papers to Psychological Medicine for many years, and a member of the Editorial Board since 1995. The proportion of papers which we publish from the Americas has been gradually increasing. They are now nearly one-third of all papers, mostly from the USA. There will be an additional editorial office in Richmond, Virginia and Dr Kendler will deal with submissions from the Americas, together with all submissions in psychiatric genetics, whatever their origin. Revised submission instructions are included in this issue. Our high standards for publication will continue. We also announce an additional smaller change. From now on each volume will include eight rather than six issues. The total number of pages per year will be unchanged, with issues slightly slimmer and a little more frequent. This will allow us to expedite publication of major papers, has advantages for the printers, and is similar to the pattern of eight issues per year adopted by what is now our sister Cambridge University Press publication, the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry . With this issue also a loss: after seven years Simon Wessely relinquishes the role of associate editor and book review editor. We are grateful to him for his many contributions and pleased that he has agreed to remain as a member of the Editorial Board.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":0,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
