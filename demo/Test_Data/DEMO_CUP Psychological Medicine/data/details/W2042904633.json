Tryptophan in CSF rose by 10%. There was concomitant morphological improvement in the jejunal mucosa, and the results would seem to indicate that the reduced central monoamine metabolism in untreated adult coeliacs is not primarily genetically determined but is probably related to the poor intestinal absorption.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":34},"references":30,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
