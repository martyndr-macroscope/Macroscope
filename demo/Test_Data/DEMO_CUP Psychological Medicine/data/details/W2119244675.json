(1993) presented two models of psychiatric morbidity that they claimed represented ‘individual’-based and ‘community’-based explanations. They used data from the Health and Lifestyle Survey to test the models and concluded that the data support a ‘community’-based explanation. Their deductions from the models appear to be flawed, nevertheless, their conclusion may be valid.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":9,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
