In the present study, we investigated affective and psychotic stress reactivity as well as its link with psychotic symptoms and psychopathology in youths with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a neurogenetic condition associated with a high risk for psychosis. Methods A 6-day ecological momentary assessment protocol was used to assess perceived daily-life stress as well as affective and psychotic reactivity to stress in participants with 22q11DS ( n = 38, age = 18.4) and healthy controls (HC; n = 53, age = 19.1). Psychotic symptoms, general psychopathology, and coping strategies were also assessed through clinical interviews and questionnaires. Results Participants with 22q11DS reported higher levels of perceived social stress ( b = 0.21, p = 0.036) but lower levels of activity-related stress ( b = −0.31, p = 0.003) in their daily lives compared to HC. The groups did not differ in affective or psychotic reactivity to stress, but individuals with 22q11DS who reported increased affective reactivity to social stressors showed more severe positive psychotic symptoms ( r s = 0.505, p = 0.008). Finally, avoidance coping strategies moderated the association between stress and negative affects. Conclusions Our results suggest an increased vulnerability for daily social stress in youths with 22q11DS, and link elevated social stress reactivity to heightened psychotic symptom severity. Given the high risk for psychosis in 22q11DS, interventions should focus on reducing social stress and developing adaptive coping strategies.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":8},"references":68,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
