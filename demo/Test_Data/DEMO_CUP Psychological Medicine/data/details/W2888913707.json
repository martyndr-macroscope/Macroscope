Features of identity confusion are central to both complicated bereavement and PTSD and these characteristics may be particularly prominent amongst refugees from traditional cultures displaced from their homelands, families, and kinship groups. We investigate whether a combined pattern of complicated bereavement and PTSD can be identified amongst West Papuan refugees participating in an epidemiological survey ( n = 486, response rate: 85.8%) in a remote town in Papua New Guinea. Methods Latent class analysis was applied to derive subpopulations of refugees based on symptoms of complicated bereavement and PTSD. Associations were examined between classes and traumatic loss events, post-migration living difficulties (PMLDs), and psychosocial support systems. Results The four classes identified comprised a complicated bereavement class (11%), a combined posttraumatic bereavement class (10%), a PTSD class (11%), and a low symptom class (67%). Symptoms of identity confusion were prominent in the posttraumatic bereavement class. Compared with the low symptom class, the combined posttraumatic bereavement class reported greater exposure to traumatic loss events (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.11–5.34), PMLDs (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.01–4.6), disruptions to interpersonal bonds and networks (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.47–7.38), and erosion of roles and identities (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.11–4.27). Conclusions Refugees appear to manifest a combined pattern of complicated bereavement and PTSD symptoms in which identity confusion is a prominent feature. This response appears to reflect the combined impact of high levels of exposure to traumatic losses, PMLDs, and disruption of relevant psychosocial systems.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":30},"references":44,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
