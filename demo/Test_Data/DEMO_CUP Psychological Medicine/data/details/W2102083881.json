There have been many developments in our understanding of what pragmatism really means, and excellent examples of truly pragmatic trials in psychiatry are currently available. Funders have helped encourage more emphasis on the need for such studies, but ‘local’ and trans-national regulations could help more. Consumers of the evidence should have a greater voice in generating the research agenda and, as this happens, the questions generated are more likely to be answered by a pragmatic approach to trials.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":17},"references":36,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
