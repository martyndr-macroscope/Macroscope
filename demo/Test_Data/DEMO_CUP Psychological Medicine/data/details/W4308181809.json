Integrative adapt therapy (IAT) is a scalable treatment addressing refugee-specific psychosocial challenges. Methods We report 12-month post-treatment data from a single-blind, active-controlled trial (October 2017–August 2019) where 327 Myanmar refugees in Malaysia were assigned to either six sessions of IAT ( n = 164) or cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) ( n = 163). Primary outcomes were posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD) symptom scores at treatment end and 12-month post-treatment. Secondary outcome was functional impairment. Results 282 (86.2%) participants were retained at 12-month follow-up. For both groups, large treatment effects for common mental disorders (CMD) symptoms were maintained at 12-month post-treatment compared to baseline ( d = 0.75–1.13). Although participants in IAT had greater symptom reductions and larger effect sizes than CBT participants for all CMDs at treatment end, there were no significant differences between treatment arms at 12-month post-treatment for PTSD [mean difference: −0.9, 95% CI (−2.5 to 0.6), p = 0.25], depression [mean difference: 0.1, 95% CI (−0.6 to 0.7), p = 0.89), anxiety [mean difference: −0.4, 95% CI (−1.4 to 0.6), p = 0.46], and PCBD [mean difference: −0.6, 95% CI (−3.1 to 1.9), p = 0.65]. CBT participants showed greater improvement in functioning than IAT participants at 12-month post-treatment [mean difference: −2.5, 95% CI (−4.7 to −0.3], p = 0.03]. No adverse effects were recorded for either therapy. Conclusions Both IAT and CBT showed sustained treatment gains for CMD symptoms amongst refugees over the 12-month period.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":4},"references":30,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
