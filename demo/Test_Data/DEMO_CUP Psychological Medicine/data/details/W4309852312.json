Mechanisms leading to increased risk of illness may involve emotional dysregulation and shortened leukocyte telomere length (LTL). Methods To evaluate whether (1) childhood maltreatment is associated with shorter LTL among older adults with CAD or other chronic illnesses; (2) sex and/or CAD status influence these results; and (3) symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress moderate or mediate the association between childhood maltreatment and LTL, men and women ( N = 1247; aged 65 ± 7.2 years) with and without CAD completed validated questionnaires on childhood maltreatment, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. LTL was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Analyses included bivariate correlations, hierarchical regressions, and moderation/mediation analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables. Results Childhood maltreatment was associated with significantly shorter LTL ( r = −0.059, p = 0.038, b = −0.016, p = 0.005). This relation was not moderated by depression, anxiety, nor perceived stress, though there was mitigated evidence for absence of a maltreatment-LTL relation in men with CAD. Stress perception (but not anxiety or depression) partially mediated the relation between childhood maltreatment and LTL [Indirect effect, b = −0.0041, s.e. = 0.002, 95% CI (−0.0085 to −0.0002)]. Conclusions Childhood maltreatment was associated with accelerated biological aging independently of patient characteristics. Emotional dysregulation resulting in chronic stress may contribute to this process. Whether stress management or other interventions may help prevent or slow premature aging in those who have suffered maltreatment requires study.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":84,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
