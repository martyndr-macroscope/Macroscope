Results indicated that all affective states induced more immune fluctuations (regardless of the direction) than the neutral state. Furthermore, among the affective states, anxiety induced the most immunological variability and depression the least.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":54},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
