The greatest increase in rates occurred among girls aged 15–19 (for events, persons and ‘first-ever’ episodes). Among teenagers the most marked increase occurred for those who were married: this group also reported a greater increase than did the non-married in the frequency of physical violence and Serious debt. ‘Marginal’ social-sexual roles have also become progressively more common in this age group. The 20- to 24-year group showed a more modest increase in rates, similar for the married and the non-married. In this age group there was no consistent pattern of change for reported violence or debt over the study period, nor were changes in these variables related to marital status. An increase in consumption of alcohol before parasuicide was noted for both age groups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":43},"references":19,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
