If grouping diverse symptoms under one heading is appropriate, they account for over half of all new presentations in secondary medical care (Nimnuan et al . 2001 a ) and a sizeable proportion of ‘frequent attenders’ in secondary care have predominantly medically unexplained symptoms (Fink, 1992 a ; Reid et al . 2002). Such symptoms are costly, persistent, and associated with significant disability and psychiatric disorder (Reid et al . 2001, 2003), but are generally ignored by mental health services (Bass et al . 2001).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":12},"references":29,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
