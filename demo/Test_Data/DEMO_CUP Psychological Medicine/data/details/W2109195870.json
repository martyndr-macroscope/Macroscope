The reliability was measured in a study involving six raters. The sources of information required were studied, in 20 patients, by comparing an interview with the patient, a similar interview with an informant and an analysis of the case records. A synopsis of interview and record data are necessary to obtain adequate information about longitudinal psychopathology and ‘lifetime’ diagnosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":8},"references":13,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
