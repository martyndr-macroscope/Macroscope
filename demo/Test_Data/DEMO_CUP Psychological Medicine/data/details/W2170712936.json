The difference between chronic thought disordered and non-thought disordered schizophrenics just failed to reach the 10% level of significance. On the Consistency measure results were variable. Only the acute non-thought disordered schizophrenics were significantly different from the acute and chronic thought disordered schizophrenics. The findings are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":7,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
