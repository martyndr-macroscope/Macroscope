Information concerning background, presenting illness and follow-up was compared with that from the case-records of patients with schizophrenic, affective and schizoaffective psychoses. The characteristic features of ‘cycloid psychosis’ were a female predominance and a remittent course. The ‘cycloid’ group resembled the conventional groups in some respects, but differences from schizophrenic, affective and, to a lesser extent, schizoaffective groups were also striking. The factors which might account for the apparent independence of the ‘cycloid’ group from other diagnostic categories are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":95},"references":26,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
