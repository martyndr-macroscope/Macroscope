The sample could not be divided into anxious and depressed groups on the basis of the clinical picture. The outcome tended to be good irrespective of medication but the significant drug effects found were due to amitriptyline and concerned measures of anxiety as well as depression. It is concluded that a distinction between anxiety and depression in neurotic out-patients is of no practical value with regard to drug treatment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":216},"references":33,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
