Forty-five males were classified according to one of three anger expression categories: those who did not suppress their anger ( N = 13), those who partially suppressed their anger ( N = 19), and those who definitely suppressed their anger ( N = 13). For each, we determined lymphocyte β-adrenergic receptor function and blood pressure responsiveness to a standardized mathematics stressor. Those subjects who routinely suppressed their expression of anger had increased β-adrenergic receptor sensitivity ( P = 0·01) (isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP production) and a greater systolic blood pressure response to the stressor ( P = 0·001). Anger suppression was unrelated to the subject's age, weight, or socioeconomic status. These findings may be germane to prior clinical and epidemiologic observations relating anger expression and cardiovascular illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":39},"references":45,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
