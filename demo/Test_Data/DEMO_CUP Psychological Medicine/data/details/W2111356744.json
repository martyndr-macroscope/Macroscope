The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the prevalence of ADHD in these populations. Method Primary research studies reporting the prevalence (lifetime/current) of ADHD in incarcerated populations were identified. The meta-analysis used a mixed log-binomial model, including fixed effects for each covariate and a random study effect, to estimate the significance of various risk factors. Results Forty-two studies were included in the analysis. ADHD prevalence was higher with screening diagnoses versus diagnostic interview (and with retrospective youth diagnoses versus current diagnoses). Using diagnostic interview data, the estimated prevalence was 25.5% and there were no significant differences for gender and age. Significant country differences were noted. Conclusions Compared with published general population prevalence, there is a fivefold increase in prevalence of ADHD in youth prison populations (30.1%) and a 10-fold increase in adult prison populations (26.2%).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":272},"references":66,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
