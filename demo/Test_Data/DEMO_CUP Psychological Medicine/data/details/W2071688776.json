Nystagmus and cerebellar ataxia quickly resolved when administered thiamine, although severe global amnesia consistent with Korsakoffs syndrome persisted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed infarction of the right temporal lobe with hippocampal atrophy, but no lesions of thalamus or atrophy of mammillary bodies. Positron emission tomography (PET) confirmed decreased cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (CMRglu) in the right temporal lobe corresponding to MRI findings, but also significant metabolic asymmetry of dorsal thalamus, i.e reduced CMRglu in left versus right. This patient is unique in that neuroradiological findings revealed intact mammillary bodies and suggest asymmetrical dysfunctions (structural right temporal and functional left diencephalic) to produce her profound amnesia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":12},"references":16,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
