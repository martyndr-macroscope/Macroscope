We mapped the connectome in patients with recently diagnosed and chronic schizophrenia and investigated the extent and overlap of white matter connectivity disruptions between these illness stages. Methods Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired in recent-onset ( n = 19) and chronic patients ( n = 45) with schizophrenia, as well as age-matched controls ( n = 87). Whole-brain fiber tracking was performed to quantify the strength of white matter connections. Connections were tested for significant streamline count reductions in recent-onset and chronic groups, relative to separate age-matched controls. Permutation tests were used to assess whether disrupted connections significantly overlapped between chronic and recent-onset patients. Linear regression was performed to test whether connectivity was strongest in controls, weakest in chronic patients, and midway between these extremities in recent-onset patients (controls &gt; recent-onset &gt; chronic). Results Compared with controls, chronic patients displayed a widespread network of connectivity disruptions ( p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, connectivity reductions were circumscribed to the anterior fibers of the corpus callosum in recent-onset patients ( p &lt; 0.01). A significant proportion of disrupted connections in recent-onset patients (86%) coincided with disrupted connections in chronic patients ( p &lt; 0.01). Linear regression revealed that chronic patients displayed reduced connectivity relative to controls, while recent-onset patients showed an intermediate reduction compared with chronic patients ( p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions Connectome pathology in recent-onset patients with schizophrenia is confined to select tracts within a more extensive network of white matter connectivity disruptions found in chronic illness. These findings may suggest a trajectory of progressive deterioration of connectivity in schizophrenia.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":50},"references":83,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
