This study aims to assess the association between this polymorphism and insulin resistance after antidepressant treatment in depressed patients. Methods One hundred forty-eight Caucasian patients with a current unipolar major depressive episode (DSM IV-TR) were genotyped for the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of antidepressant treatment for the ‘Homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance’ (HOMA-IR) index, a valid measure of insulin resistance based on fasting plasma insulinaemia and glycaemia. Because validity assumptions were fulfilled, data were analysed using analysis of variance for repeated measures. Results The 52 (35%) Met carriers and 96 (65%) Val/Val patients were not different at baseline for clinical characteristics and HOMA-IR. A significant Val66Met × time interaction ( p = 0.02), a significant time effect ( p = 0.03) and a significant Val66Met effect ( p = 0.0497) were shown for HOMA-IR. A significant Val66Met × time interaction ( p = 0.01) and a significant time effect ( p = 0.003) were shown for fasting glycaemia. HOMA-IR and fasting glycaemia changes after antidepressant treatment were significantly higher in Met carrier than in Val/Val patients (HOMA-IR changes: Met: 0.71 ± 3.29 v. Val/Val: −0.16 ± 1.34, t = 2.3, df = 146, p = 0.02, glycaemia changes: Met: 0.09 ± 0.30 v. Val/Val: 0.02 ± 0.16, t = −2.0, df = 146, p = 0.045). Conclusions The Met allele of the Val66Met BDNF polymorphism confers to depressed patients a higher risk of insulin-resistance after antidepressant treatment. These patients could benefit from specific monitoring of metabolism and preventive measures.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":41,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
