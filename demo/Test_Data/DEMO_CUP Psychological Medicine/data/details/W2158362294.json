Relatives of schizophrenic probands were also tested. Relatives with an abnormal P300 had a similar range of neuropsychological deficits as were found in the schizophrenic group and relatives with a normal P300 response performed as well as the normal control group. The results suggest that neurophysiological and neuropsychological testing of relatives may help to clarify the mode of inheritance of schizophrenia in some families.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":97},"references":56,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
