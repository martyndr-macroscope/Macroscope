The present study relies on questionnaire data from a hypertension screening carried out on the entire adult population of a medium-sized, Norwegian county (total number of participants = 74977). ‘Labelled’ individuals, i.e. previously unaware hypertensives ( N = 173), false positives ( N = 233), and patients in need of continued BP control (N = 474) have been followed up after 1–3 years, and comparisons are made with aware hypertensives ( N = 206), patients previously treated for hypertension ( N = 118), and a random sample of normotensives ( N = 2326). ‘Pre-labelling’, baseline measures of subjective well-being had been carried out on all comparison groups in connection with the screening. Changes in psychological well-being are not significantly related to labelling or BP-status. However, there is a deterioration in psychological well-being among participants who have been subjected to one or more negative life events/stresses (other than labelling) in the preceding 12 months.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":102},"references":48,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
