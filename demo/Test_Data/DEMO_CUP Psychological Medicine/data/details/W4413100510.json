In first-episode psychosis (FEP), the proportion of people admitted to hospital at initial presentation is still unknown. Methods This systematic review aimed to determine the proportion of people with FEP who are admitted at initial presentation (within 30 days from point of first contact with psychiatry) and the influence of individual, clinical, and service factors on admission risk. Four databases were searched from inception until June 2023: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. The pooled proportion of people admitted was calculated using a random-effects model. Analyses were further stratified according to individual, clinical, and service factors. Results Of 7,455 abstracts screened, 18 studies with 19,854 participants were included. The proportion of people admitted overall was 51% ( k = 18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 37–65%; I 2 : 99.56%). The proportion admitted involuntarily was 31% ( k = 6, 95% CI: 23–40%; I 2 : 95.26%). Sub-analyses for sex, diagnosis, and early intervention service access did not show significant differences between groups. The proportion of people with a short duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) admitted was 59% ( k = 2, 95% CI: 56–63%) vs. 37% ( k = 2, 95% CI: 33–41%) for long DUP, which was significant ( p &lt; 0.001). High inter-study heterogeneity was observed. Conclusions Results demonstrate that over half of the people are hospitalized when initially presenting for FEP, a high proportion, with consequences for individuals and health services at large. First, service contact must be prioritized as an opportunity for appropriate intervention, to either avoid unwarranted hospitalizations or if hospitalization is required, to ensure the application of focused therapeutic objectives within intended timeframes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":65,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
