This study explores this question directly using taxometric procedures. Method Seven hundred and eleven working adults completed an index of health anxiety [the Whiteley Index (WI)] and indicated their current health status. Data from those who were currently healthy ( n =501) and receiving no medical treatment were examined using three taxometric procedures: mean above minus below a cut (MAMBAC), maximum eigenvalue (MAXEIGEN) and L-mode factor analysis (L-MODE). Results Graphical representations (comparing actual to simulated data) and fit indices indicate that health anxiety is more accurately represented as a dimensional rather than a categorical construct. Conclusions Health anxiety is better represented as a dimensional construct. Implications for theory development and clinical practice are examined.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":182},"references":59,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
