During periods of good sleep the overall growth rate averaged 1·04 cm per month, and during periods of poor sleep it averaged 0·34 cm per month ( t =8·46, df=32, P&lt;0·001). Presumably, good growth, good sleep, and optimal nocturnal somatotropin release intercorrelate in this syndrome of dwarfism, but the data with regard to nocturnal somatotropin release remain to be demonstrated empirically.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":61},"references":24,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
