Although each theory has its strengths, it is argued that an adequate cognitive account of depression is awaited. Such a theory must link specific experiences with each of the cognitive themes of depression, and the links postulated should be specific to depression. Refinements of description and method are required before such a theory can be tested.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":28},"references":46,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
