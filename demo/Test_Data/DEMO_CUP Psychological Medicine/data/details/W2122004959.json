Internal consistency, item frequency, factor dimensions, and correlation with Eysenck's ‘N’ were analysed in a sample of 882 non-psychiatric pregnant women. The BDI showed a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0·85). Factor analysis yielded two major factors. Low BDI scores were determined mainly by items related to somatic complaints or decreased activity without unequivocal depressive content. In contrast, it was unambiguous depressive items that were endorsed in high scores, and these showed higher correlations with neuroticism. It is concluded that in non-psychiatric populations the BDI may measure conditions other than depression and that low or medium range scores should not be interpreted as indicators of mild depressive symptomatology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":45},"references":17,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
