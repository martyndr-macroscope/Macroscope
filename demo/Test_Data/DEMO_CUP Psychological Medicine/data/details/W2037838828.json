Twenty-one factors were produced, including three dealing with cognitive impairment. Although it was found that elderly depressives show a profile of psychopathology quite different from that shown by patients with organic disorder, it was also found that patients with an apparently functional disorder may sometimes be diagnosed as an organic disorder, that subjective complaints of intellectual impairment are not good indicators of organic disorders and may be associated with a depressive factor, and that complaints that could be dismissed as attributes of ageing may actually be indicative of a depressive disorder in the elderly. The methodological implications, as well as the limitations of the sample size, are discussed.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":111},"references":7,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
