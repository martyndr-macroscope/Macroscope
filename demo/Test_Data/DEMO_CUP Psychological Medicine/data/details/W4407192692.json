This study examined whether a key reinforcement learning behavioral pattern characterized by reduced difficulty learning from rewards that have been found to underlie negative symptoms in those with a schizophrenia diagnosis also contributes to negative symptoms in those at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. Methods CHR youth ( n = 46) and 51 healthy controls (CN) completed an explicit reinforcement learning task with two phases. During the acquisition phase, participants learned to select between pairs of stimuli probabilistically reinforced with feedback indicating receipt of monetary gains or avoidance of losses. Following training, the transfer phase required participants to select between pairs of previously presented stimuli during the acquisition phase and novel stimuli without receiving feedback. These test phase pairings allowed for inferences about the contributions of prediction error and value representation mechanisms to reinforcement learning deficits. Results In acquisition, CHR participants displayed impaired learning from gains specifically that were associated with greater negative symptom severity. Transfer performance indicated these acquisition deficits were largely driven by value representation deficits. In addition to negative symptoms, this profile of deficits was associated with a greater risk of conversion to psychosis and lower functioning. Conclusions Impairments in positive reinforcement learning, specifically effectively representing reward value, may be an important transphasic mechanism of negative symptoms and a marker of psychosis liability.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":79,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
