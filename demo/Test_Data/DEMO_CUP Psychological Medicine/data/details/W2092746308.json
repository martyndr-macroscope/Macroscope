This study examined the association between job strain and psychiatric morbidity using interview-based assessments of mental health. We assessed the prevalence of neurotic disorder in high job strain (high demand, low control) and low job strain (low demand, high control) school teachers, and compared these rates with data from individuals with similar educational qualifications from the National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of Great Britain. Methods. One hundred and sixty primary and secondary school teachers were selected from a larger survey on the basis of high or low job strain, and were assessed for psychiatric morbidity using the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). The prevalence of neurotic symptoms and a total psychiatric morbidity score were calculated. Results. After adjusting for age, gender and occupational grade, the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was greater in high job strain than low job strain individuals. The prevalence of severe anxiety, worry and fatigue symptoms was significantly greater in the high job strain teachers. In comparison with the British psychiatric morbidity survey, the prevalence of neurotic disorders was greater in the high job strain, but not in low job strain teachers. Individuals in the low job strain group were more likely to report severe anxiety, irritability and fatigue in the week prior to interview, than comparably educated individuals in the national survey. Conclusion. Job strain is associated with psychiatric morbidity. The high levels of neurotic psychopathology among teachers is consistent with previous research that has found teaching to be a highly stressful occupation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":145},"references":12,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
