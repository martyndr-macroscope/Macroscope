It also aimed to establish materials to differentiate individuals with this condition from a comparable non-Asperger group. Asperger subjects tended to be poorer than comparable patients on all subtests.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":31},"references":16,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
