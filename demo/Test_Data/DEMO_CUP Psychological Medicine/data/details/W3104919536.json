Converging research strands indicate that rest–activity rhythms can help characterize BD-I and might differentiate good responders (GR) and non-responders (NR). Methods Seventy outpatients with BD-I receiving Li prophylaxis were categorized as GR or NR according to the ratings on the retrospective assessment of response to lithium scale (Alda scale). Participants undertook 21 consecutive days of actigraphy monitoring of sleep quantity (SQ), sleep variability (SV) and circadian rhythmicity (CR). Results Twenty-five individuals were categorized as GR (36%). After correcting statistical analysis to minimize false discoveries, four variables (intra-daily variability; median activity level; amplitude; and relative amplitude of activity) significantly differentiated GR from NR. The odds of being classified as a GR case were greatest for individuals showing more regular/stable CR (1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08, 2.05; p &lt; 0.04). Also, there was a trend for lower SV to be associated with GR (odds ratio: 0.56; 95% CI 0.31, 1.01; p &lt; 0.06). Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the largest actigraphy study of rest–activity rhythms and Li response. Circadian markers associated with fragmentation, variability, amount and/or amplitude of day and night-time activity best-identified GR. However, associations were modest and future research must determine whether these objectively measured parameters, singly or together, represent robust treatment response biomarkers. Actigraphy may offer an adjunct to multi-platform approaches aimed at developing personalized treatments or stratification of individuals with BD-I into treatment-relevant subgroups.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":19},"references":71,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
