Several important biological correlates of the effect of IFN- α on mood have been described, but the neuropsychological changes associated with IFN- α treatment are largely unexplored. The aim of the present preliminary study was to assess the effect of IFN- α on measures of emotional processing. Method We measured changes in emotional processing over 6–8 weeks in 17 patients receiving IFN- α as part of their treatment for hepatitis C virus infection. Emotional processing tasks included those which have previously been shown to be sensitive to the effects of depression and antidepressant treatment, namely facial expression recognition, emotional categorisation and the dot probe attentional task. Results Following IFN- α , patients were more accurate at detecting facial expressions of disgust; they also showed diminished attentional vigilance to happy faces. IFN- α produced the expected increases in scores on depression rating scales, but there was no correlation between these scores and the changes in emotional processing. Conclusions Our preliminary findings suggest that IFN- α treatment produces negative biases in emotional processing, and this effect is not simply a consequence of depression. It is possible that increased recognition of disgust may represent a neuropsychological marker of depressive disorders related to inflammation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":19},"references":53,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
