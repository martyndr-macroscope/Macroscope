Great care is required in the selection of drugs which act upon specific monoamine receptors to produce specific hormonal responses. Equal care is required in the control of biological variables which may influence hormonal release. Recently reported neuroendocrine studies of depressive illness are assessed in these terms. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that there is defective noradrenergic function in the brains of some patients with depressive illness.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":225},"references":182,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
