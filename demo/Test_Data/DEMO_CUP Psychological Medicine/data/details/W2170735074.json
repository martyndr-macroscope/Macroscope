Although there was a possible tendency for manic attacks to increase in prevalence and severity with age, it was difficult to demonstrate a general age-related decline in lithium efficacy. There was a tendency for the prevalence and severity of fine hand tremor to increase with age. This was not seen with polydipsia/polyuria, the other typical lithium side-effect.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":65},"references":12,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
