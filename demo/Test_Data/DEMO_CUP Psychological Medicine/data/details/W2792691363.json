This study explored if (1) DBS is associated with changes in personality in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD), (2) how personality dimensions and depression are associated, and (3) if TRD patients’ self-ratings of personality are valid. Methods TRD patients were assessed before DBS ( n = 30), 6 months (t2, n = 21), 2 (t3, n = 17) and 5 years (t4, n = 11) after the initiation of DBS of the supero-lateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle (slMFB-DBS). Personality was measured with the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), depression severity with Hamilton (HDRS), and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Results Personality dimensions did not change with slMFB-DBS compared with baseline. Extraversion was negatively correlated with HDRS 28 ( r = −0.48, p &lt; 0.05) and MADRS ( r = −0.45, p &lt; 0.05) at t2. Inter-rater reliability was high for the NEO-FFI at baseline (Cronbach's α = 0.74) and at t4 ( α = 0.65). Extraversion [ t (29) = −5.20; p &lt; 0.001] and openness to experience [ t (29) = −6.96; p &lt; 0.001] differed statistically significant from the normative sample, and did not predict the antidepressant response. Conclusions slMFB-DBS was not associated with a change in personality. The severity of depression was associated with extraversion. Personality of TRD patients differed from the healthy population and did not change with response, indicating a possible scar effect. Self-ratings of personality seem valid to assess personality during TRD.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":26},"references":46,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
