Measures of verbal, non-verbal, recognition and recall memory were derived from the tests administered and were viewed in relation to the lateral ventricle and third ventricular size measurements. The results showed that the memory performance of male alcoholics was significantly related to measures of third ventricular size, but probably not to measures of the lateral ventricles. An association between verbal memory performance and CT scan measures was found in the male controls.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":27},"references":28,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
