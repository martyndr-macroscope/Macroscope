Five per cent of the mesial temporal sclerosis group and 23% of the alien tissue group were psychotic. A marked interaction occurred between psychosis and ‘left handedness’. In the alien tissue group, females, especially left-handed females, were the most likely to have developed a schizophrenia-like psychosis.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":239},"references":24,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
