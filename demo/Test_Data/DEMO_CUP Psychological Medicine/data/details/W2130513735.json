A new feature of the meeting was the ‘work group’, an opportunity to debate topical but unresolved issues. There was standing room only for a discussion on why the differences between self-report and clinician-rated measures of psychopathology matter (Brugha et al . 1999 a ). This is one of several topics increasingly debated in the context of the seemingly unremitting disparities between epidemiological estimates of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders (Regier et al . 1998). Recent comparisons of clinician and lay (self-report) measures suggest that dichotomous diagnostic categories cannot be measured reliably in large scale community surveys against a clinical standard measure (Brugha, et al . 1999 b , 2001; Eaton et al . 2000).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":32},"references":39,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
