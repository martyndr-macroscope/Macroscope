The two sets of rates showed similar trends among 20 electoral wards, both being related to socioeconomic indices. They also varied widely among the 100 schools in the borough, being higher for schools of low privilege in the educational system. The school rates appeared to vary independently of neighbourhood effects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":42},"references":12,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
