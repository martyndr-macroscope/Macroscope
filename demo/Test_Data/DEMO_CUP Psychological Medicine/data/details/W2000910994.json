The Present State Examination was used to assess psychiatric morbidity. Childhood experiences assessed included childhood demographic factors and ‘loss and deprivation’ variables. The latter group comprised maternal and paternal deaths and separations and other disruptions in parental care. ‘Loss and deprivation’ in combination accounted for between 4·5 and 5·5% of the variance in adult psychiatric morbidity","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":26},"references":16,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
