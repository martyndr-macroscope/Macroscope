A shared aetiology and/or a causal relationship could explain their correlation. In the current study, we explore these explanations for the association between ADHD symptoms and emotional problems from childhood to adulthood. Methods Data were drawn from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), including 3675 identical and 7063 non-identical twin pairs. ADHD symptoms and emotional symptoms were reported by parents from childhood to adulthood. Self-report scales were included from early adolescence. Five direction of causation (DoC) twin models were fitted to distinguish whether associations were better explained by shared aetiology and/or causal relationships in early childhood, mid-childhood, early adolescence, late adolescence, and early adulthood. Follow-up analyses explored associations for the two subdomains of ADHD symptoms, hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention, separately. Results The association between ADHD symptoms and emotional problems increased in magnitude from early childhood to adulthood. In the best-fitting models, positive genetic overlap played an important role in this association at all stages. A negative causal effect running from ADHD symptoms to emotional problems was also detected in early childhood and mid-childhood. When distinguishing ADHD subdomains, the apparent protective effect of ADHD symptoms on emotional problems in childhood was mostly driven by hyperactivity-impulsivity. Conclusions Genetic overlap plays an important role in the association between ADHD symptoms and emotional problems. Hyperactivity-impulsivity may protect children from emotional problems in childhood, but this protective effect diminishes after adolescence.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":4},"references":77,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
