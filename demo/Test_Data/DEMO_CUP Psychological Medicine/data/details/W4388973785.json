However, it is unclear if the N100 is a psychosis endophenotype that is also altered in the relatives of patients. Methods We conducted a family study using the auditory oddball paradigm to compare the N100 amplitude and latency across 243 patients with psychosis, 86 unaffected relatives, and 194 controls. We then conducted a systematic review and a random-effects meta-analysis pooling our results and 14 previously published family studies. We compared data from a total of 999 patients, 1192 relatives, and 1253 controls in order to investigate the evidence and degree of N100 differences. Results In our family study, patients showed reduced N100 amplitudes and prolonged N100 latencies compared to controls, but no significant differences were found between unaffected relatives and controls. The meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction of the N100 amplitude and delay of the N100 latency in both patients with psychosis (standardized mean difference [ s.m.d. ] = −0.48 for N100 amplitude and s.m.d. = 0.43 for N100 latency) and their relatives ( s.m.d. = − 0.19 for N100 amplitude and s.m.d. = 0.33 for N100 latency). However, only the N100 latency changes in relatives remained significant when excluding studies with affected relatives. Conclusions N100 changes, especially prolonged N100 latencies, are present in both patients with psychosis and their relatives, making the N100 a promising endophenotype for psychosis. Such changes in the N100 may reflect changes in early auditory processing underlying the etiology of psychosis.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":74,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
