The 2-week prevalence of psychotropic drug consumption was found to be 10·9 %, an almost identical figure to that obtained in an earlier survey conducted 8 years previously. The reasons for the absence of the expected rise in prevalence of consumption are discussed. Consumption was found to be strongly associated with various measures of health, and there was a marked sex difference in drug consumption (females &gt; males) which was independent of health.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":70},"references":35,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
