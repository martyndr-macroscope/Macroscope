Method Participants in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study (CDS) who completed at least 20 years of follow-up and who met study criteria for bipolar I or schizo-affective manic disorder, before intake or during follow-up, were divided by age at intake into youngest (18–29 years, n =56), middle (30–44 years, n =68) and oldest (&gt;44 years, n =24) groups. Results The persistence of depressive symptoms increased significantly in the two younger groups. Earlier ages of onset were associated with higher depressive morbidity throughout the 20 years of follow-up but did not predict changes in symptom persistence. The proportions of weeks spent in episodes of either pole correlated across follow-up periods in all age groupings, although correlations were stronger for depressive symptoms and for shorter intervals. Conclusions Regardless of age at onset, the passage of decades in bipolar illness seems to bring an increase in the predominance of depressive symptoms in individuals in their third, fourth and fifth decades and an earlier age of onset portends a persistently greater depressive symptom burden. The degree to which either depression or manic/hypomanic symptoms persist has significant stability over lengthy periods and seems to reflect traits that manifest early in an individual's illness.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":38},"references":17,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
