Methods Data collected from adolescent girls ( N = 496; M age = 13.02, s.d. = 0.73) who completed a diagnostic interview annually over an 8-year period were used to address these aims. Results For all four eating disorders, compensatory weight-control behaviors were the first behavioral symptom to emerge and weight/shape overvaluation was the first cognitive symptom to emerge. Moreover, lower-than-expected BMI predicted future AN onset, binge eating and all cognitive symptoms predicted future BN onset, weight/shape overvaluation predicted future BED onset, and compensatory behavior and all cognitive symptoms predicted future PD onset. These predictive effects were small-to-large in magnitude. Collectively, prodromal symptoms predicted an eating disorder onset with 83–87% accuracy. Conclusions Results suggest that compensatory weight-control behaviors and weight/shape overvaluation typically emerge before other prodromal symptoms in all eating disorders during adolescence. Moreover, different prodromal symptoms seem to predict future onset of different eating disorders. Screening adolescent girls for these prodromal symptoms and implementing indicated prevention programs designed to reduce these symptoms may prove effective in preventing future onset of eating disorders.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":13},"references":30,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
