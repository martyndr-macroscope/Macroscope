Cohorts of depressed patients were identified in Basle, Montreal, Nagasaki, Teheran and Tokyo. The patients were assessed using standardized measures of social and clinical functioning. Ten-year follow-up data on clinical course, service contact, suicidal acts and social function outcomes were available for 439 (79%) patients. Over one-third (36%) were re-admitted at least once in the follow-up period, half of whom (18%) had very poor clinical outcome. Twenty-four per cent suffered severe social impairment for over half the follow-up period, and over one-fifth (21%) showed no full remissions. The best clinical course (one or two reasonably short episodes of depression with complete remission between episodes) was experienced twice as frequently in patients with a diagnosis of endogenous (65%) as in those diagnosed as suffering from psychogenic depression (29%). Among all patients, a fifth (22%) had at least one episode lasting for more than 1 year, and 10% had an episode lasting over 2 years during follow-up. Death by suicide occurred in 11% of patients, with a further 14% making unsuccessful suicide attempts.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":108},"references":22,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
