Some scans appeared abnormal. The mean ventricular/brain area measured by planimetry was increased over mean values in an age- and sex-matched group of control subjects but was less than that in a group of alcoholics. There was no significant relationship between CT scan appearances and the duration of benzodiazepine therapy. The clinical significance of the findings is unclear.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":97},"references":9,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
