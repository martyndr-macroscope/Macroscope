Thematic Review\n\n### Philosophical Foundations and Ethical Considerations of Biomimicry\n\nBiomimicry's philosophical foundations and ethical considerations are crucial for understanding its role in sustainable development. By examining the relationship between humans and nature, various scholars propose frameworks that challenge traditional views and advocate for a more integrated approach to ecological ethics. These discussions highlight the need for a critical perspective on how biomimicry can inform ethical practices in technology and design.\n\n- [1] Dicks (2015) discusses the philosophical inquiries surrounding biomimicry, proposing 'enlightened naturalism' as a new paradigm that sees nature as the ultimate source of truth and wisdom.\n- [6] McCormick (2025) critiques the technology-centric view of sustainability, advocating for a bio-inspired architectural model that fosters ethical relationships with nature and prepares designers for climate change challenges.\n- [12] Dicks (2017) explores the intersection of environmental and biomimetic ethics, arguing that nature should serve as a normative standard for sustainable practices rather than merely a duty to protect.\n- [13] Broeckhoven (2023) emphasizes the ethical implications of biomimetics in technological innovation, calling for a critical perspective to balance innovation with ethical responsibility.\n- [20] Estadieu (2025) reviews bioinspired approaches, highlighting their potential to reshape human-nature relationships and ethical frameworks, while addressing the limitations in fostering ecological sustainability.\n- [36] Pitrou (2020) critiques the simplistic imitation of nature in biomimicry, advocating for a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between humans and the natural world.\n\n### Biomimicry in Technological Innovation and Design\n\nBiomimicry in technological innovation and design draws inspiration from natural systems to create solutions that are efficient and sustainable. This approach spans various fields, including robotics and architecture, and emphasizes the importance of understanding biological principles to enhance technological capabilities.

Thematic Review\n\n### Nature-Based Solutions and Urban Circularity\n\nNature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly recognized as vital components in promoting urban circularity and addressing climate change challenges. By integrating NBS into urban planning, cities can enhance resource management, improve resilience, and foster sustainable environments. This approach not only supports ecosystem restoration but also offers multiple social benefits, highlighting the need for greater awareness and investment in these strategies.\n\n- The opinion paper [2] discusses how NBS can facilitate a transition to a circular economy, enhancing resilience and ecosystem restoration while maintaining economic growth.\n- In [4], the authors explore how integrating NBS within urban circular economies can address resource depletion and ecosystem degradation, promoting sustainable urban environments.\n- The article [5] emphasizes the role of green roofs as NBS that enhance urban sustainability and resilience, outlining necessary steps for their effective integration into city planning.\n- Paper [6] identifies key urban circularity challenges in water management and advocates for leveraging NBS to restore the water cycle and improve waste treatment.\n- A thematic analysis in [8] reveals diverse stakeholder perceptions of NBS in urban planning across six European cities, highlighting the importance of engagement in greening initiatives.\n- The framework presented in [19] discusses how NBS can enhance resource management across various urban sectors, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to urban sustainability.\n- In [50], the review outlines the benefits of NBS in promoting circular economies and presents a framework for their implementation in urban environments.\n- The study [67] explores multipurpose NBS interventions, such as combining green roofs with solar panels, to enhance urban sustainability and efficiency.\n\n### Sustainable Practices in the Built Environment\n\nSustainable practices in the built environment are increasingly recognized as essential for addressing environmental challenges and promoting resource efficiency. The integration of circular economy principles, green materials, and innovative technologies plays a crucial role in shaping a more sustainable future for construction and architecture. Research highlights the importance of collaboration and policy reforms to enhance sustainability efforts across various sectors [1][9][80].\n\n- This paper analyzes the evolution of the circular economy within the building and construction sector, emphasizing sustainable practices and resource efficiency [1].\n- The review discusses the significance of green building materials in sustainable architecture, highlighting innovations and challenges in their adoption [9].\n- This work outlines strategies for integrating circular economy principles into the built environment, advocating for public procurement to promote sustainability [16].\n- The study examines the importance of green buildings and retrofitting in public structures, emphasizing their benefits over new constructions [35].\n- This research investigates the role of product certification in promoting circular economy practices, revealing significant reliance on life cycle assessment for environmental impact evaluation [44].\n- The paper discusses building reuse as a strategy for promoting circularity and energy transition in urban environments, supported by innovative technologies [73].\n- This study presents a framework for evaluating circular economy strategies in the built environment, focusing on construction and demolition waste management [74].\n- The report outlines Hungary's strategy for transitioning to a circular economy by 2040, emphasizing the need for policy reforms to enhance sustainability [80].\n\n### Water Management and Circular Economy\n\nWater management is increasingly being integrated into the circular economy through innovative approaches such as Nature-Based Solutions (NBS). These strategies not only address urban water challenges but also promote sustainability and resource efficiency.

Thematic Review\n\n### Metaphors in Science Communication\n\nMetaphors play a crucial role in science communication, serving as tools to bridge complex scientific concepts and lay understanding. They can shape public perceptions and ethical discussions, particularly in emerging fields like epigenetics and synthetic biology. The use of metaphors not only aids comprehension but also reflects the evolving nature of scientific discourse.\n\n- **[1]** This article discusses the challenges of defining target domains for metaphors in epigenetics, highlighting the ongoing struggles among scientists to communicate its meaning effectively.\n- **[5]** The authors argue that metaphors in synthetic biology shape ethical and social implications, emphasizing their importance in fostering interdisciplinary dialogue about responsible innovation.\n- **[19]** This study reveals how scientists use metaphors during interviews, suggesting that they enhance understanding and engagement with complex scientific ideas among diverse audiences.\n- **[26]** By comparing expert and public understanding of metaphors in epigenetics, this research shows that while metaphor frequency is similar, their functions differ significantly between these groups.\n- **[28]** Analyzing metaphors in popular science texts about genetic engineering, this study highlights how phrases like \"designer babies\" influence public understanding and ethical discourse surrounding genome editing.\n\n### Ethical and Social Implications of Epigenetics\n\nThe ethical and social implications of epigenetics are multifaceted, reflecting concerns about maternal responsibility, societal norms, and the potential for misunderstanding in public discourse. As epigenetics continues to evolve, it raises critical questions about how scientific findings are interpreted and applied in social contexts, necessitating a careful examination of biases and assumptions that may influence research outcomes [2][3][4].\n\n- Kenney (2017) discusses how environmental epigenetics intersects with motherhood, arguing that \"research tends to illustrate rather than interrogate existing stereotypes about maternal agency\" [2]. This highlights the need for critical analysis of political dimensions in biosocial research.\n- Dupras (2019) provides a multidisciplinary review of epigenetics, ethics, law, and society, emphasizing the coexistence of optimistic and cautionary perspectives and calling for further exploration of the nuanced implications of epigenetics for policy [3].\n- Hendrickx (2018) argues that epigenetics should be viewed as a mode of thinking that encourages relational and ecological perspectives, suggesting that it influences societal norms and values [4].\n- Dubois (2019) examines the public interest in epigenetics, noting that it fuels a collective \"illusion\" of control and empowerment, which can lead to misconceptions about the science [10].\n- Pelletier (2019) critiques the premature conclusions drawn from popular literature regarding parental responsibility for epigenetic transmission, emphasizing the importance of epistemological considerations to clarify misunderstandings [34].\n\n### Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Biosocial Research\n\nThe theme of interdisciplinary perspectives on biosocial research highlights the intricate relationships between biological and social factors in shaping human experiences. By integrating insights from genetics, environment, and cultural contexts, these studies advocate for a more holistic understanding of health and behavior. This approach is essential for addressing complex issues such as child obesity, mental health, and the lived experiences of individuals across different cultures [6][12][31].\n\n- The biosocial genome? [6]: This article emphasizes the importance of understanding the interplay between biological and social factors in human health, arguing for an integrated perspective.\n- Gene-Environment Interplay in Child Eating Behaviors [12]: This review discusses how both genetic and environmental influences shape children's eating behaviors, urging researchers to explore their interactions.\n- ‘Nonetheless biosocial’: experiences and embodied knowledge of birth cohort participants in the UK and Brazil [31]: This study critiques the narrow focus of biosocial research, advocating for the inclusion of diverse public perspectives to enrich understanding.\n- RAPPROCHEMENT DES PÔLES NATURE ET CULTURE PAR LA RECHERCHE EN ÉPIGÉNÉTIQUE [25]: The article discusses an anticipated epistemological shift in understanding biological and cultural interactions through epigenetic research, calling for deeper integration of these fields.\n- The Body and Mind in Context: The Role of Trauma and Adversity [33]: This chapter critiques reductionist views of mental health, emphasizing the significant impact of trauma and chronic stress on emotional well-being.\n\n### Public Engagement and Genomics\n\nPublic engagement in genomics is crucial for understanding its societal implications and shaping policy. The evolving landscape of direct-to-consumer genomics and public attitudes towards genetic data sharing highlight the need for informed dialogue. As the field progresses, effective communication strategies will be essential to navigate the complexities of genomic science and its impact on health and identity.\n\n- The article \"[A market in the making: the past, present and future of direct-to-consumer genomics](8)\" examines how direct-to-consumer genomics is reshaping personal health narratives and the market dynamics involved. It notes that \"the market is still in its formative stages, with evolving regulations\" [8].\n  \n- In the study \"'Your DNA, Your Say': Global Survey Gathering Attitudes Toward Genomics\" [9], researchers conducted a global survey to assess public attitudes towards DNA donation and data sharing. The findings aim to inform policy regarding the use of anonymous data and address concerns about reidentification risks [9].\n\n- The paper \"Communicating science: epigenetics in the spotlight\" [15] critiques media representations of epigenetics, emphasizing the need for improved science communication strategies. It highlights that \"epigenetics is transforming our understanding of the nature versus nurture debate\" [15].\n\n- The article \"The complexity of the gene and the precision of CRISPR\" [17] discusses the polarized governance debate surrounding CRISPR technology, arguing that a lack of public engagement contributes to misunderstandings about gene editing. It calls for a more nuanced understanding to facilitate better public discourse [17].\n\n- In \"Exposing, Reversing, and Inheriting Crimes as Traumas from the Neurosciences to Epigenetics\" [24], the author explores the implications of neuroscientific advancements on criminal law, cautioning against premature changes in legal practices based on biological insights. The paper argues that \"epigenetic findings are not yet robust enough to justify such revisions\" [24].\n\n### The Role of Technology in Identity and Experience\n\nThe intersection of technology and identity is increasingly complex, as digital advancements reshape personal experiences and perceptions of self. In this context, the works of Zwart [7] and [32] highlight the dual nature of technology, illustrating how it can both enhance and diminish individual identity. Additionally, Szymanski [36] emphasizes the critical role of language in shaping scientific understanding, further complicating our relationship with technology and identity.\n\n- Zwart [7] discusses how the terabyte era leads to a sense of disembodiment, raising ethical questions about existence in a data-driven world. He states, \"Technology has the power to alter our sense of self.\"\n- In a similar vein, Zwart [32] examines the tension between personal identity and depersonalization in genomics, using the Snyderome to illustrate how data can both enhance and diminish individuality.\n- Szymanski [36] argues that language is a fundamental component of scientific inquiry, influencing how we conceptualize and interact with microbial life, thus impacting our identity within scientific contexts.\n\n**Peripheral & emerging (coverage addendum)**\n\n- Winett (2016) discusses framing strategies to mitigate mother-blame in public health communications regarding maternal health issues. [11]  \n- Pickersgill (2020) explores how novelty is constructed within scientific discourse, emphasizing the negotiation of new ideas. [13]  \n- Saukko (2017) analyzes the shift in metaphors used in direct-to-consumer genetic testing, from information to big data. [14]  \n- Le Goff (2021) examines epimutation and its implications for heritable changeability in genetics. [16]  \n- Ahmedien (2022) investigates the epistemic landscape of bio-art, focusing on metaphorical representations in the field. [18]  \n- Szymanski (2018) identifies the diverse users of synthetic DNA and the metaphors that shape their understanding.

Thematic Review\n\n### Cultural Approaches to Communication and Engagement\n\nCultural approaches to communication and engagement highlight the importance of narratives, identity, and emotion in shaping public discourse. By framing science communication as a cultural practice, researchers emphasize the need for a more nuanced understanding of how people connect with scientific information. This perspective encourages moving beyond traditional models of communication to foster deeper engagement with diverse audiences.\n\n- [1] Sarah R. Davies (2019) argues that \"science communication is not external to culture\" and should be viewed as a form of storytelling that enhances public engagement through shared identities and emotions.\n- [35] Sara R. Davies (2022) similarly emphasizes the intertwining of science and culture, advocating for a collective creation of meaning that enriches public discourse and understanding of science.\n\n### Social Movements and Democratic Practices\n\nSocial movements play a vital role in shaping democratic practices, emphasizing the need for adaptability and inclusivity in contemporary activism. Through various lenses, these papers explore the dynamics of collaboration, the tension between productivity and precariousness, and the innovative approaches necessary for effective democratic engagement in response to social challenges.\n\n- Nora Rigamonti's chapter, \"Kollaborative Versammlungen gestalten und dicht beschreiben,\" examines collaborative assemblies in social movements, highlighting that \"collaborative assemblies play a crucial role in contemporary activism\" [5].\n- In \"Demokratische Ordnungen in(ter)ventiv pluralisieren und modifizieren,\" Rigamonti argues for the necessity of evolving democratic structures to remain relevant, stating that \"inclusivity is key to effective democratic governance\" [6].\n- The chapter \"In(ter)ventive Demokratie - The Task Before Us?\" discusses the innovative approaches needed in democratic practices, emphasizing that \"the task before us is to innovate democracy\" [7].\n- Rigamonti's \"Zukunftsszenario I: Kooperation, Komposition und nachhaltige Entschleunigung\" explores how cooperation and sustainable practices can reshape societal frameworks, asserting that \"collaboration is key to fostering social change\" [10].\n- In \"Zwischen Produktivität und Prekarität,\" the author investigates the complexities of productivity and precariousness in activism, noting that \"navigating economic pressures is essential for effective social movements\" [14].\n- The chapter \"Kontaminationen nutzen, Kollaborationen eingehen\" highlights strategies for leveraging collaborations within social movements, emphasizing that \"collaborations enhance the impact of social movements significantly\" [19].\n- Rigamonti's \"(Un-)Ruhig bleiben\" discusses the importance of maintaining composure in turbulent times, contributing to the understanding of activists' strategies in social movements [24].\n- Lastly, \"Experimentelle Zukunftsszenarien - europäische »Flüchtlingsfrage« und demokratische Gesellschaft\" addresses the challenges posed by the European refugee question, advocating for \"innovative approaches essential for addressing migration issues\" [30].\n\n### Aesthetics and Politics in Activism\n\nThe relationship between aesthetics and politics in activism is a dynamic interplay that shapes social movements and collective actions. Various studies highlight how aesthetic expressions can influence political discourse, while creative collaborations can foster new forms of engagement and productivity in activism. Understanding these connections is crucial for analyzing contemporary societal changes and the role of art in political contexts.\n\n- Rigamonti (2023) discusses the potential of \"collective experimentation\" in reshaping social movements, emphasizing that \"creative collaboration is essential in political contexts\" [11].\n- In her exploration of aesthetics, Rigamonti (2023) highlights its significant role in shaping social dynamics, asserting that \"the interplay between art and activism is vital for understanding protests\" [17].\n- This chapter by Rigamonti (2023) employs ethnographic methods to reveal the intricate ties between artistic expression and political activism, underscoring the importance of these dynamics in contemporary society [22].\n- Rigamonti (2023) examines the complex relationship between politics and aesthetics, noting that \"aesthetic expressions can significantly influence political discourse\" [29].\n\n### Sustainable Futures and Energy Solutions\n\nThe theme of Sustainable Futures and Energy Solutions emphasizes innovative approaches to energy management and community engagement in the face of climate change. By integrating more-than-human elements and fostering smart renewable energy communities, these studies highlight pathways toward sustainable energy practices that are both technologically advanced and socially inclusive. \n\n- The aesthetics of more-than-human design: speculative energy briefs for the Chthulucene [3]: This paper presents design briefs that incorporate more-than-human elements in energy-demand reduction, advocating for \"novel forms of ‘sense making’\" to enhance energy relations. \n- Smart Renewable Energy Communities - Existing and Future Prospects [4]: This study outlines the current and future potential of Smart Renewable Energy Communities, emphasizing their crucial role in sustainable energy strategies and the importance of technology integration for community engagement.\n\n### Emotional Responses and Public Perception\n\nEmotional responses play a significant role in shaping public perception, as evidenced by various studies. For instance, the exploration of London's fatbergs reveals how feelings of disgust and pride influence views on urban infrastructure [2]. Similarly, the dynamics of social movements highlight how confrontation and emotional engagement can accelerate public activism [12].\n\n- In \"London’s fatbergs and affective infrastructuring,\" Mike Michael [2] discusses how emotional reactions like disgust and pride affect public perceptions of London's sewer system, introducing the concept of 'affective infrastructuring.'\n- Nora Rigamonti's chapter \"Zukunftsszenario II: Konfrontation, Dekomposition und situative Akzeleration\" [12] emphasizes the evolving dynamics of social movements, noting that confrontation is a crucial strategy for activists in shaping public sentiment.\n\n### Research Methodologies and Theoretical Frameworks\n\nResearch methodologies and theoretical frameworks play a crucial role in shaping the discourse around social movements and activism. Various approaches, such as speculative research and ecological frameworks, highlight the interconnectedness of research elements and their implications for understanding contemporary issues. This section draws on diverse perspectives to illustrate how these methodologies can expand the boundaries of academic inquiry.\n\n- **[8] Speculative Research**: This paper discusses a constructivist approach that emphasizes \"co-becoming\" in research, encouraging the exploration of alternative materials to reframe questions and expand data analysis possibilities. \n- **[21] 3.1 »Drawing things together«: Ökologien des Forschens, Denkens und Schreibens**: Nora Rigamonti explores the interconnected ecologies of research, thought, and writing, emphasizing their influence on social movements and the importance of understanding these dynamics.\n- **[31] 1.3 Forschungslücke, forschungsleitende Fragen und Ziel der Arbeit**: This chapter identifies research gaps in social movements, outlining guiding questions and objectives to enhance scholarly discourse in the field.\n\n**Peripheral & emerging (coverage addendum)**\n\n- Nora Rigamonti explores the search for certainty and uncertainty in contemporary contexts in her chapter published on September 6, 2023 [9].  \n- The chapter discusses the European \"refugee question\" through experimental approaches, highlighting complexities and societal implications [13].  \n- An index of illustrations is provided to support the visual representation of concepts discussed in the book [15].  \n- Rigamonti offers a conceptualization of politics, examining its definitions and implications within social movements [16].  \n- The chapter presents an ethnographic approach to political and aesthetic practices in action, emphasizing their interconnectedness [18].  \n- Acknowledgments are made to contributors and supporters of the work, highlighting collaborative efforts [20].  \n- The search for suitable concepts is discussed, focusing on theoretical approaches to understanding social movements [23].  \n- Rigamonti addresses the need to navigate ambivalences and process uncertainties in contemporary political contexts [25].  \n- An overview of the work is provided, summarizing key themes and objectives of the research [26].  \n- The chapter investigates inventive and interventive democracy, questioning its role in current political discourse [27].  \n- The European \"refugee question\" is analyzed alongside societal controversies, proposing alternative solutions at the intersection of politics and aesthetics [28].  \n- Rigamonti reflects on the relationship between politics and aesthetics, offering insights into their evolving dynamics [29].  \n- Experimental future scenarios related to the European \"refugee question\" are presented, exploring potential pathways [30].  \n- The chapter identifies research gaps and formulates guiding questions to direct future inquiries [31].  \n- An abstract summarizes the key findings and contributions of the work, providing a concise overview [32].  \n- The table of contents outlines the structure and key topics covered in the book [33].  \n- Frontmatter introduces the book's themes and sets the stage for the discussions to follow [34].\n\n## 5.
