This review explores innovative advancements in agriculture and food technology, from urban farming (e.g., vertical farming, aquaponics, and hydroponics) to regenerative agriculture and agroforestry practices that enhance soil health and biodiversity. We also examine food production in extreme environments, including desert agriculture and space agriculture, as well as advances in biotechnology, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology, that enable improved crop yields and nutrition. The transformative role of AI in precision farming, predictive analytics, and water management is highlighted, as well as the importance of bioproducts and eco-friendly innovations. Finally, we discuss the vital role of policy, regulation, and community-driven approaches in shaping a resilient global food system. Through the integration of technology with sustainable practices, this review aims to inspire research into solutions that ensure future food security while preserving our planet.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":212,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
