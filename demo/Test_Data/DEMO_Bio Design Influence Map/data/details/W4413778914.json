The discussion departs from the slogans “science must be defended” and “science must fall” by, first, articulating the idea that science is under attack by an anti-intellectualist populism, and second, discussing the counternarrative that institutionalized science has mostly served capitalist and colonial exploitation and is therefore deeply implicated in the production of global challenges and inequalities. Both narratives convey relevant insights about the interface of science and society. Rather than choosing between them, this chapter positions transformative transdisciplinarity as a case for rethinking the roles of science in society. Science is indeed indispensable for addressing global challenges, but its ability to contribute to more equitable outcomes depends on systemic change in academia. Transformative (philosophy of) science, therefore, needs to turn transformative ambitions on itself by articulating disruptive visions of academic research and its relations to society.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":0},"references":560,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
