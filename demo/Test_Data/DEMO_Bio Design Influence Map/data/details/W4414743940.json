However, a closer examination reveals a rich and complex web of interplay between the two, where scientific inquiry and artistic creativity converge to explore and interpret the natural world. In this article, we dig into the flourishing field of microbial art, with a particular focus on the utilisation of extremophilic microorganisms – organisms that thrive in conditions once deemed uninhabitable – as both objects and subjects in contemporary artistic practices. Tracing the lineage from early intersections between these two fields to modern pioneers, we highlight how microorganisms have transitioned from subjects of scientific study to integral components of artistic creation. Through case studies, we illustrated how the unique properties of extremophiles – such as their pigmentation, resilience, and metabolic capabilities – offer novel avenues for artistic exploration. Furthermore, we emphasised the reciprocal benefits of interdisciplinary collaborations between artists and scientists. In an era marked by environmental challenges and the proliferation of misinformation, the fusion of art and science emerges as a compelling strategy to promote public understanding and appreciation of complex scientific phenomena, serving also as potent tools for science communication and outreach.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":42,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
