The foundations of such performance include its robust redox metabolism, ability to tolerate a wide range of physicochemical stresses, rapid growth, versatile metabolism, nonpathogenic nature, and the availability of molecular tools for advanced genetic programming. These attributes have been leveraged for hosting engineered pathways for production of valuable chemicals or degradation/valorization of environmental pollutants. This has in turn pushed the boundaries of conventional enzymology toward previously unexplored reactions in nature. Furthermore, modifications to the physical properties of the cells have been made to enhance their catalytic performance. These advancements establish P. putida as bona fide chassis for synthetic biology, on par with more traditional metabolic engineering platforms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":16,"cited_by_count":48},"references":75,"networkCitations":16,"seed":false}
