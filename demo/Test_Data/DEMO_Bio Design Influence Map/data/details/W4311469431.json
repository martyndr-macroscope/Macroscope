Much has been written about the eugenic alarm period (1900–1925), and this chapter attempts to provide a brief overview of the more important aspects of the period. Importantly, while many tend to exploit eugenics for certain political or ideological ends, interest in eugenics during the alarm period cut across the sociopolitical landscape. The specific eugenic policies (sterilization, immigration control, institutionalization, etc.) enacted in the United States are discussed, along with the movement’s focus on persons with feeble-mindedness. Finally, the relationship between policies in the United States and Nazi Germany will be explored, along with the impact of Nazi eugenic policies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":214,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
