However, these guidelines face limitations as the abstract nature of principles makes it difficult to translate them into practice and risks interpretations that allow for ethics-washing. Context sensitive frameworks, such as ELSA, RRI and VSD, are more attuned to the context-specificity required in AI development. However, these frameworks have faced limited uptake. Building on the tradition of these frameworks, we are developing a pragmatist approach named ELSA-by-design. We reflect on the implementation of this approach in the ELSA Lab Poverty & Debt, discussing the challenges we have faced and highlighting the opportunities of an iterative, experimental approach to ethics.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":75,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
