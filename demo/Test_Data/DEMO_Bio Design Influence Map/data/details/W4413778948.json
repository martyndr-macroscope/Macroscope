The first section explores methodologies of knowledge production through the triad of paternalism, diversity, and decolonization. Transdisciplinarity challenges paternalistic modes of knowledge production and points toward the importance of epistemic diversity. While the move from epistemic diversity to epistemic decolonization highlights tensions beyond a harmonious picture of “letting a thousand epistemologies bloom,” it also raises new questions about the very possibility of constructive collaboration and dialogue in the face of inequality and oppression. The second section outlines a “partial overlap” approach to navigating this complex landscape. On the one hand, the approach emphasizes overlaps between epistemologies, ontologies, and value systems that provide common ground for intercultural dialogue and transdisciplinary collaboration. On the other hand, these overlaps always remain partial and therefore point toward the need for serious engagement with disagreements and tensions between knowledge systems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":560,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
