As radical innovations, they may trigger profound social and economic changes. Despite the many benefits of alternative meats, such as environmental sustainability, animal welfare, human health and food safety, some unintended consequences remain unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we studied the potential impact of the meat production system transition on jobs. Using a survey, we compared opinions regarding the impact on jobs in Brazil, the United States and Europe, according to alternative protein experts. Our results showed the potential of plant-based and cultivated meat production to create new and higher-skilled jobs. The data analysis also suggested that the impact of novel food production systems on jobs in conventional meat production may be different for each stage of the value chain. In particular, the results showed a pressure point on animal farmers, who may be most affected in a fast transition scenario. Considering the studied geographical contexts, Brazilian professionals were more optimistic about the potential of plant-based and cultivated meat production to create new jobs. Our findings may provide new insights for the development of policies, measures and strategies that promote job creation, skills and income in view of the ongoing transition.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":54},"references":65,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
