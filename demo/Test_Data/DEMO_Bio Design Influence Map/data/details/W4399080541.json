The contributions to this volume introduce contemporary research on the digitization and »datafication« of products, exploring topics like user experience, artificial intelligence, and virtual environments in design. Coming from varied backgrounds in product design, interaction design, service design, game design, architecture, and graphic design, they emphasize that digital transformation is not just a technical process, but also a social and learning process that fundamentally changes the way we understand information.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":114,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
