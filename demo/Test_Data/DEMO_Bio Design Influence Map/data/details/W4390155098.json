Citizen engagement (CE) plays an essential role in this process, particularly in sustaining the continuity of CS projects. However, the study of engagement with citizen science projects predominantly concentrates on observable behavioural aspects, often overlooking its multiple dimensions. In this study, we use marketing-related concepts and service-dominant logic to bridge the gaps in conceptualizing engagement while simultaneously integrating it with related concepts. Using a popular online biodiversity monitoring platform (BioDiversity4All) as a case study, we analyse data from semi-structured interviews and quantitative data to demonstrate the multidimensionality of citizen engagement, in which cognitive, affective, behavioural and social dimensions have equally relevant roles. We also identify both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for engaging with CS projects, the resources integrated into the platform, and the co-created value. Based on our findings, we propose a comprehensive model of citizen engagement with citizen science-based projects that illustrates its multidimensionality, motivational drivers, and its impact on the process of value co-creation. We also discuss on how citizen science can impact at the micro, meso and macro levels through citizen engagement, and its potential to endure long-lasting societal changes. Overall, our results identify keys aspects that can be useful to increase the success of CS initiatives, while providing cues to improve recruiting of participants and maintain long-term engagement.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":76,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
