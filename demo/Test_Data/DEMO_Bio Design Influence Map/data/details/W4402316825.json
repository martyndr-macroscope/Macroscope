Factors such as design methods, component reuse, or digital fabrication empower prosumer designers to realize their ideas. Although there are cases of bioinspired products manufactured by prosumers, the interactions between bioinspired design methods in the prosumer field have not been addressed from an academic point of view. This article presents a case that combines bioinspired design methods with prosumer characteristics from the perspective of a designer who uses biological research results whilst acting as a prosumer. The proposal is to see whether working on a small scale, without the need for biomimetics experts, and independently, as a prosumer, is feasible and valuable. As a result, a bicycle flashlight is designed with a microgenerator bioinspired by the geometry of samara seeds, and is tested in a wind tunnel. This case shows that the integration of a bioinspired design in prosumer contexts poses unique challenges and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Furthermore, the application of a bioinspired approach in this case has not only provided a certain level of novelty to the final product, but has also improved its efficiency and reduced its financial expenditure.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":43,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
