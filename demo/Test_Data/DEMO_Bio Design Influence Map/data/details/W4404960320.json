To combine both characteristics, the forming process itself, once scaled up, needs to be based on efficient material moulding strategies. Based on case studies of adaptive forming techniques derived from the composite industry and concrete casting, two approaches for the mass production of customised NFRP profiles are proposed. Both processes are based on foam from recycled PET, which is used as either a removable mould or a stay-in-place (SIP) core. Once the textile reinforcement is placed on a mould, either by helical winding of natural fibre prepregs or in the form of mass-produced textile preforms, its elastic properties allow for the free-forming of the composite profile before the resin is fully cured. This paper investigates the range of deformations that it is possible to achieve by each method and describes the realisation of a small structural demonstrator, in the form of a stool, through the helical winding of a flax prepreg on a SIP core.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
