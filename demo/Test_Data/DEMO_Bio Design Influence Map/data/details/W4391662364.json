This process, often referred to as microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP), is primarily exploited in an engineering context for soil stabilisation and the repair of concrete structures. MICP represents an emerging area of research in architecture and design. In this paper, we discuss the appropriation of MICP on Papier Plume, a foam made of paper waste used in the context of ImpressioVivo: a design-led research project exploring the conception and fabrication of 3D-printed and bacterially induced bio-sourced materials for a circular design framework. In the light of a previous study based on two strategies of calcification: (1) direct inoculation (2) spraying, we – a team of two designers and a microbiologist – discuss the relevance of an immersion strategy applied to the dry paper foam substrate. By doing so, we reflect on the relevance of MICP as a material design process underpinned by sustainable and circularity concerns, from a design perspective, but also into an attempt to embrace the perspective of the bacteria supporting these experiments; namely Sporosarcina pasteurii.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":24,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
