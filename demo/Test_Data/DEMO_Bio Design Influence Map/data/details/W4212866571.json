Nowadays, agricultural practices are done by statistical and quantitative approaches. It is important to protect the data which are collected in the agricultural sector. Blockchain is one of the promising technologies that are used for the data encryption. Blockchain is used to store the transaction data. A huge amount of data is stored in IPFS, which ensures scalability and data confidentiality. It also ensures data privacy with the data sharing mechanism. The data collected from the agricultural sectors like moisture content of the soil, temperature, and crop status that are obtained from the IoT sensors on the agricultural land, other details such as previous year agricultural records, details of the agricultural land, yield, logistics, and so on are passed to the blockchain and so that the data cannot be used for malpractices. These data are helpful for the farmers to cultivate the crops according to their land conditions. This data can also be analyzed so that the farmer can get an estimate from the government and insurance organizations to meet his needs. Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is used for secure storage of this large quantity of information. This chapter presents a completely secure blockchain-based framework for smart farming using IoT sensors and a farmer support system to meet certain necessities of the farmer.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
