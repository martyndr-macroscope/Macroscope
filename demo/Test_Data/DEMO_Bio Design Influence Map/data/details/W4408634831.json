Here, we developed Escherichia coli strains to produce 2,3-butanediol and acetoin (collectively referred to as diols) using acetate as the sole carbon source by stepwise metabolic engineering. When tested in fed-batch experiments, the strain overexpressing the entire acetate utilization pathway was found to consume acetate at a 15% faster rate (0.78 ± 0.05 g/g/h) and to produce a 35% higher diol titer (1.16 ± 0.01 g/L) than the baseline diols-producing strain. Moreover, singularly overexpressing the genes encoding alternative acetate uptake pathways as well as alternative isoforms of genes in the malate-to-pyruvate pathway unveiled that leveraging ackA-pta and maeA is more effective in enhancing acetate consumption and diols production, compared to acs and maeB. Finally, the increased substrate consumption rate and diol production obtained in flask-based experiments were confirmed in bench-scale bioreactors operated in fed-batch mode. Consequently, the highest titer of 1.56 g/L achieved in this configuration increased by over 30% compared to the only other similar effort carried out so far.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":98,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
