A social lab organized within the European project NewHoRRIzon explored ways to stimulate further integration of RRI principles (public engagement, open access, gender, ethics, science education) in the nuclear research. Under the title “Nuclear Dating”, a pilot action was designed in this lab with the aim of creating awareness of RRI among Early Career Researchers, providing a venue for experimenting interdisciplinary collaborations and stimulating their reflexivity to the wider social, ethical, and environmental issues surrounding their research. Through a joint effort of organizers and participants, this paper shares insights from this first of a kind event in the nuclear R&amp;D landscape.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
