It is formed by periplasmic oxidation of fructose by fructose dehydrogenase (Fdh) of Gluconobacter japonicus , a membrane‐bound three‐subunit enzyme containing FAD and three haemes c as prosthetic groups. This study aimed at establishing Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as a new cell factory for 5‐KF production, as this host offers a number of advantages compared with the established host Gluconobacter oxydans . Genomic expression of the fdhSCL genes from G. japonicus enabled synthesis of functional Fdh in P . putida and successful oxidation of fructose to 5‐KF. In a batch fermentation, 129 g l −1 5‐KF were formed from 150 g l −1 fructose within 23 h, corresponding to a space‐time yield of 5.6 g l −1 h −1 . Besides fructose, also sucrose could be used as substrate for 5‐KF production by plasmid‐based expression of the invertase gene inv1417 from G. japonicus . In a bioreactor cultivation with pulsed sucrose feeding, 144 g 5‐KF were produced from 358 g sucrose within 48 h. These results demonstrate that P. putida is an attractive host for 5‐KF production.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":7},"references":63,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
