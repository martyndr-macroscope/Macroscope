Although seemingly distant from architecture, biology is currently a scientific field that fits into design practices that have evolved and shifted towards a new hybrid framework. Architecture is a complex negotiated cultural practice that encompasses all aesthetic, technical, economic, and political issues of social production itself. For architects, the integration of academic knowledge and design practice can be a difficult activity to define, but it can be the intellectual fuel that drives innovation and growth in architectural practice. The relationship and connection between architecture and nature have generated many questions, criticisms, and solutions. Today, a new form of design was introduced a few years ago, forcing the modern man to be inspired by decades of natural processes, but whose true potential has only recently been revealed.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":6,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
