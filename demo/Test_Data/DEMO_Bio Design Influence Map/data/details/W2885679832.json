Rather ethics must approach the relationship between principles and practical moral challenges as a kind of reflective equilibrium. Against this background, applied ethics is not merely the application of principles to practice but a process in which practical experiences reciprocally influence the content and interpretation of ethical principles. Ethical theory learns from moral practice. Given that the interventions of biotechnology and genetic engineering principally affect the existence of nonhuman animals, ethics not only addresses questions relating to human health or social cooperation but takes a particularly fundamental interest in the ever-changing normative relationship between humans and animals as well as humans and nature. Therefore in this paper the analysis of the ethical challenges posed by biotechnology applied on animals reveals several problem areas that must be considered in developing ethical criteria for the investigation of biogenetic activities. Firstly, the paper will address the basic relationship of humankind and its technologies to nature (Chap. 1 ) in addition to the development of relevant evaluative criteria in environmental ethics and the ethics of nature (Chap. 2 ). The latter aid in the normative evaluation of technologies when weighing up which ends and means can be considered justified in relation to the goods a society recognises (Chap. 3 ). Against the background of biotechnological contributions to food production, the anthropological question as to what role food plays in a current culture and lifestyle—and what kind of change that culture and lifestyle might admit—will be analysed (Chap. 4 ). Yet the evaluation of biotechnology, to the extent that it is used on animals, covers more than just the well-being of humans and society; transgenic animals also pose a great challenge to animal protection and welfare (Chap. 5 ). Finally the paper discusses that a society dealing with new technologies must constantly consider what form risk assessment should take and what kind of tolerance for environmental, health, and economic risks that implies (Chap. 6 ). Processes that advance sustainability, justice, food quality, and animal welfare alike should be placed at the centre of modern agriculture and food production. From an ethical perspective, the gene technological and biotechnological production of animals must be measured according to the extent of its contribution to these complex and highly relevant goals.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":44,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
