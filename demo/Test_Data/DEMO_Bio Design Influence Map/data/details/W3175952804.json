In recent years extensive investigation and research studies have been dedicated to explore methods of production and processing as well as to find potential applications for mycelium-bound composite materials. However, application of this novel biocomposite within the construction industry has been limited to only small-scale prototypes and exhibition installations. The problems with low mechanical properties, high water absorption and lack of standard methods for production and testing of mycelium-bound composite materials remain as main challenges that need to be addressed when used as non-structural or semi-structural elements. This short review aims to display the potential of mycelium-bound composite materials for their use within the construction sector in the form of thermal and acoustic insulation as well as replacement for drywalls and tiles. This review summarizes the main available information with regards to the properties of mycelium-bound composites that have been used in construction sector while suggesting the direction for the future research and development on these biocomposites for their applications within the construction industry.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":68},"references":53,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
