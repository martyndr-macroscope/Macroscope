Synthetic biological designs aim to achieve specific biological behavior, which can be exploited for biotechnological, medical and industrial purposes. In addition, mimicking natural systems using well-characterized biological parts also provides powerful experimental systems to study evolution at the molecular and systems level. A strength of synthetic biology is to go beyond nature’s toolkit, to test alternative versions and to study a particular biological system and its phenotype in isolation and in a quantitative manner. Here, we review recent work that implemented synthetic systems, ranging from simple regulatory circuits, rewired cellular networks to artificial genomes and viruses, to study fundamental evolutionary concepts. In particular, engineering, perturbing or subjecting these synthetic systems to experimental laboratory evolution provides a mechanistic understanding on important evolutionary questions, such as: Why did particular regulatory networks topologies evolve and not others? What happens if we rewire regulatory networks? Could an expanded genetic code provide an evolutionary advantage? How important is the structure of genome and number of chromosomes? Although the field of evolutionary synthetic biology is still in its teens, further advances in synthetic biology provide exciting technologies and novel systems that promise to yield fundamental insights into evolutionary principles in the near future.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":9},"references":145,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
