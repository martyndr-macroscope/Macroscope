Nevertheless, it is usually challenging to achieve ideal industrial yields due to low production rate and poor toxicity tolerance. Evolution is a constant mutation and adaptation process used to improve strain performance. Generally speaking, the synthesis of natural products in microbes is often intricate, involving multiple enzymes or multiple pathways. Individual evolution of a certain enzyme often fails to achieve the desired results, and may lead to new rate-limiting nodes that affect the growth of microbes. Therefore, it is inevitable to evolve the biosynthetic pathways or the whole genome. Here, we reviewed the pathway-level evolution including multi-enzyme evolution, regulatory elements engineering, and computer-aided engineering, as well as the genome-level evolution based on several tools, such as genome shuffling and CRISPR/Cas systems. Finally, we also discussed the major challenges faced by in vivo evolution strategies and proposed some potential solutions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":120,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
