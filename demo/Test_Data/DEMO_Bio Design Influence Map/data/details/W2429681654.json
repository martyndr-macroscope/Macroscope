Troubling from a communications perspective, however, is the tendency in framing the science to hold mothers almost uniquely culpable for their offspring’s later disease risk. The purpose of this article is to add to the conversation about avoiding this unintended outcome by (1) discussing the importance of cognitive processing and issue frames, (2) describing framing challenges associated with communicating about developmental origins of health and disease and offering principles to address them, and (3) providing examples of conceptual metaphors that may be helpful in telling this complex and contextual story for public health.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":34},"references":34,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
