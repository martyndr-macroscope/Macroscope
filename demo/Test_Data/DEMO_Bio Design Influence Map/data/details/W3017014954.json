Proving to be easier said than done, the operationalization of the social scientific concept of culture for clinical practice has been fraught with implementation difficulties—from clinician buy-in to stereotyping. I draw upon ethnographic data to detail how an interdisciplinary group of social scientists and clinicians work to translate a theoretically-complex, reflexive, and social-justice-oriented conceptualization of culture into a clinical intervention tool. As opposed to previous accounts of interdisciplinary collaboration that describe social science being ignored, marginalized, or non-commodifiable, I show how this group makes the anthropological concept of culture both clinically and commercially relevant and the importance of clinicians-as-consumers in the translational process.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":8},"references":44,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
