Therefore, this paper combines the elements of the scene and integrates the Internet of Things smart city to conduct public art planning and design research. Moreover, based on the multimedia Internet of Things environment, this paper analyzes the effects of virtual reality technology in urban public art planning and design and gives the overall optimization ideas for the organization and rendering of VR scene data. Then, this paper studies the organization and rendering optimization methods of the terrain scene model and the scene model, respectively. The experimental research results show that the smart city public art planning and design system under the multimedia Internet of Things environment designed in this paper has a good smart city public art planning and design effect.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":3},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
