With increased worries about environmental deterioration, the building sector is increasingly focusing on long-term solutions. This research looks into a variety of materials, including bamboo, engineered wood products, recycled composites, and optimal concrete mixtures. The study underlines the importance of compressive, tensile, and flexural strengths, which are a basic feature for structural integrity. The study also gives useful insights into their practical applicability in real-world building projects by assessing the flexural strength of various materials. Furthermore, the study examines the environmental effect of these materials, taking into account characteristics such as renewability, recyclability, and energy efficiency. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the fundamental properties of selected materials as part of the investigations. The study emphasizes the ecological advantages of adopting these sustainable alternatives through life cycle assessments and comparative studies. The research output can be served as a thorough reference for architects, engineers, and policymakers, providing a complete knowledge of sustainable building materials and their critical role in developing a greener, more resilient built environment.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":50},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
