The objective of this study was to observe scent profiles of S. violaceruber on different fibres: cotton, acrylic, linen, and merino wool; and analyse the potential impact of fibre properties on scent profile, intensity, and duration. In doing so, the research suggests potential opportunities to curate living scents through textiles and the generation of sensory textile-bacterial hybrids. Interdisciplinary methods were applied to compare changes in the present volatile compounds and identify fibres and fabrication processes most suitable for creating a living textile. The paper reports on the development of textile samples that are infused with S. violaceruber and observed for their subjective scent, as well as the volatile compounds, which were analysed via gas chromatography. The findings of this study confirmed the presence and development of bacterial scents on textiles during bacterial growth. The scents identified included earthy, soil-like, floral, jasmine, and fruity notes, offering potential for further exploration in fibre and yarn selection, as well as the structural design of the textile. This research contributes to the field of biotextiles by examining the influence of textile fibres and knitted textiles on bacterial volatile compounds. It establishes a platform for investigating how different fibres and structural factors influence the bacterial scent profile. It also provides valuable insights for the future development of living sensory textiles and their integration into various applications.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":1},"references":35,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
