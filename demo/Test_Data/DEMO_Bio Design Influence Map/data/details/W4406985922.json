As such, this study aimed to determine the dynamic role of NbSs in shaping the sustainability of South Africaâ€™s built environment. Using a quantitative approach, the data were collected via a questionnaire survey, which targeted built environment professionals. Data analysis involved reliability testing, confirmatory factor analysis, and Spearman rank order correlation. The survey showed that green roofs, rainwater harvesting, cool roofing and pavements, as well as living walls, have received above-average attention in the country, while agricultural byproducts from concrete construction, bioswales, rain gardens, and algae-based materials are yet to be explored in the delivery of green buildings and sustainable urban areas. Overall, deploying NbSs promises positive environmental, societal, and economic impacts. The findings emphasize the need for stronger policies and regulations that promote the adoption of underutilized NbSs within the South African built environment. Theoretically, this study contributes to the existing discourse on sustainable development in South Africa. As the nation grapples with diverse environmental and social issues, this study becomes timely, as it provides crucial insights into how NbSs can address some of these challenges.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":1},"references":47,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
