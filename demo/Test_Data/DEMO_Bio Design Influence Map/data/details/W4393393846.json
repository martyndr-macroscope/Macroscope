Using the approach, Identify-Invent-Implement, the biodesigners identify and unravel the unmet needs of society in the field of healthcare, environment, and architecture sectors by developing novel products and improving technologies with the incorporation of design into it. With evolving technology, biodesign has created an impact globally in the ecology by preventing the ecological imbalance, creating an impact on the psychological behaviour of humans by boosting their confidence and thus influencing oneâ€™s behaviour. Biodesign crossed various technological barriers by developing devices such as hearing, and vision aids, prosthetics, implants, and eco-friendly cements and also used microorganisms to enhance the quality of the bricks. Biodesign has crossed the limits of earth curvature and reached space by innovation like future space colonization and protecting indigenous species.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":31,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
