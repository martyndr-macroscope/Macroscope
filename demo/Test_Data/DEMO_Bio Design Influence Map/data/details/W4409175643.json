This paradigm shift has not only transformed the physical aspects of urban environments but has also redefined the relationship between architecture, end-users, and the built environment. Advancements in technology paved the way for a revolutionary approach to architecture, that involves responsiveness and adaptability to the environment, leading to the spread of the so-called Smart Architecture, buildings able to fit in with their ever-changing surroundings. Smart buildings present, in general terms, a global enhancement of their performance features, having the potential to impact the built environment in a new interacting, and engaging way, making architecture more accessible, performant, and user-friendly. This paper summarizes the results of a study aimed at identifying and classifying a sample of applications of advanced materials and technologies in the context of building envelopes, considered representative of relevant Smart Architecture solutions. The categorization will be done according to four categories: biomimicry, smart materials, kinetic elements, and 3D printed solutions. This results in a database of Smart Architecture case studies that collects brief details of each application and working principles, together with data regarding design practice, technology readiness, and economic aspects, among others.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
