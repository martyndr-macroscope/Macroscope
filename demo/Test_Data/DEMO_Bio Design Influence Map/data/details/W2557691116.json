These developments present an opportunity to develop a common agenda of research. This chapter reports on two recent exercises that brought together socio-technical integration scholars and practitioners in order to scope out and reflect upon what such an agenda might entail. After summarising a handful of recurrent methodological, conceptual and normative themes that were articulated in both exercises, it briefly situates these within the literature and identifies some ‘next steps’ for continued agenda-building.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":4},"references":36,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
