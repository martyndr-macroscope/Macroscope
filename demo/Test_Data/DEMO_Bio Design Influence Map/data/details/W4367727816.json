Most of the South Florida region was a subtropical wetland until just 120 years ago. In the land natives called Pa-hay-Okee (grassy river), we build a 20th-century industrial sprawl and completely transformed the ecology of the region by altering significant parts of the wild into rural. This is not an isolated story for South Florida. Today more than 50% of living organisms, plants, and ecological systems in the world are determined by human industrialization.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":2,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
