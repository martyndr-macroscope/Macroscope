Collaborations between these two communities are frequently called for to enhance the ethical conduct of genomics research. Yet, little has been done to qualitatively compare genome scientists' and ELSI scholars' perspectives on collaborations with each other and the factors that may affect these collaborations.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":33,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
