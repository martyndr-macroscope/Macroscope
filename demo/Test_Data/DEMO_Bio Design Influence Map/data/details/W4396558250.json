Before applying NBS, acquiring stakeholders' viewpoints, e.g., city councils, local governments, and academia, contributes to the successful application and thus to mitigation of global challenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, water, and food scarcity. The present study explores how stakeholders across Europe view the role of NBS in urban planning. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns, themes, and concepts within interview transcripts gathered through semi-structured interviews held in Budapest, Cordoba, Ljubljana, Reykjavik, Vienna, and Zurich. The study resulted in 107 distinctive codes categorized into NBS benefits, challenges, opportunities, NBS actors, and regulations. The frequency of codes (Fr) mentioned by the interviewees showed that NBS benefit cooperation (Fr=125) between individuals, while the most challenging issue obstructing NBS implementation was the lack of NBS knowledge (Fr=93). The need for green areas (Fr=42) was identified as an opportunity that could give rise to NBS applications. This study also provides practical recommendations to overcome some barriers when implementing NBS.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":19},"references":76,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
