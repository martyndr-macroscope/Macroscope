First, the louver system can be configured as either vertical or horizontal by modularizing and rotating its slats. A solar-tracking mechanism for single-axis louver control was also developed and proven effective. Second, for optimal energy-saving performance, the louver operation must respond to external environmental conditions. Its control should account for PV power generation and building energy demands for heating, cooling, and lighting to maintain comfortable indoor and outdoor environments. Third, the proposed louver system achieved a building energy reduction of 4.7â€“8.8% compared to conventional fixed technologies. However, in winter, the louver may obstruct solar gains, potentially diminishing its effectiveness in reducing energy consumption. While this study demonstrates the potential of the proposed louver technology for energy efficiency, it is limited by the scope of environmental and operational conditions considered in the performance evaluation. Further studies under diverse climatic scenarios are necessary to substantiate its broader applicability.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":56,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
