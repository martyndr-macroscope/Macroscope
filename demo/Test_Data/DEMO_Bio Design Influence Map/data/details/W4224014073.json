Silk fibroin is a kind of natural polymer material with unique properties. It can be used as a carrier material to load Chinese medicine monomers to prepare novel drug delivery systems that significantly affect treating diseases without toxic and side effects. However, there is still a lack of a review on silk fibroin as a carrier material to load Chinese medicine monomers to explore and analyze the current research results and progress. Here, our article focuses on the in-depth excavation and analysis of the recent research on novel drug delivery systems prepared by silk fibroin and TCM monomers. Besides, the characteristics, existing problems, and prospects of silk fibroin are discussed and explained. It is hoped that this research can provide a reference and basis for the modernization of TCM, the design of novel drug delivery systems, the research and development of new drugs in the future, and contribute to the innovation of silk protein.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":52,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
