Constructive approaches such as Technology Assessment (TA), Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), or lately, “Open Science, Open Innovation, Open to the World”, attempt to integrate ethical and social considerations into the pathways of progress from the roots upwards. Scientists, as important enactors in scientific progress and technological innovation, are asked to participate in the discourse on ethical and social implications of their work, but find it challenging to define their role in it. This comment attempts to motivate scientists to be “responsible” and “engaged” by shedding light on their expected contributions to making constructive S&amp;T discourse more sustainable.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":12},"references":42,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
