It has the potential to contribute to solving major global challenges in a multitude of areas, from healthcare to sustainability. While the engineering biology landscape is robust and well-established in certain countries, the ecosystem and infrastructure for genetic engineering in other countries, including Slovakia, are underdeveloped. Consequently, such countries are missing the major economic and social benefits that the practical applications of the rational design of biological systems may provide. In this work, we briefly assess the status of the synthetic biology landscape in Slovakia in different areas, including research efforts, industrial participation, governmental policy, and the educational landscape. We describe the major challenges that the Slovak synthetic biology sector faces and propose a strategy that academics, policymakers, and industry could take to activate the proliferation of the Slovak synthetic biology ecosystem.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":4},"references":44,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
