Historically, decisions around forest management, including the application of novel approaches, have been driven by the interests of particular groups and informed by a narrow range of knowledge inputs. Drawing on our program of social science research and that of others, we demonstrate: (a) the need to expand the range of groups consulted in climate‐adaptive forest management; (b) the necessity to incorporate a broader range of knowledge inputs; and (c) the development and application of deliberative approaches that facilitate both. Synthesis . We identify a novel deliberative agenda for understanding the societal aspects and implications of plant translocation research and practice, and make recommendations for mixed socially based research methods that revolve around engaging a diverse set of publics and forms of knowledge in environmental decision‐making and policy‐setting.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":14},"references":56,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
