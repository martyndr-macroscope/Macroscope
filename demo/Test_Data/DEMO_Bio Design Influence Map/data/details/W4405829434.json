While these materials remain in use for several years or decades, growing global populations and aging infrastructure are driving widespread generation of one of the largest and most challenging waste streams to manage. There is growing interest from communities in integrating circular economy (CE) strategies in the context of construction &amp;amp; demolition (C&amp;amp;D) material management. Many approaches for doing so focus on small-scale CE applications like individual products, materials, or projects. However, greater understanding is needed at the city-scale given communitiesâ€™ complex position at the frontlines of local development, resource consumption, and waste management. This study summarizes the development of an evaluative framework for community-based C&amp;amp;D circularity at a city or regional level. The framework expands upon a mixed methods approach called the Circularity Assessment Protocol (CAP), which integrates aspects of urban metabolism, geospatial analysis, and qualitative research methods to examine plastic waste management in communities. To advance convergent CE research, here, we aim to adapt the CAP framework to C&amp;amp;D. We describe our adaptation of the CAP to C&amp;amp;D through a conceptual review describing research, methods, and strategies related to seven elements of a local CE context: C&amp;amp;D Analytics, Building Material and Design, Community, Use, Collection, End-of-Cycle, and C&amp;amp;D Emissions. This work describes a novel yet preliminary conceptualization for developing a baseline understanding of circular C&amp;amp;D material management and a holistic examination of barriers, affordances, and opportunities for improving city-wide circularity.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":90,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
