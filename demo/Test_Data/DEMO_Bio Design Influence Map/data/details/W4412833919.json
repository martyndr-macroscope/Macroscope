Asymmetrical threats generated mainly but not exclusively by non-state entities compelled regional and worldwide forces to reevaluate their main security strategies. Moreover, several state entities that are highly relevant to managing global issues engaged in much more unpredictable behavior than usual. The spectacular technological developments of the last two decades, which seem to evolve in an exponential manner, created new tools for those who aim to alter the geostrategic status quo through hybrid warfare actions. The main goal of our study is to present some preliminary conclusions on the impact that the use of new technologies by hostile foreign forces in electoral processes can have on the institutional architecture that at least in some parts of the globe managed to ensure a stable and secure environment for several decades. These conclusions are drawn through a case study that analyzes the recent annulment of the first round of the Romanian presidential election. Although many details of this event are not yet clarified, at least for public opinion, the available information clearly suggests that hybrid warfare through new technologies is able to create mistrust and sever links that are vital for ensuring stability both at a national and international level. The Romanian case proves that the main objective of interferences in elections is not always that of helping a certain candidate to win but creating chaos.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
