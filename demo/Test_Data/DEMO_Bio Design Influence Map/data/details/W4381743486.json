These by-products are rich in valuable sugars but P. putida is not known to naturally break them down. In this study, the S12 strain was identified to natively grow on sucrose, demonstrating its industrial relevance using sugarcane feedstocks. Cellulase secretion was also engineered in the KT2440 and S12 strains. Directed laboratory evolution may facilitate strains towards growth using cellulose as a sole carbon source. This project paves the way for enhancing P. putida's metabolic capabilities and advances its potential for commercial applications.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":82,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
