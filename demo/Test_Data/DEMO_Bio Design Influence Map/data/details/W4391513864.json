The dynamic world of textiles is undergoing an extraordinary transition, ushering in the age of NGTs. This article discusses the mechanisms, difficulties, present advancements, and potential future opportunities associated with these NGTs. This assessment traverses the domains of nanotechnology, 3D printing, recycling, wearable electronics, machine learning, biomimicry, and energy harvesting while focusing on sustainability, functionality, smart integration, advanced manufacturing techniques, and multifunctionality as major factors. The paper highlights the wonderful prospects of improved performance, sustainability, intelligent textiles, and wearable technologies, highlighting consumerization, personalization, safety, and protection enhancements. Furthermore, a key method for overcoming major challenges is discussed which is to adopt open innovation, which encourages collaboration, knowledge exchange, and the integration of external resources, all of which aid in addressing scalability and mass production, costing, and a lack of modern technologies in the NGTs industry.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":81},"references":115,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
