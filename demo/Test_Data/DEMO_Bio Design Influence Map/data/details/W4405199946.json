The results indicate that Finnish students tend to exhibit a higher willingness to take climate action, particularly at the individual level, which may be influenced by cultural tendencies that emphasize personal autonomy. In contrast, Korean students, while belonging to a society where collective values are often highlighted, demonstrate higher egoistic values. This could be shaped by other cultural dynamics, such as hierarchical structures or the competitive nature of the education system. Additionally, in both countries, interest in science and the perceived value of science positively correlate with the willingness to take climate action, highlighting how nature-focused learning can motivate students in this regard. Finally, cluster analysis reveals that in Finland, biospheric values play a pivotal role in fostering the willingness to take climate action, whereas in Korea, egoistic values are a significant predictor of the willingness to take collective climate action.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":71,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
