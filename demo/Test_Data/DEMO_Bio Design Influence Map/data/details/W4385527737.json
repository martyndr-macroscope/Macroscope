I do this against the backdrop of the Anthropocene which presents us not only with a ‘climate’ of post-truth and political corruption, but also with the so-called climate crisis. In the context of these two broad examinations, I ask what can an artisan-artist-designer do given this problematic context? My reply is to call on ‘speculative design’ by an ‘avant-garde without authority’ to expose the symptoms of the Anthropocene era.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":60,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
