In response, the interdisciplinary framework of Ecosystem Services (ES) has gained prominence in sustainability and resilience agendas. The potential of bio-inspired design (BID) to provide or improve ES in the built environment is investigated in this study. Its originality stems from the attempt to bridge the gap in the literature by examining the relationship between ES and BID in built environments. By focusing on specific ES, establishing evaluation criteria, and analyzing different BID strategies at micro, meso, and macro urban scales, the research highlights the influence of BID on ES. For example, green roofs have a direct, high impact on climate regulation, while sponge cities have a medium impact on climate regulation. This study identifies climate regulation, purification, and energy as the most relevant ES in the built environment due to their integrability, available technologies, and their ability to be executed at various urban scales. The findings are synthesized into a matrix, linking BID methods to ES and assessing ES based on established criteria.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":141,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
