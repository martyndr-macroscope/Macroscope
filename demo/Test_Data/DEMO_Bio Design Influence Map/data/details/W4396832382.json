We posit this capacity can be harnessed in fostering creative unfolding of everyday care practices towards living artefacts. To explore this premise, we designed a cyanobacterial living artefact with air purifying capacity, and invited eight participants to live with and care for it for two weeks. The artefact can be situated in diverse locations within domestic spaces, wherever the participant would consider air purification necessary and certain lighting conditions beneficial for the artefact's vitality. This versatility is supported by the artefact's colour-changing, pliable, adhesive, and suspendable nature. We analysed visual documentation and semi-structured interviews of participants' experiences of the artefact. Our findings suggest distinct roles of materiality for care regarding labour, knowledge, and exploration. We further highlight the intricate design space encompassing openness, temporalities and semantic fitness towards nurturing mutualistic care in human-microbe interactions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":9},"references":67,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
