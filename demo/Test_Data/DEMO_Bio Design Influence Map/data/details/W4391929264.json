However, the same cannot be said for developing countries, particularly in Africa, where the knowledge and awareness of natural solutions are low, and research on their application within the built environment is scant. Using a sciento‐metric and narrative review of published literature, this paper makes a case for research exploration on nature‐based solutions for a sustainable built environment in Africa. The findings revealed an opportunity for significant research contributions on nature‐based solutions in addressing flood risk management, climate change and urban planning, water quality and carbon emission, sustainable development, and green infrastructure and urban development. These areas are the critical focus of past studies explored. Also, the findings offer guidance for further studies to be conducted in less explored areas, such as carbon sequestration, greenhouse gases, energy utilisation, indoor comfort, and numeric models for using nature‐based solutions within the African context. The findings of the study offer an excellent theoretical background to direct researchers and practitioners who seek to attain and promote sustainable built environments through nature‐based solutions, especially in Africa.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":11},"references":75,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
