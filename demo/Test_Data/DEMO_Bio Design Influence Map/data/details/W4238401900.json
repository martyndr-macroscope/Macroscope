The interesting questions, then, appeared to us as not so much how we do more of the same – though that of course has its place – but in how we use what we now know. Hence the three broad questions that the papers in these conference proceedings respond to: How can design research help frame and address the societal problems that face us? How can design research be a creative and active force for rethinking ideas about Design? How can design research shape our lives in more responsible, meaningful, and open ways?","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":382,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
