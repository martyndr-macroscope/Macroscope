And yet, human individuality seems to dissolve into massive data streams. What is the fate of the human subject in the terabyte age? The Human Genome Project already resulted in personalising and depersonalising trends, exemplified by two types of genomes: the anonymised Human Reference Genome versus the personal genomes of genomics celebrities. This ambiguity is radicalised by post-genomics. Life becomes ‘obliterated’: dissolved into letters and symbols (e.g. the nucleotide alphabet), but this is complemented by re-personalising trends. As a case study, I will analyse the Snyderome, involving a prominent geneticist who closely monitored ‘everything’ with the help of precision diagnostics, resulting in a comprehensive (“high coverage”) omics portrait, highly personal and highly impersonal at the same time, captured in massive data sets, setting the stage for a digital panopticon: a molecularised ‘conscience’, the superego of the terabyte age.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":52,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
