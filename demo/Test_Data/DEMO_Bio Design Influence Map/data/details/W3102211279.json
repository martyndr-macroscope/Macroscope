In the designs that adopt this approach, \"nature\" can be considered as a \"data warehouse\" providing various data that can be transferred from nanoscale to mesoscale regarding process, function, material, structure. Within the scope of this study, bibliometric research was carried out in the CumInCAD database to reveal what kind of information and outputs have been achieved through the data/capta taken from nature. In this process, the aim is to discover and understand the conceptual relationships, not only the purpose of the data taken from nature but also the relationships between the data and the patterns. All the data obtained were analysed within the scope of the determined parameters and visuals, including data relations, were prepared. As a result of the study, it can be seen that the bio-informed studies examined in this paper have the potential to open up a wide range of new research in the discipline of architecture. The findings show that the biomimetic approach has set the stage for the scientific and interdisciplinary studies that have the potential to change paradigms in architecture.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":7,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
