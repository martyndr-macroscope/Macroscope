Plant-associated microbiomes offer one avenue for addressing this demand; however, studying these communities and engineering them has remained a challenge due to limited genetic tools and methods. In this work, we detail the development of the Maize Root ToolKit (MRTK); a rapid Modular Cloning (MoClo) toolkit that only takes 2.5 hours to generate desired constructs (5400 potential plasmids) that replicate and express heterologous genes in Enterobacter ludwigii strain AA4 ( Elu ), Pseudomonas putida AA7 ( Ppu ), Herbaspirillum robiniae strain AA6 ( Hro ), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain AA1 ( Sma ) and Brucella pituitosa strain AA2 ( Bpi ) which comprise a model maize root synthetic community (SynCom). In addition to these genetic tools, we describe a highly efficient transformation protocol (10^7-10^9 transformants/Âµg of DNA) for each of these strains. Utilizing this highly efficient transformation protocol, we identified endogenous expression sequences for each strain (ES; promoter and ribosomal binding sites) via genomic promoter trapping. Overall, the MRTK is a scalable platform that expands the genetic engineering toolbox while providing a standardized, high efficiency transformation method that can be implemented across a diverse group of root commensals. These results unlock the ability to elucidate and engineer plant-microbe interactions promoting plant growth for each of the 5 bacterial strains in this study.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":65,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
