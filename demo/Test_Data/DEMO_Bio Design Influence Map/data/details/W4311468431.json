This is the difficult question that is raised in this chapter. Policy statements related to persons with disabilities and genetics that have been published by the National Association of Social Workers are analyzed and discussed in light of this question. Many persons with disabilities have strong concerns about what a “new age of genetics” might mean for the conception of disability, and some of these concerns, which will be explored in greater depth in future chapters, are introduced here.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":214,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
