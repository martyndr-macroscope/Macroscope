This ubiquity is traced to its remarkably versatile metabolism, adapted to withstand physicochemical stress, and the capacity to thrive in harsh environments. Owing to these characteristics, there is a growing interest in this microbe for industrial use, and the corresponding research has made rapid progress in recent years. Hereby, strong drivers are the exploitation of cheap renewable feedstocks and waste streams to produce value-added chemicals and the steady progress in genetic strain engineering and systems biology understanding of this bacterium. Here, we summarize the recent advances and prospects in genetic engineering, systems and synthetic biology, and applications of P. putida as a cell factory. Key points: • Pseudomonas putida advances to a global industrial cell factory. • Novel tools enable system-wide understanding and streamlined genomic engineering. • Applications of P. putida range from bioeconomy chemicals to biosynthetic drugs.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":24,"cited_by_count":225},"references":227,"networkCitations":24,"seed":false}
