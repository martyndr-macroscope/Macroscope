Bioactive hybrids are sufficient solutions as they perform independente self-replication, differentiation of cellular structure, active metabolism, spatial propagation, adaptation, transformation, and morphogenesis. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for the design, fabrication and implementation of these hybrids in the built environment; highlighting their sustainability potentials, by merging synthetic biology, bioengineering and bioprinting, to achieve multiscale active responsiveness. The current work is part of research in biosynthesizing fibroblasts as transformative material in architectural sustainability.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":27,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
