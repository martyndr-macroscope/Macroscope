Utilizing scientometric and bibliometric methods, specifically keyword clustering via VOSviewer and co-citation analysis with CiteSpace, the study provides a comprehensive review of scholarly trends, influential works, research networks and thematic clusters. The analysis identifies key areas such as cybersecurity threats, governance frameworks, data protection, technological advancements and user trust in digital civic engagement platforms. Furthermore, it highlights critical research gaps and emerging challenges related to digital democracy and platform vulnerabilities. By providing an integrated intellectual mapping, this study advances theoretical and practical insights for researchers, policymakers and practitioners aiming to foster secure, inclusive and resilient e-participation systems. Database selection and linguistic scope limitations are acknowledged, with recommendations for broader future research. This work contributes significantly by clarifying the intellectual development of the field and informing policy and governance frameworks for digital civic participation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":110,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
