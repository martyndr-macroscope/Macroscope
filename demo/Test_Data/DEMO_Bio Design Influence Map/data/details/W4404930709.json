New technologies are increasingly being developed to help address loneliness and social isolation in older adults, including monitoring systems, social networks, robots, companions, smart televisions, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications. This systematic review maps human-centered design (HCD) and user-centered design (UCD) approaches, human needs, and contextual factors considered in current technological interventions designed to address the problems of loneliness and social isolation in older adults. We conducted a scoping review and in-depth examination of 98 papers through a qualitative content analysis. We found 12 studies applying either an HCD or UCD approach and observed strengths in continuous user involvement and implementation in field studies but limitations in participant inclusion criteria and methodological reporting. We also observed the consideration of important human needs and contextual factors. However, more research is needed on stakeholder perspectives, the functioning of applications in different housing environments, as well as studies that include diverse socio-economic groups.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":131,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
