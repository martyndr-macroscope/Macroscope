Small molecule biosensors, in particular, help us understand the interaction between chemicals and biological processes. They also accelerate metabolic engineering by increasing screening throughput and eliminating the need for sample preparation through traditional chemical analysis. Additionally, they offer significantly higher spatial and temporal resolution in cellular analyte measurements. In this review, we discuss recent progress in in vivo biosensors and control systems—biosensor-based controllers—in metabolic engineering. We also explore specifically protein-based biosensors that utilize less commonly exploited signaling mechanisms, such as protein stability and induced degradation, compared to more prevalent transcription factor and allosteric regulation mechanism. We proposed that these lesser-used mechanisms will be significant for engineering eukaryotic systems and slower-growing prokaryotic systems where protein turnover may facilitate more rapid and reliable measurement and regulation of the current cellular state. Lastly, we emphasize the utilization of cutting-edge and state-of-the-art techniques in the development of protein-based biosensors, achieved through rational design, directed evolution, and collaborative approaches.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":1},"references":223,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
