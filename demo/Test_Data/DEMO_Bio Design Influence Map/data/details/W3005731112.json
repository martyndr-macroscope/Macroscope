In fact, ethical labor is typically distributed across different kinds of scientists within the scientific community. Based on the empirical data collected within the Horizon 2020 'RRI-Practice' project, we propose a classification of the members of the scientific community depending on their engagement in this collective activity. Our classification offers, on the one hand, a model of how the ethical aspects of science are taken into consideration by scientists and, on the other, some indications on how to institutionalize ethics in science.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":18},"references":48,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
