Hierarchical analysis is utilized to calculate the comprehensive weight ranking of each dynamic graphic design element at the sub-criteria level and to understand the real needs of users from the perspective of user needs and experience design. The relationship between dynamic graphics and emotional relief is explored by comparing the data of the emotional self-assessment scale of the experimental and control groups. After analysis, it can be seen that the perceptual attribute (0.43587) is the most important indicator of perceptual fluency in dynamic graphic design and the most important issue that should be considered in the design, followed by the aesthetic attribute (0.28816). In the analysis of user requirements, content that is vivid, interesting, and colorful accounts for a mean value of 60%. As the use of motion graphics design expands, it will undoubtedly become one of the most basic, versatile, and universal ways of visual communication and artistic expression.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":20,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
