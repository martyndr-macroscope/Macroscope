Understanding how humans will interact with complex vehicle systems and preparing for the functional, societal and psychological aspects of autonomous vehicles' entry into our cities is a pressing concern. Design tools can help calibrate the adequate and affordable level of trust needed for a safe and positive experience. This study focuses on passenger interactions capable of enhancing the system trustworthiness and data accuracy in future shared public transportation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":9,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
