This project began as a study of the emergence and reception of the infant disorganized attachment classification, introduced in the 1980s by Ainsworth's student Mary Main, working with Judith Solomon. Elsewhere I have reported on the findings of collaborative work with attachment researchers, without giving full details of how this came about. Here, I will offer personal reflections arising from the process, and my work in what Hasok Chang has called history as \"complementary science.\"","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":4},"references":116,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
