It uses the artwork of Mithu Sen to visualize the demarcation that we make between technology, animal, plant, and human, as well as to think about technological subversions. Working with technocreep as methodology, this chapter underlines how a creepy methodology showcases a play with categories that simultaneously accentuates and blurs the categories of animal, vegetal, and human.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":260,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
