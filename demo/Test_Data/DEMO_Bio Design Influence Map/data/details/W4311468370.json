These implications relate to the potential utility of both the medical and social model of disability for the profession, social work education recommendations, and the need for the social work profession to support both the training and hiring of persons with disabilities, as well as improved preparation for members of the profession to serve those with disabilities. The history of disablement tells us that those with disabilities are always vulnerable to disparagement and maltreatment, and the social work community needs to step forward as true non-paternalistic advocates, allies, and partners in asserting their value.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":214,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
