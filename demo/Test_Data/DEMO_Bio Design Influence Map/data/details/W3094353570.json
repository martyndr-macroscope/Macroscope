While the practices related to the linear model have been criticized by science policy actors and research funders, who promote more participatory arrangements, the linear model persists in both research policy and practice. This study investigates why and in which form the linear model continues to exist. I focus on the \"professor group on energy policy\", a voluntary and bottom-up science-policy initiative active in Finnish energy policy debates during 2013−2017. The analysis is based on interviews, reports, news articles and observations. I assess both the engagement practices of the group and how they are justified and evaluated. The study demonstrates the prevalence of the linear model as a repertoire that different actors employ to order science and policy. The results point to the need to critically assess the context, politics and expectations related to science-policy interaction.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":21},"references":60,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
