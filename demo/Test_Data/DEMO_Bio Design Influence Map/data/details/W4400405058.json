Unlike conventional studies, this work addresses the challenge of reducing the carbon footprint associated with CDW-based building materials, emphasizing environmental impact mitigation. The study highlights that approximately 30% of CDW is landfilled, 50% is recycled, and 20% is used as fill material, underscoring the potential for increasing recycling rates through improved processing techniques and management practices. In the reviewed studies, most research has been conducted in Europe, Asia, the USA, and China. The primary and secondary data sources for the life cycle inventory (LCI) vary depending on the study region and locality. By exploring innovative practices and critical stages in CDW fine fractions utilization for concrete components, the study aims to contribute to greener construction practices and sustainable resource management. The distinctive aspect of this research lies in its comprehensive review of CDW-based aggregates, binders, and alternative cementitious materials, highlighting the significance of sustainable energy resources and transportation strategies in enhancing the sustainability of CDW-derived concrete. Key findings highlight the necessity of sustainable energy for pretreatment and optimized transportation strategies, including route planning and vehicle selection, to produce greener CDW fine fraction-based building materials. Additionally, the study suggests key steps and parameters required for defining the system boundary and preparing the inventory for conducting an LCA of building materials based on CDW fine fractions. Through a detailed analysis of environmental burdens at each production stage, this study seeks to promote the adoption of greener concrete solutions worldwide. The use of CDW in concrete production promotes environmental sustainability and greener concrete regardless of the region.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":17},"references":91,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
