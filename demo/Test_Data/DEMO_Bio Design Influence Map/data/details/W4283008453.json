Meanwhile, we approach the development of eTextiles through utilizing interdisciplinary practice-based materials research for creating new types of textile-integrated actuators. Our study aims to shed light on how interdisciplinarity and especially the interphase between scientific thinking and practice-based research can create added value both through contrasts and mutual alignments. Based on interviews of researchers working in that intersection, we have identified some key factors concerning specifically the eTextile environment: differences in ways of thinking, intertwining concepts, common practices, and the need for a certain degree of individual autonomy. Overall, we advance the understanding of the inner workings of interdisciplinary projects and how to better facilitate them, as well as provide some concrete ideas of how this type of research should be supported.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":18,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
