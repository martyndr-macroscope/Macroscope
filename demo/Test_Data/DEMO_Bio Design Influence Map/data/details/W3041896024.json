It is an inedible renewable carbonaceous resource that is very rich in pentose and hexose sugars. The ability of microorganisms to use lignocellulosic sugars can be exploited for the production of biofuels and chemicals, and their concurrent biotechnological processes could advantageously replace petrochemicals’ processes in a medium to long term, sustaining the emerging of a new economy based on bio-based products from renewable carbon sources. One of the major issues to reach this objective is to rewire the microbial metabolism to optimally configure conversion of these lignocellulosic-derived sugars into bio-based products in a sustainable and competitive manner. Systems’ metabolic engineering encompassing synthetic biology and evolutionary engineering appears to be the most promising scientific and technological approaches to meet this challenge. In this review, we examine the most recent advances and strategies to redesign natural and to implement non-natural pathways in microbial metabolic framework for the assimilation and conversion of pentose and hexose sugars derived from lignocellulosic material into industrial relevant chemical compounds leading to maximal yield, titer and productivity. These include glycolic, glutaric, mesaconic and 3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid as organic acids, monoethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol and 1,2,4-butanetriol, as alcohols. We also discuss the big challenges that still remain to enable microbial processes to become industrially attractive and economically profitable.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":94},"references":159,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
