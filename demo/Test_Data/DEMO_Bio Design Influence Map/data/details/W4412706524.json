In the first, the article’s author journeyed through a series of underground caves to encounter the bones of moa and other lost birds that haunt this subterranean world. The art of noticing the bones rendered them a material substrate from which to creatively story the lives and entanglements of these birds. In the second, the author recounts a ceremony for the reintroduction of the underground parasitic flower, wood rose, to an ecosanctuary. Here the focus is on the haunting absence of wood rose’s locally extinct pollinator, the lesser short-tailed bat. The article argues that multispecies ethnography in landscapes of extinction can generate new possibilities for the conservation of damaged multispecies relations.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":34,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
