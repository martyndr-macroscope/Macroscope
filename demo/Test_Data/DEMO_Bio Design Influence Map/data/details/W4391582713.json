Research in this domain has seen significant growth over the past five years. However, a clear division of topics within this field is found lacking. This study addresses this gap by examining the intersection of fashion and sustainability, assessing its evolution, characteristics and potential research topics. The study aims to assess past literature on sustainability in fashion, ascertain research trends and provide future research directions as well as implications. Exhaustive search was conducted using the comprehensive database of Scopus considering studies conducted before February 2023, the earliest study having been published in 1963. The resulting sample of 658 articles was analysed using topic modelling method of text mining in R software with Latent Dirichlet Allocation covering various studies on sustainable fashion from manufacturing to marketing. Results of the topic modelling analysis revealed that sustainable purchase intention and behaviour are at the top of research output. We present strategies and challenges for implementing a circular economy in the fashion sector. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to apply a topic modelling approach to examination of sustainable fashion literature. It offers comprehensive and interdisciplinary assessment of this sustainable fashion research.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":15},"references":100,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
