A focal point of policy initiatives, digital village construction aims to harness digital technology to empower rural development. Despite widespread recognition of its potential benefits for agricultural development, empirical evidence on its specific impacts, particularly on farmland scale operation, remains scarce. This study investigates the relationship between digital village construction and farmland scale operation in China, leveraging data from Sichuan Province’s rural revitalization strategy and Peking University’s Digital Village Index. Our analysis reveals a significant enhancement in farmland scale operation, particularly in non-poverty and non-border villages, after addressing potential endogeneity in the estimation. Mechanism analysis demonstrates that digital village construction drives scaled operation and management through improved agricultural production efficiency, the establishment of agricultural industry systems, and the advancement of agricultural engineering projects. However, its impact varies across village types, underscoring potential disparities in rural development. These findings suggest that continued investment in digital village construction is essential to stimulate rural development, focusing on leveraging digital technologies to enhance agricultural productivity and providing targeted support for remote and underserved rural areas to bridge the digital gap and foster inclusive growth.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":13},"references":58,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
