First, 20 mould strains were screened for efficient mycelium growth, with optimized conditions of temperature, sources of carbon and nitrogen in the medium, and type of culture (submerged or surface). A method was developed for creating a biocomposite based on the mould mycelium, reinforced with commercial bleached softwood kraft (BSK) pulp and fibre additives (cotton, hemp). The best properties, including mechanical, water permeability, and air permeability, were shown by the biocomposites containing 10–20% Cladosporium cladosporioides mycelium grown in surface or submerged cultures, milled with BSK pulp, cotton, and hemp (10–20%). The mould mycelium was refined with cellulosic fibrous material, formed, pressed, and dried, resulting in a biomaterial with good mechanical parameters, low water permeability, and high air permeability. The biocomposite was fully biodegradable in soil after 10 days in field conditions. The use of the biocomposite as a crop cover shortened the germination time and increased the percentage of germinated onion, but had no effect on parsley seeds. This study shows the potential of using mould mycelium for the production of biomaterial with good properties for applications in horticulture.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":52,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
