This paper aims at reflecting upon and discussing the relationships of humans with other species in biodesign - drawing on the analysis of existing frameworks that organize it. The questions that drive the discussion are: (I) What are the frameworks that organize biodesign? and (II) what do these frameworks say about the relationships of humans with other species in biodesign? Resulting from systematic and narrative literature reviews, seven frameworks are analyzed. The analysis reveals different attitudes towards other species. We argue that biodesign might not be a collaboration.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":9,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
