This paper aims to explore new perspectives of design and production processes toward environmental, social, and cultural sustainability through bio-fabrication. After an analysis of the context of reference and a review of existing literature, the research focuses on experimentation with bacterial cellulose (BC) to investigate the limits and potentials of controlled growth, waste processing and integration, accessories creation and recyclability, and the assembly/disassembly of clothing and/or accessories at the end of life.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":7},"references":51,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
