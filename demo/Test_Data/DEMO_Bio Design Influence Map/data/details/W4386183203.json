These processes of change have required long periods for the impact to become visible. However, since the Industrial Revolution, these alterations have progressed much faster, threatening our living planet, using natural resources in a predatory way, degrading ecosystems, breaking nature's circular economy and using it as a waste space. In search of a possible solution to all this, new forms in the field of design are studying existing strategies in nature to apply them to the entire development of the human species, always in harmony with the environment so as not to destroy life on Earth.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":6,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
