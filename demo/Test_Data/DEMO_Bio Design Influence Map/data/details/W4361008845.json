It negativelyaffects human health, productivity, and well-being. The world is presently at apivotal stage with this universal epidemic to recognize the relationship valuebetween the built environment, nature, and man. Therefore, the research adoptedthe biophilic approach in design to bridge this gap, restore this relationship, andtreat the harmful isolation effects of the coronavirus. Hence, the concept and roleof biophilia in healing, increasing productivity, and reviving the built environment,were investigated. An urban and another architectural project, which adopted thebiophilia design besides its latest measurements of influencing users in theclassifications of projects and its reliance on the three sustainable bio-design levels,were presented and analyzed. The most significant features of environments thatembrace activities were collected to evaluate and enhance them within anyenvironment. This approach has categories and patterns and is measured andassessed by three rating systems. Accordingly, a checklist was established as adesigner's guideline to accomplish the biophilic approach. Furthermore, aformulated progressive evaluation model was to execute this checklist, proceed,and sequence across its nine objectives and three levels for attaining this approach,thus connecting man with the natural environment.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
