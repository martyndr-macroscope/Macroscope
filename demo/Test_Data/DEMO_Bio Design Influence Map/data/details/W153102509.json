The examples range from the design of an efficient cellular factory for the semi-synthesis of the antimalarial drug artemisinin, to the chemical synthesis of chromosomes, both bacterial and eukaryotic. In parallel, advances in the deep characterization of cell machineries in the simplest cells show that we are very far of fully understanding the regulation of metabolic and genetic circuits. Biological emergent properties and noiseNoise may suppose an obstacle for predictive design. Besides the obvious biotechnological benefits of synthetic biology, the path towards the artificial cell will report new insights on the essence of life.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":20,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
