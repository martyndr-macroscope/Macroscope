With research goals to modify existing biological systems or to create new ones, the recent applications of synthetic biology have expanded approaches and tools for conventional biological research. In this article, we first briefly review the development and progress of synthetic biology over the past decade. Although the contributions of synthetic biology to basic life science research, human health, environmental protection, and even economic growth have been widely observed, potential biosafety, biosecurity, and ethical risks related to synthetic biology have also emerged in recent years as technology becomes less expensive, more mature, and more accessible. We provide a brief assessment of the risks associated with the possible misuse or abuse of this technology in various areas and discuss concerns from three points of view: biosafety, biosecurity risks, and ethics. Finally, to address challenges arising from the rapid progress of synthetic biology, technical, ethical, and regulatory measures were developed or discussed in recent years, including laboratory level precautionary measures for biosafety and biosecurity related to synthetic biology (such as genetic safeguards and firewalls), ethical codes of conduct for biological scientists, and regulations or oversight rules from personal, national, and international perspectives. A brief summary of these efforts is provided.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":12,"cited_by_count":111},"references":72,"networkCitations":12,"seed":false}
