Implementing Research Through Design (RTD), existing information solutions are surveyed (Stage 1); ten material information tag ‘research artefacts’ are generated (Stage 2); and artefact evaluations are carried out by 38 undergraduates, leading to a Design Specification Master List (Stage 3). A finalized tag is designed based on the research findings. The study contributes knowledge on the content and presentation of materials information, demonstrates a systematic approach to evaluating research artefacts within an RTD framework, and discusses its applicability across conventional and emerging material contexts and practices.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":40,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
