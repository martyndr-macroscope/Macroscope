They create sculptural installations that incorporate both film and animation while exploring body-based responses to ecology. As a neurodivergent artist and curator with sensory processing differences, Sam creates work in non-verbal ways that begin and end in movement and embodied interactions without recourse to traditionally privileged verbal and written forms of communication. Recently they created a series of work called 'Porosity' which looked at embodied sensory relationships to the Humber Estuary, with a focus on stimming and ecological perception.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":11,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
