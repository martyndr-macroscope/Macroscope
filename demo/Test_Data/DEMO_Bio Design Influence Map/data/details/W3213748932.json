Materials Informatics is an interdisciplinary discipline based on the foundation of material science and aimed at promoting the effectiveness of new material development. Although laboratorial materials' research provides valuable information and data, product designers who lack material professional knowledge cannot effectively apply that information into the production design process. This review summarizes requirements for material information by product designers from the perspective of categories, and defines the research status of material information in the product design and research methodology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":24,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
