Its development concept, strategy, products and services are in line with the development concept of Circular Economy (CE), which is the development trend of commercial banks and other financial institutions in the future. This paper aimed to promote the efficient use of resources, reduce environmental pollution, improve the health of the ecosystem, provide a better ecological environment for people, and promote sustainable development by integrating ecological investment and circular economy. The development of GI and CE is of great significance for environmental protection, energy conservation and emission reduction, coordination of economy, society, resources, and environment, and it is also a need to promote the development of financial institutions themselves. Based on the research results of GI and CE, this paper analyzed the coupling development of local GI and CE in the eastern, central and western regions by using EM, CRITIC (Criterion Importance Through Intercritical Correlation) method, coupling model, panel data and other methods. It also provided suggestions on the policy of the coupling development of GI and CE in the eastern, central and western regions. This paper started with the relevant economic variables of each year, established the measurement indicators of GI and CE, comprehensively evaluated them using EM, and then studied them using comprehensive evaluation system. The development index of CE in 2020 was 0.3806, but its score in ecological environment was higher than that in 2019. This paper summarized the current development of CE, which can provide experience support and reference for provincial governments in formulating SD strategies and exploring SD paths.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":20,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
