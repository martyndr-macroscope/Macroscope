As such, this chapter excavates the social formations constituted by surveillance vigilantes and the technocreep of surveillance cameras by examining the development of patents for home security devices and the use of these devices by Nextdoor users. This vigilantism is read through the ways in which the security state imbricates feminist, racialized, and gendered subjects to reorganize fundamental assumptions about property. In the name of security, surveillance vigilantes attempt to protect their property and their neighborhoods. The original patent was developed before technologies such as Nextdoor that in turn shaped it into a powerful surveillance apparatus reinforcing existing power differentials around class, race, and gender. An alternative version of home security could have built upon communal and collective ways of conceptualizing communities and collectives.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":260,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
