With the aim of influencing local public policies and taking part in the decision making around the project, a group of neighbors formed a citizen platform called the Cercs Anti-incineration Platform (PAIC). In this case study, we present the strategies that the activists followed to become an influential actor in local and regional politics. We describe how a group of citizens became a translocal assemblage and what obstacles were encountered with interaction and administrations. Finally, we highlight the need to broaden the concept of public participation within administrations.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":7},"references":68,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
