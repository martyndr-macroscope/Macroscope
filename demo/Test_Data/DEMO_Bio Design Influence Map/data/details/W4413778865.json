While the former aims to distinguish between science and nonscience, the latter mobilizes partial overlaps to explore intricate relations between epistemic practices. Although a relational approach embraces the benefits of epistemic diversity, it also recognizes tensions between standpoints. Standpoints are often not related through collaboration and mutual learning but rather through exploitation and oppression. The second part of the chapter takes this relational approach into practice through our work on causal explanations in the fishing communities of Siribinha and Poças. Fishing expertise in these communities challenges a simplistic divide between the alleged “holism” of traditional knowledge and the “mechanism” of modern science. A relational approach, therefore, highlights the opportunities of connecting epistemic tools of communities and academic researchers while also recognizing substantial differences in their reasoning about ecological dynamics.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":560,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
