However, with the emergence of gene editing babies, data leakage, environmental pollution and other events, people gradually realized the negative impact of innovation, and thus responsible innovation was born. As the public is one of the important participants in responsible innovation, it is necessary to study the diffusion of the public's responsible innovation behavior. In this paper, a new infectious epidemic model based on two-layers is proposed to explore the influence of information on responsible innovation behavior diffusion. In this paper, the microscopic Markov chain (MMCA) method is used for analysis, and the Monte Carlo (MC) is used for verification. It is found that the transmission rate of information, the forgetting rate of information and other factors will affect the scale and burst threshold of responsible innovation. Through the research on the influencing factors of the diffusion of responsible innovation, we can get inspiration to draw policy inspiration, so as to promote the diffusion of responsible innovation in the public.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":23,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
