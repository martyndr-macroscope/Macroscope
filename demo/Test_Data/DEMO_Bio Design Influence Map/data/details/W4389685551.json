Strikingly, the productive role of these expectations has received little scholarly attention. We adopted a grounded theory approach to study the participatory planning process for Seelig Park in Breda, the Netherlands. We observed that expectations are flexible, dynamic and diverse and they can be tuned to fit and justify actions and decisions while keeping the planning process in motion. We conclude that expectations become productive as a means for 'recalibration,' reflecting the continuous quest for equilibrium between action and legitimacy in the politically negotiated context of spatial planning.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":39,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
