Through a detailed examination of a project-based learning (PBL) initiative, the study showcases students specializing in “Applied Physics and Nanomaterials” engaging in creating nanostructures via electrochemical etching and their subsequent transformation into Nanoart. This educational endeavor exemplifies the seamless integration of STEAM components—combining scientific principles, technological application, engineering design, artistic creativity, and mathematical precision—and significantly deepens students’ understanding of these elements. The article details each project phase, from conceptualization through execution, illustrating how students navigate the complexities of nanoscience and apply their interdisciplinary knowledge to produce tangible artistic and scientific outcomes. By transforming abstract scientific concepts into visually and intellectually stimulating Nanoart, the project encourages creative thinking and innovation among students. It further demonstrates how integrating art into STEM subjects can make scientific education more accessible and engaging, attracting a more comprehensive array of students and enriching their academic and practical experiences. Additionally, the study discusses the broader implications of Nanoart in STEAM education, emphasizing its effectiveness in bridging the gap between scientific exploration and artistic expression. It argues that this approach not only demystifies complex concepts but also fosters a holistic educational environment that prepares students to think critically and creatively across disciplines.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
