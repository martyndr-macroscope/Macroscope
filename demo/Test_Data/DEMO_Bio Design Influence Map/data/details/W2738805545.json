Previous studies of metaphors in science news have examined edited press reports and the use of metaphors by journalists. However, this study looks into the use of metaphors by scientists interviewed in live broadcasts. Using conversation analysis, interviews are explored for the insertion of metaphors by scientists or their uptake of metaphors that their hosts introduce. Metaphor use is shown to respond to the interactional context and participants’ roles in communicating the topic reported.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":58,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
