The role of a scientist in the process of a scientific breakthrough becoming a public policy was explored. The need for communication of science by the scientist to a wide range of audience is explored as part of the policymaking process. Modules of the course included the need for communication of science knowledge to a non-science population, public science awareness, stakeholder analysis, various methods of communication, and information on the process of science based public policymaking. Students explored the promotion of equity and sustainability through deliberative practices. Students were trained as facilitators for deliberation in a group setting. Assessments through assignments such as message box creation, framing of science as a story, creating one-page science information flyers, formatting of science news articles, and stakeholder analysis of a socio-science issue were used to examine the critical thinking skills and oral and written communication skills of the students. The major project for course involved three sub-projects: (1) Literature review to understand the background of an identified socio-scientific issue; (2) Identification of public policies on the identified socio-scientific issue in the 50 states of the United States; and (3) Creation of new policies to address the deficiencies in existing public policies towards achieving equity and justice. This chapter details the course structure and the modules used.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":40,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
