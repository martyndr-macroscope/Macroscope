This article discusses the effectiveness of the Arduino Science Journal app in implementing a scientific participatory model. The research hypothesis is that the electronic form of participatory scientific activity can reduce anxiety and increase stress resistance. The model itself represents the joint work of undergraduate students, masters, PhD students, and teachers from the Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University. The questionnaire-based SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis was conducted to receive feedback on the suggested work plan. The results showed that the suggested work plan has a number of disadvantages, such as limited software functionality, disorganization within the project team, and app freezing. The results of this test mainly coincide with those discussing the effectiveness of participatory management. However, the limited number of publications on participatory digital projects in higher education leaves this question open for further discussion. This issue is especially relevant in Central Asia, where hierarchical models of interaction are traditionally stronger. The materials provided in this article can be used in educational institutions worldwide for updating or designing innovative curricula based on a participatory model of interaction.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":34,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
