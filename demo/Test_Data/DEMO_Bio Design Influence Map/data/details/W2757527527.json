Situating this genre within a broader TV tradition of 'destructive testing' programmes, there is a description of the forms of destruction visited upon the iPhone, and an analysis of the features shared by the videos (e.g. mode of address, enactments of the experiment). Drawing on the notion of the 'idiotic', there is a discussion of the genre that aims to treat its evident lack of scientific and citizenly 'seriousness' productively. In the process of this discussion, the notions of 'feral science' and 'antithetical citizenship' are proposed, and some of their ramifications for Citizen Science and Public Understanding of Science/Public Engagement with Science and Technology presented.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":6},"references":33,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
