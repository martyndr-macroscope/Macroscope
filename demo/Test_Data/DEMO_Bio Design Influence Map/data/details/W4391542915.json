However, it is still challenging to quantitatively link the dynamic behaviors with measured parameters in synthetic circuits. Here, we propose a dynamic delay model (DDM) which includes two simple parts: the dynamic determining part and the doses-related steady-state-determining part. The dynamic determining part is usually supposed as the delay time but without a clear formula. For the first time, we give the detail formula of the dynamic determining function and provide a method for measuring all parameters of synthetic elements (include 8 activators and 5 repressors) by microfluidic system. Three synthetic circuits were built to show that the DDM can notably improve the prediction accuracy and can be used in various synthetic biology applications.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":59,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
