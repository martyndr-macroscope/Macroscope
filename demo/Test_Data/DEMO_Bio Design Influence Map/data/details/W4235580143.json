Futile Labor explores the relationship between movement as an indicator for life and the notion of agency, through the growth and construction of skeletal muscle cells as an actuator. Here, I reflect mostly on a couple of somewhat opposing trajectories. The first is concerned with the illusion that developments in biotechnology and the design of Neolife might offer an opportunity to break free from hegemonic social constructions of species, gender, race, and class and its relations to labor. The second futility referred to the human attempt to control and fully instrumentalize living material.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":14,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
