Design/methodology/approach Data collected from 303 farmers in the region of Western Macedonia (WM) were used to identify the adoption factors of the circular bioeconomy. Principal component analysis (PCA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) techniques were applied through a custom-designed and specially structured questionnaire. Findings The results reveal four main motivations that lead farmers to adopt circular bioeconomy practices in their farming activities: interest in physical-economic resources and factors related to production and consumption; technology and renewable energy and the environment. Research limitations/implications This study is based solely on farmers in WM. Furthermore, this study assumes that there will be a strategy to promote a circular bioeconomy under the auspices of the government. Originality/value Few studies have focused on the perspectives of crop farmers and what encourages them to adopt circular bioeconomy practices in their crops. Existing barriers are related to economic incentives and constraints. The more circular bioeconomy practices farmers adopt, the greater the positive impact on the environment and rural development, and the factors influencing the adoption of these practices are investigated here.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":4},"references":49,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
