Moreover, this study proposes a dynamic weight-based NSC method. Because noise is ubiquitous in reality, the evolution of system dynamics often cannot be carried out strictly according to the iterative rules. In addition, this study shows the changing rules of the competition relationship and the distribution of competitors under the interference of noise. Finally, this study controls the style of the art pattern design in the spatial domain and uses the mask image pattern to disguise the art style. The experimental study shows that the CAD fractal art pattern design system based on the RBF neural network algorithm proposed in this study has a good effect on fractal art pattern design.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":18,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
