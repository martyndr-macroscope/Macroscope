{"id":"W4376651281","title":"Missing species: Discursive design activism","authors":["Margaret Rynning"],"venue":"Nordic design research conference","year":2022,"doi":"10.21606/nordes.2023.23","url":"https://doi.org/10.21606/nordes.2023.23","openalex":"https://openalex.org/W4376651281","abstract":"Through a design case, “Missing species”, this article presents how design activism can be applied to a discursive design project and proposes a model for discursive design activism. The case study addresses the issue of biodiversity and invading plants due to humans’ interaction with nature and suggests how design may inform and engage societies and individuals through critical imageries, possibly leading to local engagement. Design activism and presenting design outside of galleries and spaces for designers may lead to a larger and more targeted audience for discursive design.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":28,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
