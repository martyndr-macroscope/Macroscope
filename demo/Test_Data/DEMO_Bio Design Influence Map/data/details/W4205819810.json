Two main scenarios offer different solutions. The first scenario aims to further intensify scientific- and technology-driven agriculture research. The second scenario aims to radically switch to nature-based solutions in agricultural systems. There seem to be two interpretations of the nature-based solutions scenario: on the one hand, the interpretation of the IUCN regards nature-based solutions, such as regenerative agriculture, as using nature and denies a link with biomimicry; and on the other hand, the interpretation of the EU regards regenerative agriculture as an example of biomimicry. This raises the question: is regenerative agriculture a prime example of biomimicry or is it only a very important way to use nature in agriculture? To answer this question, we take a step back and philosophically reflect on biomimicry. Based on two definitions of mimesis, we distinguish between two concepts of biomimicry, a ‘strong’ concept which emphasizes natural principles and copying natural models, and a ‘weak’ concept, which emphasizes inspiration by nature and creative invention. Secondly, we describe and analyze regenerative agriculture as part of the nature-based solutions scenario and interpret regenerative agriculture first as ‘weak’ and then as ‘strong’ biomimicry. Both interpretations have their problems. To address these, we propose a new concept of biomimicry based on a new definition of mimesis. This enable us to differentiate between biomimicry, strict imitation of nature, and nature-inspired invention. We argue that our conceptualization of biomimicry helps to operationalize regenerative agriculture as a biomimetic technology.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":13},"references":20,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
