Drawing from mainly recent literature on various approaches, interpretations and definitions of GA and CBE, this article identifies key themes, sub-themes and aspects and their respective relationships to the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. Impressions of GA and CBE on a triangular “canvas” of sustainability provide a visualization of not only similarities and differences between the two pathways, but also gaps toward sustainability. Finally, the findings suggest that a more integrated, balanced approach is necessary to accelerate the greening of architecture in a quest for sustainable livelihood, fairness, and viability, for all.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":15,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
