Soft technologies – defined by plastic embodiments, self-organisation, and multi-scalar material design – challenge hegemonic visions of machines as rigid, unfeeling, and subordinate to human control. Case studies in soft and biohybrid robotics, wetware computing, and nanotechnology demonstrate how emerging soft technologies embody unprecedented forms of artificial agency and outline future possibilities for embodied intelligence. A paradigm shift towards softness fosters 'micro-sustainability', embedding self-contained, regenerative energy and resource management at the material scale. By complicating the separation of nature and artifact and the hierarchical relationship of humans and technologies, the paradigm of softness contributes to a broader 'ecology of technology', offering pathways for sustainable innovation in the face of global ecological challenges.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":30,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
