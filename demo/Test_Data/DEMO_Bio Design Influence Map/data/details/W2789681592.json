Because of the lifestyle of the original isolate, however, the nutritional repertoire of P. putida EM42 is centered largely on organic acids, aromatic compounds and some hexoses (glucose and fructose). To enlarge the biochemical network of P. putida EM42 to include disaccharides and pentoses, we implanted heterologous genetic modules for D-cellobiose and D-xylose metabolism into the enzymatic complement of this strain. Cellobiose was actively transported into the cells through the ABC complex formed by native proteins PP1015-PP1018. The knocked-in β-glucosidase BglC from Thermobifida fusca catalyzed intracellular cleavage of the disaccharide to D-glucose, which was then channelled to the default central metabolism. Xylose oxidation to the dead end product D-xylonate was prevented by by deleting the gcd gene that encodes the broad substrate range quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase. Intracellular intake was then engineered by expressing the Escherichia coli proton-coupled symporter XylE. The sugar was further metabolized by the products of E. coli xylA (xylose isomerase) and xylB (xylulokinase) towards the pentose phosphate pathway. The resulting P. putida strain co-utilized xylose with glucose or cellobiose to complete depletion of the sugars. These results not only show the broadening of the metabolic capacity of a soil bacterium towards new substrates, but also promote P. putida EM42 as a platform for plug-in of new biochemical pathways for utilization and valorization of carbohydrate mixtures from lignocellulose processing.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":93,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
