It provides an explanation of the fundamental concepts of digital practises, risks and advantages, and well-being, as well as the relationships among them. Individuals' digital practises result in both positive and negative outcomes, and these outcomes typically coexist. These links between digital activities and personal well-being are supported by theory and can be followed with some consistency. Descriptive validity and formal theory development should be at the forefront of future research on digital well-being.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":50,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
