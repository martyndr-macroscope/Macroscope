Moreover, this paper applies the interactive signal transmission technology to the interactive product design to improve the real-time information transmission quality of the interactive product. In addition, this paper selects the appropriate filter as the hardware foundation of the system, proposes the overall concept of digital constant ratio timing, and provides sufficient theoretical support for the analog-digital mixing and digital processing links involved in the system. Finally, this paper constructs a system model and combines the experimental research to verify that the interactive product design system based on the intelligent space decomposition technology and the Internet of Things technology can effectively improve the product design effect.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":19,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
