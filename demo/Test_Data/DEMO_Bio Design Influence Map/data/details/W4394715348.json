The concept of sustainability evolves with technology’s ability to understand and replicate nature’s logic. There is a growing need to move beyond punctual solutions towards more intricate and multi-stakeholder considerations, including preemptive assessments of impacts. This article discusses the outcomes of cross-disciplinary material experimentation at Saperi&amp;Co Center, Sapienza University of Rome. This research focuses on enhancing ceramic surfaces through circular economy practices, making them receptive to microorganism colonization—known as bioreceptivity. Through an iterative and repetitive approach, inspired by Research Through Design and material experimentation, several experiments were carried out to study how the innovative use of organic waste in clay-based mixtures can promote bioreceptivity and the design of green surfaces for urban regeneration. The results advance our knowledge on the multiple parameters the designer must consider to transform inert surfaces such as ceramics into “ecological augmentation” devices. The article also aims to raise awareness of bioreceptivity as a practice to educate communities about a symbiotic relationship with nature, promote local economic development and circular production, and prompt reflection on cultural aspects arising from contemporary scientific and technological advancements in line with Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) principles.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":67,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
