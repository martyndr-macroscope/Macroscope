Examining data from in‐depth interviews with farmers and advisors in Scotland through a responsible research and innovation lens with a focus on inclusion, we consider the implications of a changing advisory landscape for responsible digital innovation. Our findings show that the main advisors supporting the adoption of VRPF are based in commercial companies, which mostly target large farms. We explore concerns over bias in the advisory process on the one hand and long‐running trusted relationships between commercial advisors and farmers on the other. The research shows that the current system excludes certain stakeholders from the process. Recommendations include policy and programmes to support collaboration between a broader range of stakeholders, including advisory suppliers and farmers in the innovation process. This can promote more inclusive development of VRPF technologies, which represent the interests of more diverse farm types and avoid exacerbating agricultural digital divides.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":14},"references":40,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
