Many bioreactor models are commercially available in all industries; however, prices are usually exorbitant, making them inaccessible to low-budget research, schools, and start-up companies. This article introduces a low-cost, DIY modular LSF bioreactor system intended to cultivate filamentous fungi and other microorganisms following a minimalist bubble column approach. Using standard sanitary tri-clamp (TC) fittings common in hygienic industries and household brewing setups, this assembly offers an affordable, adaptable, reparable, and robust solution for microbial production at a fraction of the cost of commercial alternatives. In addition, a wide range of budget-friendly sensors and controllers can be integrated to monitor and automate key parameters, making these bioreactors equally accessible and functional. This bubble column bioreactor concept is unique in its scalability and customization possibilities, significantly reducing research and prototyping costs.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":61,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
