Here, we present the GenoMine safeguard, a CRISPR-Cas9-based kill switch for the biotechnological workhorse Pseudomonas putida that employs repetitive genomic elements as cleavage targets to unleash a highly genotoxic response. To regulate the system’s activation, we tested various circuit-based mechanisms including the digitalised version of an inducible expression system that operates at the transcriptional level and different options of post-transcriptional riboregulators. All of them were applied not only to directly control Cas9 and its lethal effects, but also to modulate the expression of two of its inhibitors: the AcrIIA4 anti-CRISPR protein and the transcriptional repressor TetR. Either upon direct induction of the endonuclease or under non-induced conditions of its inhibitors, the presence of Cas9 suppressed cell survival which could be exploited beyond biocontainment in situations where further CRISPR genome editing is undesirable.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":4},"references":74,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
