Integrating stimulus-responsive materials with additive manufacturing offers a possible sustainable and environmental solution to mitigate current sustainability challenges. This perspective literature review comprehensively illustrates the research on 4DP conducted exclusively for art, architecture, and construction (4DPAAC). 3D printing responsive material research across buildings and construction is evaluated, resulting in the identification of seven research areas of 4DPAAC. They offer prospects for advanced building features, varying from fa√ßades to infrastructure, which are critically evaluated for their prospective contributions to reduce energy and material consumption and provide adaptability to climate change.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":12},"references":118,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
