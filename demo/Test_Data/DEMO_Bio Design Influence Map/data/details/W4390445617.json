This approach fosters innovation in industrial, scientific, and design projects, drawing inspiration from the exceptional adaptations, processes, and structures of organisms. The primary goal of biomimicry is to comprehend the complexity and efficiency of natural ecosystems, leveraging this understanding to develop sustainable technologies and utilize natural resources more effectively. While humans have drawn inspiration from nature for thousands of years, the modern term gained popularity in the mid-20th century. Biomimicry is integral to sustainability, offering solutions in harmony with nature by integrating its balances into man-made systems. In medicine, biomimicry taps into the characteristics and processes of natural organisms to inspire innovative treatment methods and materials. In education, it equips students with the skills to comprehend and replicate nature responsibly, inspiring future designers and scientists. Ethical considerations emphasize that learning from nature should occur without causing harm to the natural environment. To unlock its full potential, biomimicry requires broader acceptance, integration into industrial applications, and technological advances for sustainable resource use. The energy sector, for instance, can benefit from biomimicry by enhancing the efficiency of solar panels through inspiration from photosynthesis, offering environmentally friendly energy production solutions. In essence, biomimicry is the key to discovering sustainable, innovative, and ethical solutions inspired by nature. As we delve into the richness of the natural world, this approach plays a pivotal role in shaping future technology and design. This review focuses on current biomimicry research, particularly highlighting its potential in the energy sector. The paper aims to serve as a blueprint for future achievements while shedding light on the unseen limitations of biomimicry.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":12,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
