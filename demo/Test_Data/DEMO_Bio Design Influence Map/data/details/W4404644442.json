Over the past 16 years, advances in stem cell research have transitioned from generating stem cells to utilising these cells in building sophisticated organ models and bioengineered tissues. This transition represents a significant move from the ‘what’ of cell creation to the ‘how’ of constructing and interpreting three‐dimensional human models. Through ethnographic research (including observations and interviews) in Europe and North America, we explore how organoids are constructed and the underlying logic driving their development. Our analysis underscores the growing importance of these in vitro models for human health, urging a sociological examination of their ‘near human’ status. We argue that understanding the implications of this shift—particularly how it influences perceptions of human representation and diversity in biomedical research—requires critical scrutiny from sociologists of health and illness. This paper aims to address the urgent need to investigate not just the experimental challenges but also the socio‐political dimensions of using organoids as proxies for human physiology.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":38,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
