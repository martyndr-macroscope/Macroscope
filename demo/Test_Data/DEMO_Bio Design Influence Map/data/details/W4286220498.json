ELMs may lead to the development of material fabrication techniques which allow us to grow living buildings. However, ELMs research, in contrast to contemporary thinking informed by the new materialist paradigm in architecture, is governed by traditional thinking based on the engineering of industrial systems. This chapter extends the metaphors and models for ELMs research suggesting that for ELMs to provide the scale and complexity of materials and structures in the built environment we need to rethink our approach to biology as well as the research practices and our models of technology development.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":23,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
