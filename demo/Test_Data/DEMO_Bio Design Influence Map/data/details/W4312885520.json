In this, universities and other educational institutions have a crucial role in research, teaching, and service within the academic community and beyond. In this role, educational institutions also contribute to building and strengthening technical and relational human capabilities. It enables people to understand rationally better and emotionally connect more deeply with sustainability challenges and the diverse ways to continue solving them. In strengthening capabilities to respond to sustainability challenges, the contribution of a diverse range of areas of knowledge is required in the learning dynamics. Some areas of expertise that have been known for their human-centered approach to innovation processes4, such as architecture and design, play a significant part in the search for ideas that propose new ways to meet the challenges of sustainability while promoting well-being for people and other life forms and the environment. From architecture and design, the range of possibilities to develop ideas is broad, ranging from the proposal of new products, buildings, spaces, services and processes to recent activities and lifestyles.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":4},"references":14,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
