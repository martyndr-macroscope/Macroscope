The framework proposed in this paper aims to help new (biofabricated and non-biofabricated) \"growing\" and \"living\" materials make a good name out of themselves by deploying all their unique sensorial qualities in a more poetic manner. We believe that adopting wine tasting philosophy and techniques in the field of (aesthetic) materials experience and the synthesis of a materials experience lexicon will enable the commercialization process of new materials. We identify three layers of the material experience and point to how adapting the wine tasting protocol and dialogue formats can inform the grammar, syntax and narrative of a material experience.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
