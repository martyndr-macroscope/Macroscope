Through a series of clay-forming experiments, the system’s performance under various process parameters was examined. Precision sensors and data recording devices were used to monitor and record key data during the experimental process in real-time. The results demonstrate that the automatic feeding system can supply clay steadily and continuously under set parameters, ensuring a smooth forming process and significantly improving efficiency. Quantitatively, the system achieved a 30% increase in Vickers hardness, reflecting enhanced mechanical properties of the formed clay bodies. Additionally, there was a notable improvement in axial stress–strain characteristics, indicating better structural integrity and consistency. These improvements reduced human errors and material waste, enhancing production efficiency and product quality. Future research will focus on further optimizing system design and exploring its applications in a broader range of ceramic manufacturing processes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
