We show how breed varieties are designed, informed by the social, material and moral embeddedness of cattle breeding associations' visions of the future and how they draw on science and technology in their breeding strategies. Based on an analysis of the trade magazines of three different breeding associations, we illustrate how breeding associations are working to establish four different varieties of Swedish Mountain Cattle (SMC). We conclude that the concept of designing cattle enables us to unpack how breeds are socially constructed and institutionally stabilized through sociotechnical imaginaries.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":35,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
