So far no methodology has been concieved for bio-design. A methodology would render the field more accessible by those without deep biology knowledge. Existing bio-design applications were reviewed and a novel classification scheme was proposed. The classification scheme forms the initial step towards the design methodology and is also a key contribution to the emerging field of bio-design.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":9},"references":21,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
