The Action aims to establish a network of researchers and stakeholders testing the hypothesis that: 'A circular flow system that implements nature-based solutions (NBS) for managing nutrients and resources within the urban biosphere will lead to a resilient, sustainable and healthy urban environment.' They are the starting point towards deeper exploration of how NBS can contribute to circular cities, gathering state-of-the-art knowledge of one of the biggest COST Actions so far.In Focus–a book series that showcases the latest accomplishments in water research. Each book focuses on a specialist area with papers from top experts in the field. It aims to be a vehicle for in-depth understanding and inspire further conversations in the sector.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
