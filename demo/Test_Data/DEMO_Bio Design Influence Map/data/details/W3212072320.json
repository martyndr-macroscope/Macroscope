Such approaches are increasingly advocated for use in the field of health. We review the instrumental and epistemological claims made in support of participatory modelling approaches. These accentuate participatory models as offering a better evidence-base for health policy decisions. By drawing attention to recent modelling experiments in a sector outside of health, that of water management, we outline a different way of thinking about participation and modelling. Here, the participatory model is configured in relation to matters of 'knowledge controversy', with modelling constituted as an 'evidence-making intervention' in relation to the making of science and expertise. Rather than presenting participatory models as an improved technical solution to addressing given policy problems within an evidence-based intervention approach, models are alternatively potentiated as sites for the redistribution of expertise among actor networks as they seek to engage politically in a matter of concern. This leads us to consider possible new directions for participatory modelling in the field of health.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":18},"references":97,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
