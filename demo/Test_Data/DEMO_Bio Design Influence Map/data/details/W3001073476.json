These new artistic practices are developing under the appellation of &#8220;bioart&#8221; and have for effects to blur the border between arts and science. These artists are taking over laboratories and manipulate the living. Many scientists venture themselves into those new territories or collaborate on creations. This field of artistic investigation inspires a number of reflections from bioethics. Entitled &#8220;Art(bio)ethics&#8221;, this special issue proposes an encounter between bioart and bioethics in order to offer a recent and varied sample of reflections on the relations developing between these two disciplines.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":10,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
