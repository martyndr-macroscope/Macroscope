Agricultural waste represents a big proportion of it and utilization of this waste in developing biodegradable packaging material has gained interest among research scientists. The incorporation of living systems into it has attracted considerable attention for the synthesis of sustainable and environmentally friendly materials. Thus, mycelium-based foams and composites are an evolving class of biocomposites that are based on growing fungal mycelium (specifically white rot fungus) on lignocellulosic agricultural wastes. The physical, structural, mechanical, biological and chemical characteristics of these composites are affected by the type of substrate, fungal strain and manufacturing process. Hence, the current review focuses on the substrates and fungal strains used for manufacturing these biocomposite materials as well as their impact on their properties. As a result of their stiffness, elasticity, porousness, less density, fast growth, and low cost, mycelium-derived materials can be used in a variety of applications, including construction, packaging, medicine, and cosmetics. Moreover, the biodegradability, renewability, bioavailability, and nontoxicity of these eco-friendly materials further help mitigate the impact of plastic and agricultural pollution on the environment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":7},"references":93,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
