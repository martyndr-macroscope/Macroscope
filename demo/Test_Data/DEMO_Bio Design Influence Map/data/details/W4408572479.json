This study, grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model, investigates the factors influencing the purchase intention and loyalty of wood-plastic composites (WPCs), specifically examining the impact of material stimuli, surface treatment processes, product carriers, and environmental stimuli on consumersâ€™ perceptions of uniqueness and emotional responses. A total of 335 valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), with the results indicating that material stimuli and product stimuli were the strongest predictors of perceived uniqueness and emotional responses. Moreover, emotional response had a significantly stronger effect on purchase intention compared to uniqueness perception. Additionally, material familiarity positively moderated the relationship between emotional response and purchase intention. This study provides theoretical support for the marketing of WPCs, emphasizes the significance of integrating material properties, surface treatments, and usage environments in product design, and suggests new avenues for future research, particularly regarding the relationship between multisensory experiences and consumer behavior.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":131,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
