Furthermore, this paper proposes that the spatial pattern will influence the aggregation value in wireless sensor networks, as well as the influence of the pattern of single-point extrapolation function and information coverage function measurement, which is quantified as a nonsampling error in sampling theory. Then, this paper proposes a hierarchical sampling theory to optimize the nonsampling error and improve the effect of artistic situation perception. Finally, on this basis, this paper constructs an art design system of context awareness and interactive experience. The findings of this study indicate that the state-of-the-art mobile system user interaction experience based on context awareness suggested in this work has a strong context awareness effect and user interaction experience.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":1},"references":23,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
