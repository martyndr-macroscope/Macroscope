The complexity and the scale of planetary changes, though, often feel elusive, or even unintelligible. This article aims to discuss the need to address the particularities and agency of the ocean, specifically exploring the role of art in empowering people to realize their bonds to the planet’s oceans and seas. After discussing the problematics of the long-established separation of land from sea, just like of culture from nature, the article presents theoretical positions that oppose these constructed binaries and approach oceans and seas as living bodies and at the same time as a medium. Four different artistic works are analysed with the goal to draw conclusions on how to live and be with the ocean, acknowledging its fluidity, diversity and complexity.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":5,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
