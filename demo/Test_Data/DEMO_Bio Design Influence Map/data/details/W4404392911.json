The production of leather goods significantly contributes to air and water pollution and generates challenging waste disposal issues. The present study explored emerging sustainable paradigms in the leather goods industry through both social and strategic analyses. The results indicate that, although consumers are often unaware of the differences among leather types, there is a growing openness to sustainable alternatives and a willingness to pay for these products. Quality and durability are key consumer priorities, though a bias toward fast fashion persists. Notably, while consumers value vegan leather as a sustainable alternative, experts caution that synthetic leather alternatives may have greater environmental drawbacks compared to traditional leather. The work supports SDG 12 by advocating for reduced reliance on materials with a high environmental impact and the adoption of sustainable alternatives. Enhanced consumer communication may also drive the industry toward a model that integrates environmental and social responsibility with profitability. Given the prestigious status of leather goods within the Made in Italy initiative, the present work suggests that the value of vegan leather may increase within the global market.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":4},"references":78,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
