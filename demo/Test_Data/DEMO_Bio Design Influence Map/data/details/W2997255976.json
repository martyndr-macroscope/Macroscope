Within the study entitled \"Architecture at Arte Sella\", parametric design, structural validations and CNC procedures are exploited to help define, control and assess several architectural woodworks, created with famous designers. This contribution describes the design and construction experiences of Atsushi Kitagawara (2017) and Kengo Kuma (2018–2019), the two masterpieces installed in the land art park of Arte Sella (Trento, Italy) and developed, thanks to the Politecnico di Milano team, from design to mock-ups, testing and construction.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":8,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
