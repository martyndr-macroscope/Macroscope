Some authors speculate that the approximation to biology could mark the design practice of the 21st century. It seems relevant to understand how teaching and learning are happening in biodesign to develop how it could be further introduced in design curricula. It doesn’t seem that an analysis of formal education was made yet. To address this research gap, this paper aims to understand the formal education scene in biodesign through an analysis of some of the main biodesign courses and programs. The methodological strategy is a systematic and a narrative review through a popular search engine. 16 results were analyzed: 1 Masterclass for Professionals, 8 courses, 1 undergraduate course (Major), 4 master’s, and 2 Ph.D. programs.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":4,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
