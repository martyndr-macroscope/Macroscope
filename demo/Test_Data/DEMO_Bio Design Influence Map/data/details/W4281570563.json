However, there is a deficiency in the understanding of potential consumers’ perceptions. This paper compares the perception of non-designers as well as designers towards design-embedded bio-materials. Data was collected from 234 respondents using an online survey. The findings were gathered by evaluating perception in terms of desirability, practicality, aesthetically, and familiarity with living and non-living biomaterials.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":4},"references":24,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
