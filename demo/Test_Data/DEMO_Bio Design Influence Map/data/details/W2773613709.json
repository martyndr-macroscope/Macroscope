We start with a general overview of design activity as defined by Larson and Dorst[1]. Next, perspectives on design are presented by two of the paper's authors, specifically in the following areas: identifying and framing design problems, design representations, the iterative process, reflection, and evaluation. Finally distinctions and connections across the perspectives are described. A deeper understanding of the differences and similarities in the perspectives of design activity across the two fields of design and engineering, that engage in design help identify spaces for shared language or where abstractions may be necessary, enabling better collaboration and thus, adding to the technical literacy of all design related areas.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":9,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
