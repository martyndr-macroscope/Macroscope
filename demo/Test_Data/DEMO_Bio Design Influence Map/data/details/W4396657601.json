The use of blue-green roofs in combating climate change issues has continued to grow, and its benefits are showcased in many countries' studies. However, there is an absence of reports on the use of this approach in South Africa. Therefore, in ensuring a sustainable built environment through nature-based solutions, this study explored the built environment professional’s knowledge of blue-green roofs, the hindrances to their use and motivations for much wider use of blue-green roofs in the country. Design/methodology/approach Based on the nature of the study, a quantitative design was adopted and data were obtained from professionals within the built environment through a questionnaire. Data analyses were conducted using the Cronbach alpha test, Kruskal–Wallis H-Test, exploratory factor analysis and fuzzy synthetic evaluation. Findings The findings revealed a growing knowledge of blue-green roofs, albeit its slow adoption in the country. Also, five critical clusters of hindrances affecting the use of blue-green roofs were identified. These are understanding the blue-green roof concepts, technical, economic, regulation and client hindrances. Furthermore, the ability to manage stormwater properly, provide climate change adaptation and deliver sustainable buildings were the key motivating factors that could drive the use of this innovative solution. Practical implications This study offers actionable insights for built environment professionals and stakeholders to address the hindrances to using blue-green roofs in South Africa. Strategies such as improved education, financial incentives and policy development can help overcome some notable hindrances and promote the widespread adoption of blue-green roofs. Originality/value The slow adoption of blue-green roofs and the scant nature of research within the built environment required adequate attention to which this current research contributes. Theoretically, being one of the foremost studies in South Africa to explore blue-green roofs, the findings offer a foundation for future studies seeking to explore this roofing system in the country further.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":7},"references":46,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
