To literature studies, this has led to a focus on comprehension and proficiency at the expense of aesthetic aspects of fiction-reading. This study examines how teachers in Swedish upper secondary schools relate the aesthetic experience to literature studies. Data was collected using an online questionnaire, answered by 22 teachers. The findings suggest that participants are aware of and include the aesthetic aspects of fiction-reading, while at the same time prioritizing instrumental goals, such as language development and reading comprehension.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":55,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
