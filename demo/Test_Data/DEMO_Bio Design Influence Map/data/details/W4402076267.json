Green building materials are defined by their eco-friendly properties, which include energy efficiency, resource conservation, and minimal environmental harm. This review explores the latest innovations in green building materials, highlighting advances such as recycled and upcycled materials, biodegradable and bio-based products, and high-performance insulation technologies. Additionally, it examines smart materials, including self-healing and phase-change materials, which offer enhanced durability and responsiveness to environmental conditions. Despite these advancements, the adoption of green building materials faces several challenges. High initial costs, performance and durability concerns, and supply chain issues present significant barriers to widespread use. Regulatory and certification processes also pose hurdles, impacting the accessibility and integration of these materials in construction projects. Looking ahead, future trends in green building materials are promising. Emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology and sustainable manufacturing processes, are set to revolutionize material science. The integration of green building materials with smart building technologies promises enhanced energy efficiency and performance monitoring. Additionally, the expanding market for green certifications and the potential for circular economy practices, including design for disassembly and closed-loop material systems, offer new opportunities for sustainable development. While the innovations in green building materials present exciting opportunities for sustainable architecture, overcoming existing challenges is crucial for their broader adoption. Continued research, development, and collaboration among stakeholders will be essential in shaping the future of green building materials and achieving long-term sustainability goals in the built environment.
