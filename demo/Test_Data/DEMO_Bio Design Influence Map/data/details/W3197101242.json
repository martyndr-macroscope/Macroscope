This study deals with the redevelopment of buildings built in the last decades of the Nineteenth century, with a style that can be defined \"post-modern\". In those years, communication became an architectural theme superimposed and abstract by functional and structural needs, with \"architectural elements\" abstract in a hyperbolic way with respect to the function. The result of an architectural culture, interesting for the research they narrate but incongruous with functional needs, also because of the materials used, the energy and architectural requirements impose a review to combine functional performance, in nZEB projection, and structural with the need for \"venustas\", what is \"done well\", the same facet of the same architectural rationale. The need to renew these spaces must take into account the qualities of forms that, with their material decay and in the peculiar language, may not bring out the centrality of preserving and compositional choices of the work.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":2,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
