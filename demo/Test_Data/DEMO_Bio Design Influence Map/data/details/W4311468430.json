Specific focus includes those thought to be insane, as well as persons with epilepsy and individuals with sensory disabilities (blind and deaf). The chapter highlights not only why those with a moron diagnosis were the principal targets of eugenicists, but also how this diagnosis was exploited by eugenicists to pull ancillary groups (e.g., those living in poverty, single women with children) into the sphere of eugenic control.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":214,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
