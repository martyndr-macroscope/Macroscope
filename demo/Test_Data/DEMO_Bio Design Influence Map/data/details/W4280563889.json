The results evidence the identification of a wide range of construction products with different certified recycled contents and Italian origin under the certification standard “Remade in Italy”. Moreover, 42% of the certified products rely on the use of LCA for the assessment of the environmental impacts, while 22% of certified products integrate the features of recycled content with the recyclability at the end-of-life. Overall, results show the role certifications may have in increasing the information available on products and their environmental quality, including their traceability in the reverse supply chain, becoming a potential driver for CE adoption and a wider development for such products.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":23,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
