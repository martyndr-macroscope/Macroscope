During the meeting, a climate forecast is made with the participation of diverse operational, governmental and scientific institutions that produce and use different aspects of the information, ir order to assist decision making. This paper presents the genesis and evolution of the meetings, showing how the SMN's openness to the users' participation gives a framework of legitimacy, recognition and authority to the entity’s practices of knowledge co-production.
