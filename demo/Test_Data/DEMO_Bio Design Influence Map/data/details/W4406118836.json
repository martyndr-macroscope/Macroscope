Following a critique of the growing reliance on technical solutions to sustainability issues, the author calls for a shift toward value pluralism and epistemic humility, offering reforms to reshape research and higher education priorities.In this article, the impact of AI-driven solutionism in research and innovation is critically examined, with a particular focus on sustainability challenges. It is argued that overreliance on technical solutions often ignores ethical complexities, leading to two risks: overlooking diverse values and epistemic hubris. The author examines how current trends in academia, research funding, and industry partnerships perpetuate a solutionist ideology, potentially marginalizing critical ethical discourse and participatory decision-making. He highlights the need for a shift towards value pluralism and epistemic humility in research and innovation. He concludes by proposing reforms in higher education and research funding to foster these principles, offering concrete examples of their implementation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":36,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
