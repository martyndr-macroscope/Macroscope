Finding a link between pricing and the purchase of sustainable clothes is the aim of this study. Regression models and t-tests of two independent samples (two-tailed tests) were applied by means of the application of a questionnaire. The study found that consumers' willingness to pay for price increases is related with non-linear (quadratic or exponential) product pricing. The results of this study suggest that consumers are willing to pay higher prices for sustainable clothing. Through an understanding of the relationship between price and consumer behavior, businesses can more effectively align their pricing strategies with the demands of environmentally conscious consumers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":52,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
