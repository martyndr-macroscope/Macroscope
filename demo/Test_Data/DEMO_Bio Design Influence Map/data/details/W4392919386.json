In response, we introduce the concept/practice of “biofuturing,” a creative research approach concerned with the co-design of multispecies speculations of worlds to come. We engaged 21 scholars in a 3-day biofuturing event, combining a living lab methodology with futures studies techniques and creative practices. In this article, we present biofuturing in theory and practice, and we discuss how the co-designed futures speculations address existing and emerging challenges from a multispecies perspective.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":36,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
