Several theoretical frameworks underpin this exploration, such as embodied cognition, Michael Levin's computational boundary of a \"Self,\" and Donald D. Hoffman's Interface Theory of Perception, which lead to considering human perceived outer reality as a symbolic representation of alternate inner states of being, and where AGI could embody a different form of consciousness with a larger computational boundary. The paper further discusses the necessary architecture for the emergence of an embodied AGI, how to calibrate an AGIâ€™s symbolic interface, and the key role played by the Metaverse, decentralized systems and open-source blockchain technology. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of achieving a certain degree of harmony in human relations and recognizing the interconnectedness of humanity at a global level, as key prerequisites for the emergence of a stable embodied AGI.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":44,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
