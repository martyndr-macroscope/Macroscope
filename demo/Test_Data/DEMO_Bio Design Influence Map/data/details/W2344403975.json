We link these to efforts to move away from the 'ethical, legal and social issues' framework of interdisciplinarity and towards a post-ELSI collaborative space. It is in trying to open up such a space that we identify the need for: collaborative experimentation, taking risks, collaborative reflexivity, opening-up discussions of unshared goals and neighbourliness.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":103,"cited_by_count":100},"references":27,"networkCitations":103,"seed":false}
