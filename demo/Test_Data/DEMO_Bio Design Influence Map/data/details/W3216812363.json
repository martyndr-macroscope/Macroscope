In this chapter, multi-omics data mining approaches will be discussed as a novel tool for the identification and characterization of novel DNA sequences encoding elementary parts of complex biological systems (BioBricks) using omics libraries. Multi-omics data mining opens up the possibility to identify novel unknown sequences from free-access databases. It also provides an excellent platform for the identification and design of novel BioBricks by using previously well-characterized biological bricks as scaffolds for homology searching and BioBrick design. In this chapter, the most recent mining approaches will be discussed, and several examples will be presented to highlight its relevance as a novel tool for synthetic biology.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":151,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
