In the first part of the paper, we present the design journey from acquiring the eggs to harvesting movement in orchestrating the improvised ambient music and elaborate on the aspects of materiality and temporality that crafting the habitability involved. In the second part, we reflect on the alternative relationship as intended and embodied during the four months of co-habitation and discuss the ethical and other emergent issues informed by designer-researcher's autoethnography.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":19},"references":49,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
