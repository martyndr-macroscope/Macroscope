Black soldier flies (BSF; Hermetia illucens ) are gaining traction for their ability to rapidly consume large quantities of organic wastes. However, these are primarily used to produce a small variety of products, such as animal feed ingredients and fertiliser. Using synthetic biology, BSF could be developed into a novel sustainable biomanufacturing platform to valorise a broader variety of organic waste feedstocks into enhanced animal feeds, a large variety of high-value biomolecules including industrial enzymes and lipids, and improved fertiliser.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":22},"references":142,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
