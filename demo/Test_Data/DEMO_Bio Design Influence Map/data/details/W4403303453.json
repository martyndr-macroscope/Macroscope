Aimed at facilitating the transition, several policy frameworks, operational tools and assessment instruments have been developed in recent decades. Nevertheless, the integration of circularity in the construction sector remains constrained and haphazard, frequently focusing solely on the production phase and neglecting the comprehensive impacts within the overall process. The detected gap between theoretical framework and practical implementation is reflected by the limited coordination between policies and tools, which creates a significant obstacle to the adoption of consistent and effective practices. A dual analysis is conducted, comprising two parallel domains: an investigation of a circular policy theoretical framework in urban environments through a literature review, and an analysis of practice-oriented tools through resilience assessment and green building rating systems. As a result, common ground and shared targets are identified between the two scopes, as well as contrasts and inconsistencies that require further attention. These are classified according to their role as barriers or drivers of change, and recommendations for synergistic improvement between policies and tools are provided.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":69,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
