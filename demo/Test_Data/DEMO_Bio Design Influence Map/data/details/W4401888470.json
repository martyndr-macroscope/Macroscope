Following environmental sustainability initiatives in the wake of a parasitic infestation of tobacco in Andhra Pradesh, I analyze experts’ concern for landowning farmers in contrast to their passive neglect and active resentment of landless laborers. The article draws parallels between the experts’ pedagogies and the parasite’s deceptively attractive bloom, which hides complex entanglements between parasite and plant beneath the soil surface. I show that a postcolonial emotional regime idealizes landowning farmers and renders invisible the experts’ and farmers’ common cultural milieu of landownership and collective dependence on caste-based labor. Invoking nostalgia for a lost past, experts’ pedagogies are productive, subsidizing monoculture while neoliberalizing farmers’ subjectivities. By their absenting, laborers face climate precarity and the reproduction of resentment against them.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":62,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
