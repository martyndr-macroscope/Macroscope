Yet the idea that microbes can ‘teach’ us how to navigate complexity, adapt across scales, and sustain planetary systems is still marginalised in science, policy, and education. A paradigm shift is proposed: microbes must be reframed as active collaborators in solving global challenges. This perspective is grounded in microbial ecology, Indigenous knowledge, and ethical philosophy, advocating for ‘learning’ through and with microbial life. To institutionalise this transition, policy and educational reforms are urged, centring microbial literacy as a foundation for ecological understanding. By integrating microbial agency into human knowledge systems, societal actions could be realigned with the biochemical and evolutionary logics that have sustained life for millennia. Ultimately, a deeper engagement with microbial knowledge is called for—one that informs a more sustainable future.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":82,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
