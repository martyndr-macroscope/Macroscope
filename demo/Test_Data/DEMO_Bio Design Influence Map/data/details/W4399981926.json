However, each project is too specific to simply replicate existing patterns. Especially in early projects with a high degree of uncertainty, where indicators and measures cannot be applied, the so-called provenance assessment as a methodological change of perspective makes it possible to assess the procedural quality of research by means of narratives. A clear picture of the challenges for European bio-economy projects is sought by mapping the broader debate on \"RRI in practice\" in the context of biotechnology. The SUSPHIRE project is used as a case study to show how project-specific narratives integrate and signify RRI. By unpacking various concepts of \"responsibility\" that are already present in the project narrative at an early stage, I will show how this assessment differs significantly from other attempts to \"do RRI\". It is precisely in the absence of other criteria that the assessment of provenance can bring to the fore the specific form(s) of responsibility inherent in the development of projects.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":32,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
