Our analysis of these data highlights three key themes from scientific collaborators about the impact of ethics integration: (1) the development of an ethical culture and expectation for ethics integration throughout the research and design process; (2) the usefulness of offering different modes of ethics engagement to foster productive collaborations between ethicists and researchers; and (3) the fostering of ethics capacity development within scientists themselves. We also report on researchers' perspectives on the challenges of measuring the effectiveness of ethics integration.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":1},"references":54,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
