Specifically, it concerns a structure of mycelium bio-composite, produced at the lowest possible environmental cost. The design uses an optimal structural form to maximize the material’s efficiency. The development of the structure is initially modular, using two different types of geometric blocks. At the same time, the whole structure gradually becomes monolithic with the help of the plant part of the fungi, the mycelium. The basic 2D arch structure is initially assembled using two different geometric blocks. More complex configurations can be derived from this foundational module to meet various requirements for applications and structures. The structure will be constructed entirely of load-bearing mycelium blocks, with its geometry specifically designed to emphasize compression forms, enhancing the structural performance of the inherently weak material. This approach reflects an innovative vision for construction materials grounded in the principles of cultivation and growth from natural, earth-derived resources.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":35,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
