The adaptive movements of the Gazania flower were studied through a morphological-functional analysis and then used in the abstraction phase for the design of the biomimetic system, through parametric modelling. Climate-based daylight metrics and luminance metrics were evaluated for the different kinetic alternatives developed. The results of the parametric simulations, carried out for different occupant positions in an office building in a temperate Mediterranean climate show that the biomimetic kinetic system is well suited to provide the office space with variable natural daylight between 87,5 % and 100 %, promoting energy efficiency and user comfort. The results correspond to the optimal ranges of climate-related daylight metrics that prevent glare and overheating by shielding direct sunlight. The study also highlights the importance of further research, including material's prototyping, to validate and improve the proposed design and its translation into technology. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of combining principles from biology, materials science and architecture to develop adaptable and sustainable design solutions that address sunlight and indoor comfort challenges.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":13,"cited_by_count":34},"references":73,"networkCitations":13,"seed":false}
