I ask: how can new cross-movements between bio-inspired science and design be fostered? How might we envision the future possible intersection between technology and nature? First, I recall key aspects of classical bioinspired engineering and highlight the role of nature in the emergence of technology. Second, I introduce a new approach to bioinspired engineering. In this approach, robots play an active role in design and construction, learning from material properties to form new shapes and thus reshaping design paradigms. The distinctive elements of this approach depart from classical nature-inspired engineering and foster a symbiotic relationship between technology and nature. I conclude by reflecting on the intersections of nature, technology, and design, and envisioning new avenues for interdisciplinary dialogue that foster collaboration and innovation among diverse bio-inspired disciplines.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":5},"references":32,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
