It contains plant and biological components that cause the design system transformation and ensure dynamic visualization of the images. The methodological concept of the study is based on systematic and interdisciplinary approaches, which allow to assess living visual communications as integrated design systems. The author’s methodology includes analysis and systematization of examples; the formation of the integrated design model is based on an associative-metaphorical approach and substantiation of development strategies of ecological visual communications. The study resulted in the development of two groups of visual communication systems, namely green visual communications and biological visual communications. Their visual language was created on the base of such processes as landscaping, facing, encapsulation, energy recovery, and self-organization. The developed model of integrated design of living visual communications allows to put together artificial and natural components using their associative similarities. This model is considered an instrument for decision-making that is aimed at the implementation of ecological innovations into the design of dynamic visual communications. This study broadens the possibilities of using the living organisms in design and substantiating eco-strategies of communication design development in the context of forming designers’ creative potential.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":7},"references":34,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
