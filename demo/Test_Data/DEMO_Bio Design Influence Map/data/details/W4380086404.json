And across worldwide basic, translational, clinical, and applied re-search, and throughout the bioindustries, scientific breakthroughs have been the launching point for principal bioproduct developments in the translational trajectory. Even the most innovative healthcare technologies being translated in the right direction, would provide patient benefits only when adopted by clinicians and/or patients in actual practice. So, co-development between innovation-related builders and customers is a key agile principle. And in the coming wave of innovation in the broad-scope applications, learning rapidly what new bioproduct features work well for clinicians and patients will become even more crucial.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":9,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
