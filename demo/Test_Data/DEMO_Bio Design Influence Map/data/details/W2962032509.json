In addition to the potential socio-economic benefits of synthetic biology, they also examined the ethics and security risks arising from the development of these technologies. Speakers from industry, academia and not-for-profit organizations presented their vision for the future of the field and provided guidance to funding and regulatory bodies to ensure that synthetic biology research is carried out responsibly and can realize its full potential. This report aims to capture the collective views and recommendations that emerged from the discussions that took place. The meeting was held under the Chatham House Rule (i.e., a private invite-only meeting where comments can be freely used but not attributed) to promote open discussion; the findings and quotes included in the report are therefore not attributed to individuals. The goal of the meeting was to identify research priorities and bottlenecks. It also provided the opportunity to discuss how best to manage risk and earn public acceptance of this emerging and disruptive technology.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":123},"references":38,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
