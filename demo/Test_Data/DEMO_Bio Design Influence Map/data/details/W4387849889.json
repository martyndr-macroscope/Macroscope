Though citizen science has become more common in environmental monitoring, it is seldom utilized in environmental epidemiology. In the CitieS-Health project, we co-created epidemiological studies with citizens in five European countries. The aim of this paper is to share our experiences and impart methodological insight into the application of co-created citizen science strategies in environmental epidemiology.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":9},"references":46,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
