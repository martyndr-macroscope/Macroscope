The complicated diversity and structure of spider silk ensure its use in both nature and industry. Based on the uniqueness and distinctive qualities associated with spider silks, advancements in cloning and expression of these silks are a growing area of research and industrial use. The environmentally triggered spider silk assembly and further disassembly, the creation of fibers, films, and novel chimeric composite materials from genetically modified spider silks are interesting areas of research in nanotechnology. In this context, we have discussed the creation of hybrids made of spider silk that combine with organic nanoparticles, both naturally occurring and bioengineered spider silk proteins. The diversity of spider silk, its composition and architecture, the distinctions between spider silk and silkworm silk, and the biosynthesis of natural silk are also discussed. This article describes the current issues and expected outcomes using biochemical data and processes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":60,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
