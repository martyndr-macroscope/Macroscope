Thus, education must be oriented towards mathematics and natural sciences accompanied by social and human sciences. Therefore, this study aims to describe the empowerment of critical thinking skills through a problem-based learning model viewed from the epigenetic aspect. This research employed library research. In this study, data collection was obtained from news, articles in journals, and relevant books. The analysis was carried out in four stages: 1) data collection, 2) data reduction, 3) data display, and 4) conclusion. This study's results revealed that learning needs to pay attention to nature and nurture because it dramatically affects the mastery of thinking skills, and bridging the two things in learning will be a challenge for science teachers in the future. The problem-based learning model can be utilized as a natural science learning model that can empower critical thinking skills from an epigenetic perspective. It can be concluded that the cellular and molecular mechanisms of learning and memory have long been a major focus of neurology and molecular biology, a concern regarding the epigenetic mechanisms behind dynamic changes in the transcription of genes responsible for memory formation and maintenance.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":20,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
