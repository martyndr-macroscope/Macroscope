Based on the analysis of the size of bioeconomy in the V4 countries it can be concluded that the sustainable transition is a great challenge and can be achieved by developing national circular bioeconomy strategies. It is extremely difficult to analyse the contribution of different sectors to the performance of the circular bioeconomy. Currently, the contribution of different sectors to the biomass-based economy is very complex, therefore a strategic socio-economic planning and optimal resource allocation is necessary to achieve the goals of the bioeconomy. This paper aims to determine the place and role of the bioeconomy in the structural change of the linear economy, based on detailed matrices of in- and output relations between different sectors. Based on the input-output matrices, as well as centrality and flow metrics of network analysis, the role of the bioeconomy in the linear economy, its multiplicative effects and future research implications are analysed.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":12},"references":61,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
