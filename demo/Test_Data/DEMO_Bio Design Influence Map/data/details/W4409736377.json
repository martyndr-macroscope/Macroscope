Despite the popularity of online sex work, it is frequently disregarded in conversations surrounding platform labor and contemporary notions of domestic life. By employing performance-based research, the author proposes to embrace the ambivalence formed by the combination of maintenance and play to gain deeper insights into the poetics and politics of visibility of the platform.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":260,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
