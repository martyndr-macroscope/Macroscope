The use of non-biodegradable materials, obtained from non-renewable sources, contributes heavily to environmental pollution throughout the textile production chain. As sustainable alternatives, considerable efforts are being made to incorporate biodegradable biopolymers derived from residual biomass, with reasonable production costs, to replace or reduce the use of synthetic petrochemical-based polymers. However, the commercial deployment of these biopolymers is dependent on high biomass availability and a cost-effective supply. Residual forest biomass, with lignocellulosic composition and seasonably available at low cost, constitutes an attractive renewable resource that might be used as raw material. Thus, this review aims at carrying out a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on the use of residual forest biomass as a source of new biomaterials for the textile industry, identifying current gaps or problems. Three specific biopolymers are considered: lignin that is recovered from forest biomass, and the bacterial biopolymers poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) and bacterial cellulose (BC), which can be produced from sugar-rich hydrolysates derived from the polysaccharide fractions of forest biomass. Lignin, PHA, and BC can find use in textile applications, for example, to develop fibers or technical textiles, thus replacing the currently used synthetic materials. This approach will considerably contribute to improving the sustainability of the textile industry by reducing the amount of non-biodegradable materials upon disposal of textiles, reducing their environmental impact. Moreover, the integration of residual forest biomass as renewable raw material to produce advanced biomaterials for the textile industry is consistent with the principles of the circular economy and the bioeconomy and offers potential for the development of innovative materials for this industry.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":102,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
