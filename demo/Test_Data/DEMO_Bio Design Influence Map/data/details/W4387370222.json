How can we actively engage them in educational experiences to stimulate discussions and reflections about social issues? To answer this question, we conceived a workshop-like experience where we put into practice three well know methods and concepts, such as co-design, citizen science, and game thinking. The final output of the activity is a low-fidelity prototype of a mobile application, co-designed by a group of students. By taking advantage of open-ended making to engage participants in the ideation of a gamified/game-based citizen science application, we stimulated discussions and reflections about serious topics, such as sustainability and digital wellbeing. The pictorial described the workshop-like experience and the low-fidelity prototypes, engaging 45 students.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":1},"references":27,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
