The presence of b-sheets in the conformation of silk fibroin and spidroin improves their mechanical properties. The strength and toughness of pure silk fibroin and spidroin are relatively low. Hence, blending is the foremost approach of recent studies to optimize silk fibroin and spidroin's mechanical properties. Numerous research investigations evaluate the blending with natural and synthetic polymers, summarized in the present review. The effects of blending silk fibroin and spidroin with natural and synthetic polymers on the mechanical properties are discussed. Indeed, the blending of natural and synthetic polymers with silk fibroin and spidroin change their conformation and structure, resulting in fine-tuning the blends' mechanical properties.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":75,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
