The research methodology involved a bibliometric analysis. Data was acquired from the Scopus database to categorise keywords and identify key thematic areas within sustainability research. It provided a co-occurrence map using VOSviewer to understand the interdisciplinary nature of NBS integration and its implications for environmental management and sustainable development in the built environment. The findings of the research revealed that integrating nature-based solutions (NBS) into stealth construction practices offers significant environmental, social, economic, and regulatory benefits, including carbon emissions reduction, improved air and water quality, enhanced community well-being, and alignment with sustainability goals for both high-income and low-income regions. The originality of this research lies in its comprehensive examination of the feasibility and benefits of NBS integration in stealth construction practices, thus informing policymakers, urban planners, and developers in designing more effective strategies for promoting environmental sustainability and resilience in the built environment.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":3},"references":56,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
