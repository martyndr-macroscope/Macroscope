These are traceable to the unsustainable construction practices employed by most of the construction industry globally. Hence, the need for effective energy management and sustainability. With biomimicry, the study and emulation of nature's entirety to offer sustainable solutions to human challenges, an era of novel and eco-friendly source of inspiration is heralded. This study sets out to examine the biomimetic energy management and sustainability for the reinvention of the construction industry. Literature review was conducted on nature-inspired ways and strategies of energy management and sustainability. Findings from the study revealed technology, policy, and education as major areas where biomimicry seeks to sustainably address energy challenges. The adoption and application of biomimetic strategies is important, as it offers much potential in energy management and sustainability.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":17},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
