It aims to give a more central role to end users in producing (public sector) innovation outcomes. This leads to a new variety of end user roles in innovation activities and poses challenges for both practitioners and policy makers. We offer an in-depth, comparative analysis of such end user roles in three cases of co-creative public sector innovation across Europe. We argue that the definition of particular end user roles is crucial in shaping both the inclusiveness and outcomes of co-creative innovation. We offer a typology of end user roles and their respective limits and potentials with regard to co-creation. Our analysis suggests that, for co-creation to produce useful and legitimate outcomes, the process by which roles are assigned to and negotiated with end users must be part of the co-creative process itself.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":8},"references":55,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
