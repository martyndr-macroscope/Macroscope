This database facilitates the assessment of interrelationships and impacts of these concepts within the civil engineering domain. The findings demonstrate a consistent growth in publications related to these areas, indicative of increasing interest and impact within the civil engineering community. Influential authors and institutions have emerged, making significant contributions to the field. The United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom are recognised as leaders in research on these concepts in civil engineering. Notably, emerging countries such as China and India have also made considerable contributions. The integration of design principles inspired by nature into civil engineering holds the potential to drive sustainable and innovative solutions for various engineering challenges. The conducted bibliometrics analysis grants perspective on the current state of scientific research on biomimetics, biomimicry, bionics, and bio-inspired concepts in the civil engineering domain, offering data to predict the evolution of each concept in the coming years. Based on the findings of this research, ‘biomimetics’ replicates biological substances, ‘biomimicry’ directly imitates designs, and ‘bionics’ mimics biological functions, while ‘bio-inspired’ concepts offer innovative ideas beyond direct imitation. Each term incorporates distinct strategies, applications, and historical contexts, shaping innovation across the field of civil engineering.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":5},"references":163,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
