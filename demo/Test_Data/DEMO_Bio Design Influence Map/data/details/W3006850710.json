Its mechanical properties make it a good candidate for applications in various fields ranging from protective armour to bandages for wound dressing to coatings for medical implants. Spider silk is formed by an intricate arrangement of spidroins, which are extremely large proteins containing long stretches of repeating segments rich in alanine and glycine. A large amount of research has been directed towards harnessing the spectacular potential of spider silks and using them for different applications. The interdisciplinary approach of synthetic biology is an ideal tool to study these spider silk proteins and work towards the engineering and production of synthetic spider silk. This review aims to highlight the recent progress that has been made in the study of spider silk proteins using different branches of synthetic biology. Here, the authors discuss the different computational approaches, directed evolution techniques and various expression platforms that have been tested for the successful production of spider silk. Future challenges facing the field and possible solutions offered by synthetic biology are also discussed.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":18},"references":90,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
