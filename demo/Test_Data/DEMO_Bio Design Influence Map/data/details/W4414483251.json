This article proposes one such mechanism in deference towards authority. Through Structural Equation Model on Eurobarometer 2021 data, I investigate if favoring expert guidance over public participation in decision-making on science-related issues mediates the relationship between people’s socio-economic status and engagement with science. Results show that higher socio-economic status is associated with greater engagement but also with favor toward experts’ deliberation. Preferring experts over public involvement in decision-making is also associated with more informative engagement and less general engagement. Nevertheless, this mediating role is rather weak. Moreover, the study examines how other perceptions of science relate to socio-economic status and engagement, emphasizing the broader social and structural factors that shape opportunities for participation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":93,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
