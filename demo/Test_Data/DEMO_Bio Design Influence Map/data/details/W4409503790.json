Using Ganoderma applanatum , a mycelial growth skeleton with an enhanced static air layer is constructed to optimize the material's insulation and strength properties. The resulting mycelium‐based composites (MBC) achieve a density of 195–249 kg m −3 , a low thermal conductivity of 0.0370 W m −1 ∙K −1 , a maximum flexural strength of 0.382 MPa, and a compressive strength of 2.409 MPa. Additionally, the material exhibits a high water contact angle of 138.6° and a water absorption rate of 44.05%–84.84%. Compared to previous studies, the composites demonstrate superior performance, striking a balance between thermal insulation and mechanical strength. These results highlight the potential of mycelium‐based materials as eco‐friendly alternatives in packaging, construction, and insulation, offering a viable solution to replace non‐renewable insulation products.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":55,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
