Here I introduce Apologos, a lightweight design methodology informed by the author's experience of the challenges and opportunities of interdisciplinary collaboration between computational and social sciences over a five-year period. Apologos, which is inspired by \"design apologetics\", is intended as an initial mechanism to introduce technologists to the process of considering how human values impact the digital design process.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":68,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
