The artwork exemplifies the technological creepiness as characterized in this edited collection through the ways in which it effectively disturbs the prevailing logics of human-machine binaries. Through the theoretical concept of algorithmic intimacies, the essay reveals the messy contradictions of the datafied home and challenges technodeterministic dreams of outsourcing sociopolitical issues to algorithmic systems.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":260,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
