Consortia rely on it for effective communication, responding to changing environmental conditions, establishing community structures, and performing collective behaviors. Microbial signal transduction can be through quorum sensing (QS), two-component signal transduction systems, biofilm formation, nutrient sensing, chemotaxis, horizontal gene transfer stress response, and so forth. The consortium uses small signaling molecules in QS to regulate gene expression and coordinate intercellular communication and behaviors. Biofilm formation allows cells to adhere and aggregate, promoting species interactions and environmental stress resistance. Chemotaxis enables directional movement toward or away from chemical gradients, promoting efficient resource utilization and community organization within the consortium. In recent years, synthetic microbial consortia have gained attention for their potential applications in biotechnology and bioremediation. Understanding signal transduction in natural and synthetic microbial consortia is important for gaining insights into community dynamics, evolution, and ecological function. It can provide strategies for biotechnological innovation for enhancing biosensors, biodegradation, bioenergy efficiency, and waste reduction. This review provides compelling insight that will advance our understanding of microbial signal transduction dynamics and its role in orchestrating microbial interactions, which facilitate coordination, cooperation, gene expression, resource allocation, and trigger specific responses that determine community success.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":197,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
