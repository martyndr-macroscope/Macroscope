Traditional Biodesign methods are often restricted to academic or lab environments, making practical application difficult and requiring additional training for those from either background. The 'Homegrown Biodesign Approach' introduces a novel framework specifically designed to be independent of specialized equipment and lab settings, making it accessible for use at home. This approach empowers individuals to develop essential Biodesign skills through hands-on experimentation, observation, and reflection, using only the resources available in their personal environments. By emphasizing learning through doing, it provides practical tools to bridge knowledge gaps, cultivate scientific understanding, and visualize innovative outcomes without relying on expensive resources. What sets this approach apart is its focus on the ethical and philosophical implications of working within oneâ€™s personal space. It encourages biodesigners to reflect on how their environment and values shape their research and creative process, adding a deeply personal dimension to their work. By making Biodesign more accessible and adaptable to diverse environments, this process, soon to be detailed in an open-access journal like Biodesign Research, offers a fresh perspective on translating research into practical applications for everyday life. The attached figure and text demonstrate how this framework enables interdisciplinary skill development and innovation, allowing participants to explore Biodesign beyond traditional lab settings and empowering them to develop solutions that address real-world challenges, regardless of their resources or background.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":7,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
