(2010)); institutional arrangements or procedural factors that constrain the use of new knowledge (e.g.rigid operating protocols -Hidalgo (2018); Podesta, Hidalgo and Berbery (2013); Srinivasan, Rafisura and Subbiah (2011); Taddei (2008); Vaughan and Dessai (2014)); or structural factors that shape the capacity and willingness of different decision-makers to use information (e.g.lack of access to knowledge or of choices regarding alternative technologies or policy changes -Rayner, Lach and Ingram (2005)).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":15,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
