Artificial spider silk can be made from mini-spidroins in an all-aqueous-based spinning process, but the strongest fibers seldom reach more than 25% of the strength of native silk fibers. With the aim to improve the mechanical properties of silk fibers made from mini-spidroins and to understand the relationship between the protein design and the mechanical properties of the fibers, we designed 16 new spidroins, ranging from 31.7 to 59.5 kDa, that feature the globular spidroin N- and C-terminal domains, but harbor different repetitive sequences. We found that more than 50% of these constructs could be spun by extruding them into low-pH aqueous buffer and that the best fibers were produced from proteins whose repeat regions were derived from major ampullate spidroin 4 (MaSp4) and elastin. The mechanical properties differed between fiber types but did not correlate with the expected properties based on the origin of the repeats, suggesting that additional factors beyond protein design impact the properties of the fibers.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":2},"references":79,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
