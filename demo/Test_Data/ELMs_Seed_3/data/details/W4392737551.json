This view underlies a human-ecology relationship based on resource and knowledge extraction. To create a more sustainable and equitable future, it is essential to consider alternative cultural ideas rooted in ecological thinking. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness between humans and more-than-human worlds. We propose a path to reshape the human-ecology relationship by advocating for alternative human-AI interactions. In this paper, we undertake a critical comparison between anthropocentrism and ecological thinking, using storytelling to illustrate various human-AI interactions that embody ecological thinking. We also delineate a set of design principles aimed at guiding AI developments toward fostering a more caring human-ecology relationship.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":66,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
