It is new area of developments in chemistry, biology, computer science, and engineering to let us create products more quickly, cheaply, and precisely than ever before. It can be viewed as a biology-based \"tool-kit\" that changes how we create biological systems and broadens the spectrum of potential solutions for issues in bioremediation of pharmaceutical waste. As medications, insecticides, and petrochemicals continue to be used and abused by humans and form hazardous metabolites, they are wreaking havoc on nature. These toxic substances bioaccumulate in the environment and eventually find their way to people through a variety of channels. Due to their potential for toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and genotoxicity, they are dangerous. The currently known remediation techniques to restore nature are typically expensive and may change one harmful contaminant into another. Utilizing naturally occurring microorganisms, bioremediation techniques convert man-made pollutants into harmless byproducts that, in turn, make soil fruitful. This chapter focuses on the fundamental idea of synthetic biology and discusses its applications in the bio remediation of the pharmaceutical industry and future prospects.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":37,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
