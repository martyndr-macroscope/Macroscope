While the general belief in the profession is that there likely was little connection between the two, the relationship was actually quite close, and during its formative years many in the profession considered eugenic policies to be a potentially important means of supporting its overall goal of improving society. The chapter considers how those in the emerging profession attempted to gain public support for its work, and the role of eugenics within the early identity of the profession. The chapter concludes with a more in-depth exploration of the use of eugenic practices, especially sterilization, to control public welfare expenditures.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":214,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
