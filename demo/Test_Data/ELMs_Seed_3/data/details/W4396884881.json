Discussion of epistemic coalitions has been until recently subsumed within the larger discussion of epistemic communities, which are organizations solely comprised of technical experts. This dissertation seeks to build upon a recent scholarly trend of differentiating instuitional modes of epistemic governance. The puzzle I seek to address relates to the blessings and hurdles of institutional heterogeneity. On the one hand, the tripartite membership of epistemic coalitions can bestow upon them great success in redefining domestic policy problems (third-order policy change). However, epistemic coalitions are also prone to member infighting and being viewed by states as bureaucratically insular. To reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings, I argue that successful epistemic coalitions must undergo a two-track process of resolving internal deliberative agitation while being perceived as equitably balanced by states. Resolving agitation requires each constituent part to coalesce around a founding organizational narrative. Equity perception stems from a normative congruence between national elites and the epistemic coalition's foundational narrative. The confluence of resolved agitation and equity perception allows for epistemic coalitions to initiate a \"teacher-student\" socializing (policy learning) relationship with national elite. After such a relationship has been established, an epistemic coalition can act as a traditional policy entrepreneur to bring about third-order policy change when issues relating to their domain of expertise has been brought to the macropolitical agenda through unusually high amounts of press attention. I utilize mixed method within-and-across case studies to induce this hypothesis. The three domains I examine are the International Olympic Committee's role in American steroid prohibition, the role of the European Chemicals Agency in EU plastics regulation, and the role of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies in guiding MDMA-assisted psychotherapy through FDA approval.--Author's abstract","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":115,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
