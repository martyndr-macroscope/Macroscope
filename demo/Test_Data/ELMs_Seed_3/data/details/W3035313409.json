Combining design and bioscience has the potential to create responsible and desirable products/services, however such ventures come with challenges rising from boundaries between practices. This research explores boundary objects as sources of framing in multidisciplinary collaborations. The results are based on a descriptive study with synthetic biologists and design engineers working on an innovation-driven task.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":2},"references":34,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
