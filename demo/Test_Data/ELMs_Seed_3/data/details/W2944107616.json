The transitive status of hybrids – which establishes an extra, separate, ‘third’ ontological category, going beyond the dichotomy between nature and technology – constitutes a significant problem for environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology since they traditionally focus on either ‘nature’ (natural entities) or ‘artefacts’ (technological objects). In order to reflect on the ethical significance of hybrids, a classification of different types of hybrids is required. Such a clas-sification is provided by this article, based on insights from both environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology. After explaining why a new class of beings emerges in the Anthropocene, and reflecting on the one-sidedness of philosophy of technology and environmental philosophy in their focus on either technology or nature, we propose a new classification of hybrids in this article that provides a new starting point for reflections on the moral signifi-cance of hybrids in environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":30,"cited_by_count":26},"references":55,"networkCitations":30,"seed":false}
