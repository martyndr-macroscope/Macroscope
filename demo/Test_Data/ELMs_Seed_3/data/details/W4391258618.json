The materials ascribed to the sector’s unsustainability are primarily fabrics, plastic, and hazardous solvents, making developing new biobased materials imperative. As such, various strategies have been investigated to convert and recycle waste and give them commercial value via the manufacture of biobased materials. This review discusses the various types of raw materials as sources to develop new biobased materials that could promote the transition toward sustainability. According to the literature, the functional qualities of biobased materials are comparable to those of synthetic materials. Raw material sources such as biomass, derived from plant and animal-based waste, are attractive due to their low cost, abundance, and biodegradability. The manufacture of biomaterials, as well as their characterization and performance, are also discussed. Further, this review will offer a comprehensive view of the potential applicability and current commercial applications of the developed biobased materials in relevant areas such as packaging, construction, textile, and wastewater remediation. This could be a potential field of research to address the environmental challenges posed by the continuous growth of the global population.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":23},"references":117,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
