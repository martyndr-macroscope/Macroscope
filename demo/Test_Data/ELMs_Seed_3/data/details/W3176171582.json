We explore direct interactions with Dinoflagellates, bioluminescent algae that produce light when exposed to oxygen through physical stimulation. Leveraging Dinoflagellates' natural feedback mechanism, we propose directly engaging the human user with the organism through physical kinetic interactions. We take an organism-centered design approach, considering the well-being of the organism by focusing first on designing appropriate environments for the organism, then proceeding to exploring the available interactions within these environments. Our framework consists of four components (form, reception, feedback, and control) and can be used to guide designers in their design process with living matter. We demonstrate the framework with environments for Dinoflagellates and three real-life examples: a checkers game, a ball game. and hopscotch. Last, we discuss the constraints and limitations of integrating Dinoflagellates and living matter in interactive systems.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"bronze","network":{"internal_citations":19,"cited_by_count":40},"references":55,"networkCitations":19,"seed":false}
