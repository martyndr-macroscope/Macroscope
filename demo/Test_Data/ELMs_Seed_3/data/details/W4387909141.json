These developments have critical implications for education and its role in shaping future generations of innovators and critically engaged citizens, all of whom will be responsible for using and stewarding these biotechnologies. This report draws on discussions that took place over the last two years during a series of workshop meetings and public panels in which biologists and science educators, artists and designers, and computer and learning scientists came together to examine three critical areas: the way we can think about biology and design, the role computational metaphors can assume in biodesign, and approaches and tools of biodesign for K-12 education. We have identified several directions for future work, among them the development of (1) conceptual integrations between biodesign and computation for disciplinary connections; (2) tools and designs that will make biodesign understandable and accessible for K-12 students; (3) learning environments in community labs, classrooms, science centers, and homes that will provide access to tools, activities, and support; (4) professional activities and curriculum for teachers on how best to introduce activities in classrooms; and (5) critical biodesign literacies for K-12 students that will promote conceptual understanding and skills as well as critical perspectives on biodesign. We also provide an annotated reading list for those interested in exploring these new applications of biology.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":32,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
