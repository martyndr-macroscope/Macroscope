The algorithm's inputs are defined by combining the results of previous research and specific clay information selected from different regions of Anatolia, utilizing the design of experiment methodology. The design parameters include angle, profile and height; printing parameters include compressor pressure, speed, and layer height; and material parameters are assessed through drop spike, tube pressure, and flow rate tests. Once the inputs and their computation ranges were defined, the algorithm was tested with various inputs and corresponding physical prints to evaluate its recommendation capability. The test prints demonstrated that the printing suggestions made by the algorithm for design, printing and material parameters were suitable for the given parameter inputs. With its current state, the research is not an expert tool for recommendation but a base of a more complex framework for further research.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"diamond","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":25,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
