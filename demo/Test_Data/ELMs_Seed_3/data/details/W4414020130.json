First, it outlines the influences on the emergence of this art form, its first representatives and their specificity. Then, a difference between bio art as a medium and other media is discussed. Several parallels are drawn to show how the medium and the meaning or the theme of a bio art work relates to other types of art work as well as some common practices of manipulation with living organisms. A division of bio art into segments is given, following the example of Nikolai Hartmann's division in Aesthetics, adapted to contemporary conditions of the art form. The division scopes the type of object or being that is a bio art work, the meaning generated within a bio art work, the creative and the receptive act in the context of bio art work. Each of these segments carries with it certain problems related to the fact that the art object is a living being. These problems are related to the theory behind the work, especially to the manner in which life itself is understood and to the ethical position taken by the artist that leads to a certain moral attitude towards the being represented in the work. The theme that necessarily emerges is the theme of life or nature. A certain type of attitude towards the life of a bio-artist is considered in comparison to a traditional artist. It is related to the role an artist in relation to another organism, and the question if this role is an instrumental one or a role of a co-creator. Attention is also given to the specific ways of perceiving a piece of bio art work. All these have common ground in the theme of life, living organism and the human-nature relation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":7,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
