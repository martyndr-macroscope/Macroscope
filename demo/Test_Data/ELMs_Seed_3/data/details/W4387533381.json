Nevertheless, the assessment of long-term safety, efficacy, and rationale behind pursuing microbial products for industrialization in the presence of other alternatives are essential especially in post-COVID-19 pandemic. There are other salient ethical, environmental, economic, social, scientific, and religious concerns not only to the scientists and regulators but also to the users. Such issues include, but are not limited to, intellectual property rights, accidental release and environmental implication, biosafety and bioterrorism concern, economic concern, public trust (societal concern), and consequences of exposure to pathogens by humans and animals both in the developing and developed nations. This work is aimed at acknowledging the role of ethics and proffers some suggestions to ensure the sustainable use and development of microbial products for industrialization. In addition, a framework for microbial products' effectiveness has been suggested which comprises five distinct phases, namely, access, exploration, knowledge acquisition, adoption, and innovation and transformation. Cooperation, equity, and intersubjectivity are the fundamental tripods and relational dimensions for effective communication of ethical issues. The proper regulatory mechanisms, the formation of a professional and ethical society, and the development of relevant checks and balances are essential to circumventing all malicious attempts to misuse these technologies. Regulatory bodies, however, must also consider a wide range of other perspectives such as the economic impact, scientific progress, and risk and moral reasoning for the industrialization and monetization of microbial products.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":71,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
