Green areas, including meadows and river valleys within cities, are useful for short-term water storage. This possibility has become more visible in recent years, as water management is increasingly combined with ecological objectives. However, the potential benefits arising from blue-green infrastructure are most likely only partially exploited due to the lack of a practical understanding of what these benefits are and how best to implement BGI. Therefore, there is a need to translate scientific knowledge of the functionality of BGI into principles for designing the new concept of resilience cities. Another important aspect of the approach to contemporary urban systems is the 'circular economy'. Sponge City as an element of water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) protects local communities against excessive rainwater runoff and at the same time provides new green jobs. In hydrological terms, large impermeable surfaces contribute to surface runoff, which can lead to soil erosion, deterioration in water quality, the risk of flooding and drought.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":37},"references":171,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
