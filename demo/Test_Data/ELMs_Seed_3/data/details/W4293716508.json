In recent years, the global food supply challenge has called for new methods to decrease food waste or recover them to more valuable materials. Indeed, understanding the techniques for reducing and recovering food waste provides insights into exploring the impact of waste food recovery on the environment. This paper aims to review the literature on food waste in production processes. Hence, we employ a bibliometric and thematic analysis to explore a total number of 163 scientific articles published between 2000 and 2021. The present research uses the theoretical model of circular economy to analyse the literature on the topic both thematically and with cluster analysis. The results provide significant implications for academics and practitioners, drawing attention to a closer relationship between people and food waste, increasing the culture of the value of waste in all processes from agricultural production to distribution and consumption. Finally, it reiterates the need to emphasise the pollution caused by food production.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":40},"references":158,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
