Likewise, a frequently stated goal for responsible innovation/responsible research and innovation (RRI), is that R&I processes become reflexive/reflective -such as in the \"R\" of the British \"AREA\" framework: \"Anticipate, Reflect, Engage and Act\" i .While there is no consensus at all on the overall goal and purpose of RRI in the EU -for some, the goal is reflexive practice and governance of science and technology; for others it is \"better alignment\" between civil society and the R&I sector -it is interesting to reflect upon the origin of the RRI concept.Except for sporadic and quite unrelated mentions, the term was introduced by philosopher and European Commission (EC) Directorate-General (DG) Research and Innovation (RTD) policy officer René von Schomberg in 2011.Interestingly, he did so with explicit reference to the potential of technology to have negative ethical and social implications: \" […] we are confronted with the Collingridge dilemma, implying that ethical issues could be easily addressed early on during technology design and development whereas in this initial stage the development of the technology is difficult to predict.Once the social and ethical consequences become clearer, the development of technology is often far advanced and its trajectory is difficult to change.\"(von Schomberg 2011, p. 8) In this regard the so-called Collingridge dilemma is taken to stand for the following: Technologies (created by research and innovation) have negative side-effects (such as risks and hazards), but by the time the side-effects are identified and understood, the technologies have become entrenched in society and infrastructure or otherwise difficult to remove.Neither existing modes of technology assessment, ethics procedures, risk assessment nor market mechanisms have been able to solve this problem.R&I practice and governance accordingly should become more anticipatory -better able to anticipate and avoid R&I trajectories that instantiate the dilemma.This narrative, as well as the accompanying idea that SSH knowledge and practice can contribute in the strive for reflexivity, builds on extensive scholarship -some would say back to Vico (Rommetveit et al. 2013), others to Heidegger and the Frankfurter School, and yet others would make a more easily documented claim that it builds on latter decades' \"Science and Technology Studies\" (STS), history, philosophy and sociology of science and technology, and related strands of scholarship.Indeed, since the late 1960s, there have been various maxims of critical science, radical science, the science and society movement, technology assessment, post-normal science, socially robust knowledge and finally responsible research and innovation that had similar content (see Sardar ABSTRACT T he value of reflexivity has repeatedly been mobilised in claims for Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) involvement in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) research.In short (if not in caricature), the policy narrative goes like this: Scientists, scientific practices, the governance of science and indeed modern society should become more reflective/reflexive.This can be achieved by involving SSH, which are inherently reflexive.In this paper, I will follow this narrative from the \"Ethical, Legal and Social Implications\" (ELSI)/ \"Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects of bio-, neuro-, and nanotechnology (ELSA) policies and practices of the 1990s and 2000s, to the concept of \"Responsible Research and Innovation\" (RRI) and the \"need to integrate\" SSH with STEM to address societal challenges in Horizon 2020.Drawing upon my experience as an SSH practitioner in ELSA, RRI and societal challenges-focused interdisciplinary collaborations, I shall propose two lessons learnt.One key lesson is the need to go beyond the simple policy narrative \"SSH makes science more reflexive\" and the many disappointments that it invariably produces.The other key lesson is the need to go beyond simple dichotomies between SSH research and scholarship on one hand and non-SSH research on the other in order to look for meaningful collaborations.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":12},"references":11,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
