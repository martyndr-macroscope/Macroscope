As a sustainable alternative to plastics, MBCs are gaining increasing interest; however, their large-scale industrial adoption remains limited, partly due to low social acceptance resulting from their unattractive appearance. Laser engraving provides a promising method for fabricating intricate patterns and functional surfaces on MBCs, minimizing tool wear, material loss, and environmental impact, while enhancing esthetic and engineering properties. This study investigates the influence of CO2 laser parameters on the material removal rate during the engraving of myco-composites, focusing on the effects of variable laser power, beam defocus, and head feed rate on engraving outcomes. The results demonstrate that laser power and beam focus significantly impact material removal in mycelium-bonded composites. Specifically, increasing the laser power results in greater material removal, which is more pronounced when the beam is focused due to higher energy density. In contrast, a beam defocused by 1 mm produces less intense material removal. These findings highlight the critical role of beam focus—surpassing the influence of power alone—in determining engraving quality, particularly on irregular or uneven surfaces. Moreover, reducing the laser head feed rate at a constant power level increases the material removal rate linearly; however, it also results in excessive charring and localized overheating, revealing the low thermal tolerance of myco-composites. These insights are essential for optimizing laser processing techniques to fully realize the potential of mycelium-bonded composites as sustainable engineering materials, simultaneously maintaining their appearance and functional properties.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":0},"references":24,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
