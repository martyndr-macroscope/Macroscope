Now, the exploration of microalgae has been gradually deepening, mainly focused on the field of nutrition, medicine, and cosmetics. A great deal of studies has shown that microalgae have a variety of functions in regulating the body health and preventing disease, such as nitrogen fixation, antitumor, antivirus, antioxidation, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic. Furthermore, microalgae can synthesize various high-valued bioactive substances, such as proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and pigments. In this paper, we have briefly reviewed the research progress of main bioactive components in microalgae, proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, pigments, and other nutrients included, as well as their present application situation. This paper can provide the guidance for research and development of industrial production of microalgae.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":71},"references":118,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
