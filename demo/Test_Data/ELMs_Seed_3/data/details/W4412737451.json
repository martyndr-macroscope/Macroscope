A survey questionnaire method involving 50 participants was conducted from 13th June to 27th June 2024. A purposive sampling method was adopted to identify the target sample which was shop floor employees in UK-based fashion retailers. The retrieved data was analysed through the statistical analysis method (SPSS). The questionnaires were divided into two parts where the first part included demographic questions, and the second part included questions related to employee retention and satisfaction within the fashion section industry in the UK. The key findings from the research were that age had an impact on employees' income satisfaction where older employees typically have a negative perception of career progression chances. Women over other genders valued flexible work schedules.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":64,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
