The latter is affected by the CO2 chemisorbed from the surrounding atmosphere, which, combined with shear forces, explain cellulose gelation. Herein, rheology, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) are combined to unveil the fundamental factors that limit cellulose gelation and maximize its dissolution in NaOH(aq). The obtained solutions are then proposed for developing green and environmentally friendly cellulose-based materials.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":9,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
