It discusses four dimensions of creep, including slow movement, touch, intuition, and entanglement. Across these dimensions, technocreep disrupts normative values associated with technological efficiency and innovation. The multimodality of perception inherent in what creep names avoids the pitfalls of reducing technological relations to axes of seeing and being seen (the visual), and instead highlights other sensorial dimensions that are integral to the experiences and uses of various technologies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":260,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
