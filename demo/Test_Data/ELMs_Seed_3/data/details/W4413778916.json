Instead of supporting the livelihoods of communities and transformative change, transdisciplinary research therefore produces at times institutional legitimation through merely symbolic appeals to “inclusion” and “diversity.” Taking these challenges into practice, this chapter focuses on community-based action research on conservation policy, science education, and farming practices. This chapter shows how community-based research can (but also often fails to) support community struggles while navigating tensions with institutional realities of academic research.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":560,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
