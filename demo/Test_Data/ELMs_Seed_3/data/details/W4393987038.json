The aim of this study was to develop a protease cleavable synthetic protein platform to detect protease activity in a rapid cell-free setting. Methods: The protease sensor is modular, with orthogonal peptide tags at the N and C terminal ends, which can be uncoupled via a protease responsive module located in between. The sensor design allows for several different readouts of cleavage signal. A protein 'backbone' [Green fluorescent protein (GFP)] was designed in silico to have both a C-terminal Flag-tag and N-Terminal 6x histidine tag (HIS) for antibody detection. A protease cleavage site, which can be adapted for any known protease cleavage sequence, enables the uncoupling of the peptide tags. Three different proteases-Tobacco, Etch Virus (TEV), the main protease from coronavirus SARS-COV-2 (Mpro) and Matrix Metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9)-a cancer-selective human protease-were examined. A sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was developed based on antibodies against the HIS and Flag tags. As an alternative readout, a C-terminal quencher peptide separable by protease cleavage from the GFP was also included. Purified proteins were deployed in cell-free cleavage assays with their respective protease. Western blots, fluorescence assays and immunoassay were performed on samples. Results: Following the design, build and validation of protein constructs, specific protease cleavage was initially demonstrated by Western blot. The novel ELISA proved to afford highly sensitive detection of protease activity in all cases. By way of alternative readout, activation of fluorescence signal upon protease cleavage was also demonstrated but did not match the sensitivity provided by the ELISA method. Discussion: This platform, comprising a protease-responsive synthetic protein device and accompanying readout, is suitable for future deployment in a rapid, low-cost, lateral flow setting. The modular protein device can readily accommodate any desired protease-response module (target protease cleavage site). This study validates the concept with three disparate proteases and applications-human infectious disease, cancer and agricultural crop infection.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":49,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
