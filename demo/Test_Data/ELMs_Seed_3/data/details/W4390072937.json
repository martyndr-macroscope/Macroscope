However, this dichotomy seems inaccurate as it ignores the locality and historical context in which cultural heritage conservation management is implemented. This study used Borobudur Temple as a case study to show how Western and Eastern paradigms are complementary. This study will examine Borobudur's cultural heritage management development from a Western perspective emphasizing materiality to an Eastern perspective emphasizing social significance. Through literature review, this study found that conservation practices have changed to emphasize Borobudur's social and cultural importance to the indigenous community. In the beginning, the conservation practice that focused on a scientific approach was useful in reconstructing the architectural structure of the temple. Then, in recent times, the conservation management that values indigenous peopleâ€™s spiritual, social, economic, and cultural ties to the Borobudur temple is considered more appropriate. This study enriches Indonesian cultural landscape management literature and shows how Western and Eastern views should be viewed as complementary rather than contradictory. It also prompts cultural geographers to consider more-than-human aspects of cultural heritage sites in conservation management.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":23,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
