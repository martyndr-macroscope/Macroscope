Beyond technocratic management in the food chain â€“ towards a new responsible professionalism in the Anthropocene","authors":["Vincent Blok"],"venue":"","year":2018,"doi":"10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_2","url":"https://doi.org/10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_2","openalex":"https://openalex.org/W2808836274","abstract":"In this contribution, we argue that three related developments provide economic, environmental and social challenges and opportunities for a new responsible professionalism in the food chain: (1) the Anthropocene; (2) the bio-based economy; (3) precision livestock farming. These three interrelated developments indicate a transition in the way we understand the role and function of the food chain on the micro-, the meso- and the macro-level. This transition can be understood in two fundamental different ways, namely either as an extension of technocratic management beyond the micro level to the meso- and macro-level of the food chain, or as a transition to a new responsible professionalism. We argue that the technocratic approach is not able to address the socio-ethical issues that come along with these three developments, and explore various competencies and abilities that constitute a new responsible professionalism in the food chain.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":14,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
