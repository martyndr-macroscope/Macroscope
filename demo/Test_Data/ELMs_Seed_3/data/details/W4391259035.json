However, the potential of SCRaMbLE to study genomic rearrangements is currently hindered, because a strain containing all 16 synthetic chromosomes is not yet available. Here, we construct SparLox83R, a yeast strain containing 83 loxPsym sites distributed across all 16 chromosomes. SCRaMbLE of SparLox83R produces versatile genome-wide genomic rearrangements, including inter-chromosomal events. Moreover, when combined with synthetic chromosomes, SCRaMbLE of hetero-diploids with SparLox83R leads to increased diversity of genomic rearrangements and relatively faster evolution of traits compared to hetero-diploids only with wild-type chromosomes. Analysis of the SCRaMbLEd strain with increased tolerance to nocodazole demonstrates that genomic rearrangements can perturb the transcriptome and 3D genome structure and consequently impact phenotypes. In summary, a genome with sparsely distributed loxPsym sites can serve as a powerful tool for studying the consequence of genomic rearrangements and accelerating strain engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":15},"references":60,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
