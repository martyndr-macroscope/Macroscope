Traditional methods of environmental remediation often fall short in addressing the complexities of contemporary pollutants. The emergence of genetic engineering technologies has opened new avenues for innovative solutions to environmental challenges. This chapter aims to explore the potential of genetically engineered bacteria as a cutting-edge tool for environmental remediation. By delving into the principles, applications, and concerns surrounding this technology, the chapter seeks to contribute to the understanding of its feasibility and sustainability. However, as we navigate the frontiers of this innovative approach, it is imperative to acknowledge and address the environmental concerns and conduct thorough risk assessments associated with the deployment of genetically engineered bacteria. Ecological impact, potential risks to human health, and ethical considerations necessitate careful consideration and mitigation strategies to ensure responsible and sustainable implementation.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
