These collaborations take place through a citizen science framework that position citizens as caring for the US nation all the while targeting migrants. The chapter sheds light on the limitations of citizen science, particularly in relation to citizenship and sovereignty, and questions its unanimous acceptance as a democratizing endeavor by examining its uncivil technopolitics in the exercise of racial violence.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":260,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
