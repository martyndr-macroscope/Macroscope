Innovation based on biomimicry is an interest way to find convergence topics between engineering and biology. This article shows how different strategies as ICTs, videos, study cases and design projects based on biomimicry can be used at the classroom as a guideline to teach biology around a final objective, achieving more interest and finding new affinities between these two fields of knowledge.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
