Cement production alone accounts for 8% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, underscoring the urgency of exploring pathways to achieve net-zero emissions in these sectors. With over 120 nations committing to net-zero targets by 2050, a comprehensive examination of emerging carbon-saving technologies is imperative. While several promising innovations are in nascent stages, rigorous life cycle assessments are essential to determine their potential for carbon reduction. Practical strategies for achieving net-zero objectives and UN sustainability goals involve embracing circular economy principles, harnessing diverse by-product sources, fostering stakeholder engagement, and fostering technological innovation. An efficiency approach that integrates advancements in materials science, alternative fuels, and sector-wide efficiencies is crucial for success. This assessment identifies promising technologies, highlights knowledge gaps, underscores the importance of further research, and offers recommendations for implementing best practices on the path to net zero.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":112,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
