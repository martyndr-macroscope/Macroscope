To discuss the extent of this problem, this chapter situates design and health paradigms in relation with each other, and discusses conceptualizations of wearability as a criterion for wearable technologies. It describes key practices in the landscape of design approaches (philosophies), and presents two innovation case studies to illustrate the key points made. Finally, it summarizes the relationship between design and health as informed by proposals for a \"fifth wave\" in public health.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":72,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
