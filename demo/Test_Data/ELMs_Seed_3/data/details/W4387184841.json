As pineapple is one of the most harvested crops in the world, the quantity of pineapple trash and its disposal methods are challenging. The composition of PL waste makes it unique to encounter the increasing demand for renewable energy and other useful products. This review is focused on the production of different biorefinery products and miscellaneous products from PL waste. The high cellulose content in PL makes it a potential feedstock for the production of different biorefinery products like bioethanol, oligosaccharides, nitrocellulose, and humic acid apart from this, waste is also useful for the production of different products like pineapple leaf fibres, fake eyelashes, organic leather, pulp and paper. Although the opportunities, future perspectives, and challenges concerning PL waste utilization to value-added goods were also addressed. It has been demonstrated that pineapple waste conversions lower waste creation, and the products produced by the conversion would promote the 'waste-to-wealth' notion.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"diamond","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":53,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
