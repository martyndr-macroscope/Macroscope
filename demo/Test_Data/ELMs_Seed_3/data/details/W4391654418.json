As our comprehension of biomineralization principles deepens, novel strategies for fabricating inorganic materials based on these principles have emerged. Researchers can also harness biomineralization strategies to tackle challenges in both materials' science and biomedical fields, demonstrating a thriving research field. This review begins by introducing the concept of biomineralization and subsequently shifts its focus to a recently discovered chemical concept: inorganic ionic oligomers and their cross‐linking. As a novel approach for constructing inorganic materials, the inorganic ionic oligomer‐based strategy finds applications in biomimetic regeneration and repair of hard tissues, such as teeth and bones. Aside from innovative methods for material fabrication, biomineralization has emerged as an alternative method for tackling biomedical challenges by integrating materials with biological organisms, facilitating advancements in biomedical fields. Emerging material‐biological integrators play a critical role in areas like vaccine improvement, cancer therapy, universal blood transfusion, and arthritis treatment. This review highlights the profound impact of biomineralization in the development and design of high‐performance materials that go beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries, potentially promoting breakthroughs in materials science, chemical biology, biomedical, and numerous other domains.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":25},"references":116,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
