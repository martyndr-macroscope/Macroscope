Cellulosic construction materials like bamboo do not form compounds with conventional flame retardants. Due to a number of circumstances, including the minimal effectiveness of the flame-retardant activity, they may thus be an unnecessary component of the substrate and simply peel off. Utilizing an additive that comes into direct contact with at least one component of the \"green building material\" will provide long-lasting flame retardancy since the flame retardant will become a structurally integral element of the substrate. The response mechanisms of various treatment approaches are also discussed in this research to ensure that non-halogenated flame retardants effectively protect sustainable building materials like wood and bamboo. This paper demonstrates how various ELECTRE approaches may be used to choose effective tactics that take into account both technical and human behavioral barriers using a typical case study inside an organization. The impact of impedance from each system subsystem is investigated to assure the dependability of the selected method. When employee participation is a deciding element in the multidimensional strategic planning problem, a comparison of a range of compensated and non-compensatory models reveals that the models may produce less. Resistance strategies; However, ELECTRE shows very reasonable sensitivity. The alternatives are Gladstone, Port Augusta, Collie and Tarong. the evaluation parameters are Construction cost, Procurement cost, Waste reduction, GHG emissions, Cement replacement and Self-consolidating. The Final Result of Net superior value and rank the Gladstone is in fourth rank, The Port Augusta is in second rank, The Collie is in third rank, The Tarong is in first rank of the Net Inferior Value and Rank the Tarong is in fourth rank, The Gladstone is in first rank, The Port Augusta is in Second rank, The Collie is in third rank.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":42,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
