Here we discuss a special subset of this material, in its fibrillated form, which is produced by aerobic microorganisms, namely, bacterial nanocellulose (BNC). BNC offers distinct advantages over plant-derived counterparts, including high purity and high degree of polymerization as well as crystallinity, strength, and water-holding capacity, among others. More remarkably, beyond classical fermentative protocols, it is possible to grow BNC on non-planar interfaces, opening new possibilities in the assembly of advanced bottom-up structures. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in the area of BNC-based biofabrication of three-dimensional (3D) designs by following solid- and soft-material templating. These methods are shown as suitable platforms to achieve bioadaptive constructs comprising highly interlocked biofilms that can be tailored with precise control over nanoscale morphological features. BNC-based biofabrication opens applications that are not possible by using traditional manufacturing routes, including direct ink writing of hydrogels. This review emphasizes the critical contributions of microbiology, colloid and surface science, as well as additive manufacturing in achieving bioadaptive designs from living matter. The future impact of BNC biofabrication is expected to take advantage of material and energy integration, residue utilization, circularity and social latitudes. Leveraging existing infrastructure, the scaleup of biofabrication routes will contribute to a new generation of advanced materials rooted in exciting synergies that combine biology, chemistry, engineering and material sciences.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":26},"references":222,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
