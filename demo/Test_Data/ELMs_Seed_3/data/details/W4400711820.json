It also discusses the rationale for transitioning to a circular economy in Hungary. Although Hungary has achieved relative decoupling of economic growth from resource and energy uses as well from waste generation, several challenges remain in the country's resource productivity, circular materials use and waste recycling. Despite structural and technological changes, materials consumption in Hungary is projected to increase significantly to 2050.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":71,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
