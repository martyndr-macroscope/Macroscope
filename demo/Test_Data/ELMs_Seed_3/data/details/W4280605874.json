Moreover, this paper analyzes the color mural pixel digitization of murals from the perspective of digitization and conducts research from a microscopic perspective. In addition, in this paper, the expansion operation is performed for particularly small cracks, and the extraction area of the crack is correspondingly increased, which reduces the bad influence on the subsequent repair due to incomplete crack extraction. Finally, this paper constructs an intelligent mural analysis system based on the improved algorithm. The experimental research results show that the color research system of Qiuci murals based on intelligent digital image processing technology proposed in this paper has good effects and can play an important role in the digital protection and digital restoration of art.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":20,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
