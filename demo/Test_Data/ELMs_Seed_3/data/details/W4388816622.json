Focusing on the grammar of scientific practices, the article establishes an epistemological basis for biomimetic technology that explores the creative interaction between technology and nature. The epistemological framework shows that bioinspired objects are autonomous with specific properties. They must be evaluated in their ability to fulfill the biomimetic promise in local applications and contexts. The article presents three results. First, it presents a philosophical framework that deepens the understanding of the relationship between sustainability and bioinspired technologies and allows for a retrospective assessment of their sustainability. Second, it points out that the scientific framework emerging from bioinspired technologies is based on collaboration, interdisciplinarity, and a holistic approach to scientific inquiry. Third, it encourages a shift in perspective from the ontology of bioinspired design to the epistemic grammar of its production.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":8},"references":44,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
