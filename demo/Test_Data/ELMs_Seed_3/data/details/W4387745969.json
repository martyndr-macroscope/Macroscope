The study focuses on stakeholder inclusion in developing the Danish Energy Agency's technology catalogues. The technology catalogues forecasts technoeconomic data up to 2050. The study reviews some well-recognised issues related to the inclusion of experts and stakeholders. The study contributes three new insights. First, a better understanding is developed of how expert and stakeholder inclusion in developing front-end inputs for energy models and scenarios aligns expectations and builds a shared understanding of detailed technoeconomic data. This shared understanding establishes a level playing field for wider public debate on visions for the future energy system. Second, a pragmatic approach is demonstrated for stakeholder inclusion in contexts – such as developing technology catalogues – with limited resources and only a few actors available for consultation. Third, the paper presents the argument that the concept of technocracy can bring useful insights for analysing expert and stakeholder inclusion in longterm energy planning.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":52,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
