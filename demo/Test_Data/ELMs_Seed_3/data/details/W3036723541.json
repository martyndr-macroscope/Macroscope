Such a perspective is integrated with postnatural environmentalism and ecofeminist frameworks. By offering a new conceptualization of artifacts, it aims to transform the patterns of how humans deal with artifacts, and thereby limit consumerism, which should contribute to achieving pro-environmental goals.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":42,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
