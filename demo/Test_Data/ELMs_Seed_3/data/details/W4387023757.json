Through a comprehensive literature review, valuable information and data were gathered to reflect upon and gain essential knowledge about textile biomaterials. The study aims to address the question of what new skills designers need to acquire in order to effectively select these materials for their projects. Subsequently, by studying and characterising various materials such as biopolymers from the polyester group, natural fibres and next-generation materials, a broader, more robust and clearer understanding of this emerging materiality was achieved. In conjunction with the principles of Design for Sustainability, the study further integrates the concepts of circular economy and bioeconomy, encompassing the extended product life cycle, material flows, dematerialization (recycling and reuse) and judicious use of raw materials. This research has identified critical linkages between material attributes that can significantly influence material selection in the design of a product development process. These insights are pivotal in guiding designers towards informed and pragmatic decision-making, facilitating sustainable and forward-thinking design practices for textile biomaterials. Overall, this article offers valuable insights and practical guidance for designers seeking to incorporate sustainable biomaterials in their projects, thus fostering a more environmentally conscious and innovative approach to textile product development.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":7},"references":53,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
