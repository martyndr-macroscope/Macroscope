This paper presents an explorative study that taps into a relatively unexplored potential of fungi in biodesign, namely, \"to heal\" living and non-living mycelium-based materials. When still alive, the fungus can fill in the material substrate with a network of thread-like roots called mycelium. By revisiting the concept of the patch and mend, we can repair and reappropriate mycelium-based materials and extend their lifetime. By leveraging the livingness of fungi, our material-driven explorations demonstrate unique aesthetic expressions in the healed mycelium-based samples toward the revival of daily repair practices.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":2},"references":22,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
