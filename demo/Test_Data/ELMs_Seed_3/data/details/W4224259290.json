Despite the successes and impact of these educational programs, and despite the emergence and growth in recent decades of youth-led issues-based movements worldwide, there have been scarce opportunities for young people to have a voice in national and global networks for action on Antarctica. Furthermore, both Antarctic decision-makers and academia have not paid a great deal of attention to youth participation in Antarctic affairs. Drawing on a youth expedition to King George Island in February 2020, the authors designed the Antarctic Youth Coalition as an experiment in youth participation. As a result of the formation of the Antarctic Youth Coalition across five Antarctic gateway cities, we proposed that AYC to provides conceptual and practical platforms for a deeper interrogation of youth participation in Antarctic political, social, economic and environmental matters of concern. This article highlights sustained and active engagement with Antarctic youth projects and the role that young people can play in Antarctic cultural diplomacy.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":30,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
