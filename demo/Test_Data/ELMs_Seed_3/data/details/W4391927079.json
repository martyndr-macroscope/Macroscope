Sustainable design is evolving towards discourses that stress the relevance of local interventions and the diverse contribution native cultures can give in shaping post-developed societies. This paper addresses the topic of endemic material design in decentralised areas through Material Driven Design experience by analysing the project called Viral Nature, a material research and design of a composite material able to host vegetal life and attract biodiversity. Originally formulated as a potential design intervention against soil degradation and desertification, nonetheless, the exposure of Viral Nature artefacts to the public showed its potential to be employed as a communicative medium to foster human feelings of environmental empathy. A case study to display a design trend leading toward resistant practices of biointegrated design, to investigate and hypothesise how endemic DIY-Material Design strategies enhance the functionality of the material experience and encourage a change of paradigm towards alternative solutions for the pluriverse.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"diamond","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":14,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
