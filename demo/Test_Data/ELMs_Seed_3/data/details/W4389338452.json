Unfortunately, science communication has not been carried out successfully. Most scientists can communicate well among or to their colleagues; however, communicating outwardly to important stakeholders such as the public, government, industry, educators, or even scientists outside of their field can be problematic. The lack of effective science communication was exemplified during the pandemic. This chapter will focus on the importance of improving science communication skills and the model utilized at Xavier University of Louisiana (XULA) to enhance effective scientific communication. This model is composed of five key components necessary to enhance science communication skills among faculty (STEM and n-STEM), staff, and students.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":38,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
