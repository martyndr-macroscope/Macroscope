The underlying molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood and to date no curative treatments are available. In this PhD project, a humanized mouse model was, for the first time, explored as drug response tool, using new and already clinically approved targeted treatments against cancer bone metastasis. The outcomes and observations presented, show that further humanization of the model will allow for the in-depth dissection of molecular differences between the murine and human bone-microenvironment in the context of drug response.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":252,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
