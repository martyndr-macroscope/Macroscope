The present article contributes to such dialogue, first by reconstructing the relation between Actor-Network Theory and ‘aesthetic studies’ and then by proposing an analytical model enabling the description of ‘aesthetic practices’, by considering artifacts as bodies. Such model draws on Latour’s (2004) reflection about bodies, on Ingold’s (2007) one about materials and especially on Fontanille’s (2004) semiotics of the body. To illustrate the relevance of the model, the article offers a description-analysis of the development of a prototype of an electronic circuit designed for a data glove.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"diamond","network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":3},"references":95,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
