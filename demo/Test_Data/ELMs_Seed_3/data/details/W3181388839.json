They are so embedded in language and thinking that we are often unaware of their impact, despite the crucial role of metaphors in communication, learning and creating meaning from experiences. A deeper understanding of how to recognize and work with client-generated and counselor-generated metaphors has great potential as an addition to the genetic counseling 'tool-box'. Here, we draw on studies from related health and psychotherapy fields to discuss how working purposefully with metaphors may offer a powerful way to enhance communication within a reciprocally engaged client-counselor relationship. Metaphors present ways to explain complex genetic concepts in a personally meaningful form, to gain a deeper understanding of client's experiences and emotions, to assist processing of experiences, emotions, and concepts, and to assist client and counselor to access and reflect on subconscious emotions, self-concept, and motivations. In addition, working with metaphors has been shown to facilitate coping and action. This paper sets the scene for why and how genetic counselors can utilize client-generated and counselor-generated metaphors purposefully in all areas of practice, including enhancing the therapeutic interaction with clients, as well as in supervision, training, cultural competence, and shaping of societal attitudes toward genetics.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":10},"references":43,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
