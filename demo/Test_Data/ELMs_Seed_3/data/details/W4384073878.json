Various studies have shown that vegan leather alternatives are particularly suitable because they mimic the properties of real leather, and the qualities of the bio-based materials combined with textile substrates are relatively close to real leather. In addition, cactus plants require less water and can completely replace real leather. The use of cactus as a source of sustainable textiles and leather offers numerous environmental benefits. This is due to the fact that harvesting the cactus does not harm the plant or its roots, allowing it to keep growing and sequestering carbon dioxide. This paper discusses sustainable materials based on cactus species that can replace leather products, for example, and explores the development of bio-based textiles in the near future.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":8},"references":31,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
