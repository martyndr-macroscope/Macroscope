Many in the disability rights movement have questioned the desire to use prenatal or genetic testing to diminish the extent of disability within society. They note that this desire runs counter to our society’s stated intention to treat persons with disabilities without discrimination, and that it is driven by an overly pessimistic view of disability and its potential adverse impact on families. These issues are particularly difficult, or course, since there indeed are certain disability conditions (e.g., Tay–Sachs syndrome) that have an extraordinarily negative impact on individuals and families. The minority group model of disability will be considered in contrast to the medical model, from which the social work profession has traditionally operated.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":214,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
