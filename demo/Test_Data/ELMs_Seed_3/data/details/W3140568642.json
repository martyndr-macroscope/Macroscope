A new understanding of non‐classical nucleation is introduced, which highlights the formation of ionic clusters during the early mineral formation. This discovery directs to a new chemical concept of inorganic ionic oligomers and their crosslinking. Different from the conventional syntheses of inorganic materials, the inorganic ionic oligomers can be used as the conformable precursors to achieve moldable constructions, which arises from a fusion of classic inorganic and polymer chemistry by sharing the same process for the manufacture of materials. By using the inorganic oligomers, the biomimetic regenerations/ repairs of hard tissues such as tooth enamel and bone can be realized. And the advanced artificial materials superior over biological ones can be developed by inorganic‐organic co‐polymerization. Moreover, biomineralization is a tool for the integration of materials and biological organism. Our attempts demonstrate that the rationally designed materials‐biologicals can contribute to vaccine improvement, universal blood transfusion, and cancer treatment, etc . They follow a transformation of biomineralization study from biomimetic synthesis of materials to biomimetic modification of organisms and furthermore, start an understanding of chemical biological regulation by materials. What is the most favorite and original chemistry developed in your research group? The discovery of ionic oligomers and their crosslinking following a new concept of inorganic ionic polymerization. How do you get into this specific field? Could you please share some experiences with our readers? I got into the field of biomineralization when I was a graduate student. A challenge in biomineralization community is how we can achieve a moldable construction of inorganic materials (biominerals). Fortunately, we observed the formation of ultrasmall ion aggregates at the early nucleation strategy. This finding subsequently directed to our exploration of ionic oligomers and the most important key was a new start of this inorganic study upon a view of polymer chemistry. How do you supervise your students? I keep on asking my students two questions: 1) What unsolvable problem can you solve for our society by your study? 2) What new understanding can you contribute to our scientific community by your study? What is the most important personality for scientific research? Ready to accept challenge, persist and never give up. What are your hobbies? What's your favorite book(s)? I like travel since I can feel different culture and learn many different ideas in the travelling. I prefer history books since I can “earn” much valuable experience in the reading. How do you keep balance between research and family? Working effectively in weekday and relaxing completely in weekend. Who influences you mostly in your life? The group of my friends and colleagues. I learn lots to improve myself under their help and criticisms. Could you please give us some advices on improving Chinese Journal of Chemistry? To induce the best chemical research in China, beginning from review papers but finally moving to the top research papers.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":21},"references":95,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
