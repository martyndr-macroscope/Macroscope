By deliberately adopting an open and ambiguous idea of what we mean by 'nature', we hope to embrace diverse kinds of more-than-human entanglements, including (but not only): farming, companion species, microbiomes, body ecologies, forests and other large-scale landscapes (e.g. oceans), or cohabitation in houses. We argue for the importance of taking such an open-ended perspective, to embrace all possible relevant vectors of nature-related design: multispecies, cohabitation, posthuman sustainability, posthuman care… The workshop is set as a as a platform for shared methodological reflection through the lenses of a more-than-human approach to posthuman research. It will primarily be in-person, given our aim of bringing researchers together and co-experiencing each others' methods and techniques.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":3},"references":14,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
