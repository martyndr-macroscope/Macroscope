The printed image is the'イ(I)' first displayed on a television CRT display by Kenjiro Takayanagi in 1926. Unlike conventional printed materials, this image has a temporal development. The luminous image gradually glows, then deteriorates and vanishes as the luminous bacteria undergo growth and die.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":10,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
