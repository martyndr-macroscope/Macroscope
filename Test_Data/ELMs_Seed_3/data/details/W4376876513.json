In doing so, we survey how geographers and social scientists have sought to think and communicate memory of nuclear things through three specific modes: the archival, the aesthetic, and the speculative. Our central argument is that nuclear memory provides a theoretical orientation for geographers to engage with alternative possibilities for thinking nuclear waste futures besides anthropocentric notions of common sense.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":8},"references":112,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
