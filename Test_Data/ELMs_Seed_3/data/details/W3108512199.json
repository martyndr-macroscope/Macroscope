Living biological materials are expected to have the potential to overcome the depletion of non-renewable resources. Through bio-design and biophilic design in the urban environment, designers apply living systems as appropriate solutions to everyday designs. This paper aims to classify the biological materials and the sense of ownership towards biological materials embedded in products in terms of a) Function, b) Aesthetic and Semantic, and c) Emotion and Experience. A survey was conducted from 173 respondents through an online questionnaire. Keywords: biological materials; biophilic design; product designs; purposes and ownership eISSN: 2398-4287© 2020.
