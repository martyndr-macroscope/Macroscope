Bacterial nanocellulose becomes stiff and brittle when dried, so attempts have been made to plasticise this material so that BNC can be used in industry. The research presented here focuses on the ecological modification of bacterial nanocellulose with vegetable oils such as rapeseed oil, linseed oil, and grape seed oil. The effect of compatibilisers of a natural origin on the plasticisation process of BNC, such as chlorophyll, curcumin, and L-glutamine, was also evaluated. BNC samples were modified with rapeseed, linseed, and grapeseed oils, as well as mixtures of each of these oils with the previously mentioned additives. The modification was carried out by passing the oil, or oil mixture, through the BNC using vacuum filtration, where the BNC acted as a filter. The following tests were performed to determine the effect of the modification on the BNC: FTIR spectroscopic analysis, contact angle measurements, and static mechanical analysis. As a result of the modification, the BNC was plasticised. Rapeseed oil proved to be the best for this purpose, with the help of which a material with good strength and elasticity was obtained.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":55,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
