Therefore, a novel Janus-nanomicelles photocatalyst is developed using carbazole (Cz) as the donor unit, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxydiimide (PDI) with long-excited state as the acceptor unit and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the hydrophilic segment through ROMP polymerization. After optimizing the ratio, Cz19-PDI18-PEG10 rapidly adsorbs bisphenol A (BPA) within 10 s through π-π interaction, hydrogen-bonding interaction, and hydrophobic interaction between BPA and hydrophobic blocks when exposed to aqueous humor and efficiently photodegrades BPA (50 ppm) within 120 min for water purification purposes due to its long-lived charge separation state and achieving the highest reported efficiency so far. Mechanistic studies have shown that this excellent performance of Cz19-PDI18-PEG10 can be attributed to synergistic interactions between highly efficient adsorption capacity and long-lived charge separation states during photocatalysis. This novel Janus-nanomicelles design strategy holds promise as an effective candidate for water purification.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":57,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
