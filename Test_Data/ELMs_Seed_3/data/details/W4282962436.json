This paper asks what it means to dwell and design in such times and proposes an ethics for biodesign: which employs the insights and tools of the biotechnological age to generate new, ecologically beneficial forms of design, where microbes are the new \"workhorses.\" Exemplified in the Living Architecture, ALICE and IM-CITY projects—these biodesign case studies explore how working with microbes can help us contribute significantly to the (re)enlivening of the world by establishing a culture of life—based on mutual thriving.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":14,"cited_by_count":13},"references":45,"networkCitations":14,"seed":false}
