Among them, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii is known to be halotolerant, osmotolerant, petite negative, and poorly Crabtree positive. These traits and the high fermentative vigour make this species very appealing for industrial and food applications. Nevertheless, the biotechnological exploitation of Z. rouxii has been biased by the low availability of genetic engineering tools and the recalcitrance of this yeast towards the most conventional transformation procedures. Centromeric and episomal Z. rouxii plasmids have been successfully constructed with prototrophic markers, which limited their usage to auxotrophic strains, mainly derived from the Z. rouxii haploid type strain Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) 732T . By contrast, the majority of industrially promising Z. rouxii yeasts are prototrophic and allodiploid/aneuploid strains. In order to expand the genetic tools for manipulating these strains, we developed two centromeric and two episomal vectors harbouring KanMXR and ClonNATR as dominant drug resistance markers, respectively. We also constructed the plasmid pGRCRE that allows the Cre recombinase-mediated marker recycling during multiple gene deletions. As proof of concept, pGRCRE was successfully used to rescue the kanMX-loxP module in Z. rouxii ATCC 42981 G418-resistant mutants previously constructed by replacing the MATαP expression locus with the loxP-kanMX-loxP cassette.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":5},"references":56,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
