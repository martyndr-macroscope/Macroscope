However, challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration, scalability and commercialization have slowed its widespread adoption and integration into industry applications such as fashion and textiles. This study addresses the gap in understanding how bacterial cellulose is perceived, developed, and utilized across scientific and design disciplines. Through 20 semi-structured interviews with scientists and designers around the world, this paper explores the following themes: (1) the human-living material relationship spectrum, which highlights the distinct ways science and design stakeholders interact with bacterial cellulose as a living material; (2) perceptions of a living material made from bacteria; and (3) bacterial cellulose’s potential as a programmable biomaterial. Additionally, we employ Bruno Latour’s Actor-Network Theory to map the complex network of human and non-human actors shaping bacterial cellulose’s trajectory, identifying critical factors such as consumer acceptance, interdisciplinary collaboration, and material culture. By bridging perspectives from science and design, this study offers actionable insights into bacterial cellulose’s future as a sustainable and programmable engineered living material, guiding its responsible development and broader adoption across industries.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":45,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
