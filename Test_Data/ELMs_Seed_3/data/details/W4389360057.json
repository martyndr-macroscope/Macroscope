The novel Circular City framework on the mainstreaming of nature-based solutions for the enhancement of urban resource management, which was developed within the COST Action CA17133, is presented. Urban circularity challenges addressed by nature-based solutions are assessed in the built environment following three different levels of implementation—i.e., green building materials, systems for the greening of buildings envelope, and green building sites as vegetated open spaces and water-sensitively designed. Considering the possibilities of implementing nature-based solutions in the built environment, we also highlight the circularity processes that can take place through the integration of nature-based solutions at some or all of the proposed scales towards the achievement of at least one of the seven urban circularity challenges. A collection of representative actual case studies exemplifying the development and implementation of nature-based solutions towards circular cities is also included.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":4},"references":22,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
