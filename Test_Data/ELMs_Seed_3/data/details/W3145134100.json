Biodesign has the potential to shift interactive computational systems from using purely digital components to systems that integrate living organisms. However, there is a lack of understanding of biodesign and how it advances HCI. We present a review of 41 papers published in ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore digital library and the Design and Applied Arts Index. We found that existing literature describes aspects of biodesign theory, design processes and artifacts, and educational environments, but not holistically. Based on the findings, we define biodesign as the application of the bioaffordances of an organism. We contribute the Bio-Inquiry model: a methodology connecting user-centered, scientific and critical inquiries to inform the design of interactive artifacts. We discuss the opportunities at the intersection of biodesign and HCI to consider the nature of future technologies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":12,"cited_by_count":23},"references":77,"networkCitations":12,"seed":false}
