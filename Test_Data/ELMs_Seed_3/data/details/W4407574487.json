The mechanism of nano‐SiO 2 bioinspired grafted BF was analyzed through micro‐morphology, functional group changes, and elemental composition tests. The cohesive characteristics of nano‐SiO 2 bioinspired grafting BF with asphalt were investigated using direct tension tests and surface energy theory. The results showed that after BF soaking in 3 mol/L HCl solution (BF HCl ), nano‐SiO 2 grafting BF (SiO 2 ‐BF HCl ) has good wettability with asphalt. Alkali metal ions on the surface of BF HCl were ion exchanged with H + in the HCl solution, forming new Si‐OH bonds and grafting more SiO 2 . Compared with the original BF reinforced asphalt, the maximum tensile force and ductility of nano‐SiO 2 grafting BF reinforced asphalt both increased, and the wetting angle with asphalt droplets was SiO 2 ‐BF HCl &gt; SiO 2 ‐BF NaOH &gt; SiO 2 ‐BF &gt; original BF. Based on the surface energy theory, the cohesion functions of SiO 2 ‐BF, SiO 2 ‐BF NaOH , and SiO 2 ‐BF HCl with asphalt were improved by 2.8%, 7.4%, and 11.6%, respectively, compared to that of the original BF.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
