Here, we describe a generic approach for robust biocontainment of budding yeast dependent on unAA. By understanding escape mechanisms, we specifically optimize our strategies by introducing designed \"immunity\" to the generation of amber-suppressor tRNAs and developing the transcriptional- and translational-based biocontainment switch. We further develop a fitness-oriented screening method to easily obtain multiplex safeguard strains that exhibit robust growth and undetectable escape frequency (<~10","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":18},"references":71,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
