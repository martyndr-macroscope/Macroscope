As a result, there is a great deal of interest in cartilage repair and recovery of joint function due to the aging population and the increasing frequency of cartilage degradation and osteoarthritis. Thus, the search for better and more efficient strategies to regenerate articular cartilage to repair the joints in patients with osteoarthritis is a critical motivation. Biomaterials, which are made of natural or synthetic polymers, or a mixture of the two, serve as a scaffold for tissue regeneration. Cartilage tissue engineering (TE) seeks to develop a treatment that can effectively repair damaged AC caused by trauma or disease. In cartilage TE, scaffolds that provide a 3D environment like native articular cartilage for cells to proliferate, attach, and hence ensure tissue regeneration success are needed. For optimal cell activities, which is associated with proper cartilage regeneration, these scaffolds must meet all necessary criteria, including adequate architectural, physicochemical, and biological properties. This study briefly explores the evolution of scaffolds constructed of synthetic polymers and hybrid materials for cartilage tissue engineering. Initially, general information on AC is presented, as well as a review of medical approaches to treating cartilage injuries or disease. Following that, the requirements for scaffolds in tissue regeneration, specific materials, and techniques for producing them are briefly discussed.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":15},"references":239,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
