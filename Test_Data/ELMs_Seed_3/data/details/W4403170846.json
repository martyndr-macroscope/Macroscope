Based on the content and characteristics of Li Zehou’s aesthetics theory, the article describes the innovative application of emerging technology in academic communication, constructs the academic field of Li Zehou’s aesthetics theory on the basis of Bourdieu’s field theory, and designs the framework of the interactive academic field by combining with emerging technology. Relying on Li Zehou’s interactive academic field for the construction of a multi-layer innovation network model and providing relevant quantitative methods for interactive academic field network metrics. The dataset is constructed with the relevant literature of Li Zehou’s aesthetics theory from 2005 to 2022 as the search target, and the network density, central potential, clustering coefficients, and path lengths of the interactive field are analyzed, and the evolution characteristics of the multilayer field network are explored. The cross-border innovation multilayer network density of the interactive field of Li Zehou’s aesthetic thought fluctuates around 0.092, approaching the mean value of central potential up to 65.76%, and the average clustering coefficient fluctuates in the range of [0.25,0.35]. The cooperative sub-network and the technology sub-network have smaller path lengths with larger clustering coefficients, indicating small-worldness. The interactive academic field combining emerging technologies can promote the widespread dissemination of Li Zehou’s aesthetic ideas.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":18,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
