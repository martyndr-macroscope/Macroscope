It incorporates living organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants and algae into products and manufacturing processes. This approach harnesses the organismsâ€™ potential, including their metabolic activities, growth, stimuli responses, reproductive capabilities, and relationships with other life forms, to create living-like design outcomes. Indigenous communities have a historical connection to living systems in agriculture, wine making and traditional crafts, offering valuable insights. This paper presents a real-life case study of the Kotpad craft community in Odisha, India, highlighting their challenges. As indigenous communities like the Mirigan craftsmen face pressure to integrate into the mainstream economy, there is a risk of losing their connection with nature, traditional knowledge, and unique identity. The paper envisions the possibility of Biodesign applications in indigenous craft practices and explores hypothetical approaches to problem-solving by application of Synthetic Biology to indigenous crafts preservation. It critically analyzes the advantages, disadvantages, ethical considerations and socio-economic-cultural implications for the community.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":32,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
