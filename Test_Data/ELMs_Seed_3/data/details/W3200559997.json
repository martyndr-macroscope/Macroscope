Is it ever acceptable to destroy an ecosystem if one agrees to restore it later? Does pristine, wild nature have a value that restored nature does not? Who should be the primary beneficiary of restoration: the ecosystem or its human stakeholders? And can restoration give rise to an environmental ethic beyond the traditional one of mere preservation? Situating the ethics of river restoration with respect to wider ethical debates in the field of ecological restoration, I consider how various important attributes of rivers, in particular their connectedness to other ecosystems and their importance as sites for human habitation and activity, give rise to ethical questions not present in the paradigmatic examples of ecological restoration considered in the mainstream philosophical literature. This in turn leads to the proposal for a new approach to river restoration based on the theoretical framework of biomimicry, \"imitationism,\" which may be favorably contrasted with other philosophical and theoretical frameworks, including preservationism, restorationism, and actor network theory.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":5},"references":49,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
