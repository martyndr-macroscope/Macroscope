It focuses on the case of blood pressure self-monitoring, understanding this as a form of patient participation at the level of individual care. Drawing and expanding on the work of Marres and Wynne and their notions of material participation and of uninvited engagement, we examine how patients’ home blood pressure self-monitoring is incorporated into clinical care, how the materials of blood pressure self-monitoring mediate participation and how we might characterise the practices of participation found within everyday clinical care. Our analysis makes new conceptual links, suggesting that, in this context, invited participation appears to align with participation made easy, while uninvited participation involves more invested, more engaged participation. We offer two further developments of these concepts. First, we trouble characterisations of invited and uninvited participation as distinct and separate, observing movement between these. Second, through applying the logics of material participation in a new context, everyday clinical practice, we suggest that the logic of participation made easy might be extended beyond lay people, to apply to professionals as well. Our analysis illustrates how materials are mobilised to facilitate invited and uninvited participation within the context of the on-going asymmetries in doctor patient relationships.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":36,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
