With digital tools, farmers can make data-driven decisions that optimize their crops' growth and reduce waste. One of the key components of digital agriculture is the use of sensors and other monitoring devices to gather data about the health and development of crops. This information is then analyzed using advanced software algorithms to provide insights into the most efficient ways to manage irrigation, fertilizer application, pest control, and other critical aspects of agriculture. The result is a more precise, efficient, and sustainable agricultural production process. Another important aspect of digital agriculture is using drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles to survey fields and monitor crop growth. These tools provide farmers with real-time data about the health and progress of their crops, allowing them to make informed decisions about optimizing their production processes. In addition to these technological advancements, digital agriculture uses big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to help farmers make more informed decisions. With the help of AI, farmers can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends relevant to their crops and farming operations. Despite these benefits, there are also some challenges associated with digital agriculture. In this sense, this paper aims to analyze the main components of Digital Agriculture and the challenges faced by this approach in current agricultural practices.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":137,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
