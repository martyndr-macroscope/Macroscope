The physicochemical properties, amino acid profiles, bioactive components, and antioxidant properties of raw and sterilized WB were compared with those of WB fermented with five different LAB strains. The highest level of BCAAs, isoleucine (Ile; 2.557 ± 0.05 mg/100 g), leucine (Leu; 7.703 ± 0.40 mg/100 g), and valine (Val; 7.207 ± 0.37 mg/100 g), was displayed in the WB fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus (L.A WB). In addition, L.A WB showed the highest amount of total phenolic and flavonoid contents (2.80 mg GAE/g and 1.01 mg CE/g, respectively), and the highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (9.88 mM TE/g). Statistical analysis clearly revealed that L.A WB presented the highest abundance of branched chain amino acids as well as bioactive components. Overall, this study distinctly implemented the possibility of fermented WB with enhanced BCAAs for application in future functional food through experimental and statistical observations.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":16},"references":35,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
