In this work, the authors present some parts of the results of their research and investigation. The experimental research of advanced materials is a constantly evolving field, concerning the need to respond to increasingly advanced technical performance, even in the construction sector and specifically for Building Envelopes. In this context, the contribution concerns ongoing experimental research, which investigates the dynamic behavior of non-structural elements of the Facade subjected to the action of the earthquake. The results of the investigations conducted so far aim to increase innovation in the field of advanced materials for extreme applications, for the constraints on the implementation of the technologies (increasing element sizes, higher mechanical strengths, better performance), exploiting the superelastic effect (SE) and the shape memory effect (SME). Thus, it seems clear that the potential of the two unique properties for Facade Design applications is a valuable tool for investigating dynamic behaviors that exist in nature as well.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":19,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
