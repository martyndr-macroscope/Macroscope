However, in addition to their importance, textiles are also responsible for various types of environmental pollution along the entire textile chain, from production, transport and trade to daily use to their end-of-life. Here we provide a brief overview of current approaches to establishing R principles in the textile industry in order to transform the recent linear structures into a circular economy and show in which areas there is a particular need for research and action.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"diamond","network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":90,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
