They offer transformative possibilities not only for improving the production of materials they naturally produce, but also for the production of non-native and even new-to-nature materials. However, despite these promising applications, the full potential of fungi remains untapped mainly due to limitations in our ability to control and optimize their complex biological systems. This review focuses on developments that address these challenges, with specific emphasis on fungal-derived rigid and flexible materials. To achieve this goal, the application of synthetic biology tools—such as programmable regulators, CRISPR-based genome editing, and combinatorial pathway optimization—in engineering fungal strains is highlighted, and how external environmental parameters can be tuned to influence material properties is discussed. This review positions filamentous fungi as promising platforms for sustainable bio-based technologies, contributing to a more sustainable future across various sectors.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":0},"references":99,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
