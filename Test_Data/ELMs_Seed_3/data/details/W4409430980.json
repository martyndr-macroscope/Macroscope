The rapid pace of technological advancement has led to increased consumption of electronic devices, many of which are challenging and costly to recycle efficiently. Insufficient infrastructure for e-waste recycling has resulted in large quantities being exported to countries with minimal waste management capabilities. In these regions, waste is often processed manually, exposing workers to hazardous materials and toxic elements commonly found in electronic components, leading to serious health risks. E-waste consists primarily of fibrous composite materials and plastics mixed with valuable metals and reusable components. While metals are often recovered, the remaining materials are typically discarded, contributing to significant environmental harm. Addressing e-waste challenges requires more than just technological solutions. In the United States, limited policies promote large-scale reuse and recycling practices, particularly among corporations. To build a sustainable approach, a combination of next-generation, cost-effective chemical recycling technologies and forward-thinking policy reforms will be essential for the effective management and reduction of e-waste. This paper explores the global generation and composition of e-waste, highlighting its environmental and health impacts due to improper handling and disposal. It reviews current and emerging recycling technologies while examining the challenges and opportunities in e-waste management. Finally, it discusses sustainable solutions and future directions for improving e-waste recycling through innovative technologies and policy reforms, concluding with recommendations for a circular economy approach.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":72,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
