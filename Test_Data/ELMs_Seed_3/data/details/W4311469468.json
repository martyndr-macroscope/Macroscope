While most social work professionals will not be employed as genetic counselors, all need to have a basic understanding of prenatal testing procedures and the difficult decisions that prospective parents may have to make, and this is also discussed. These decisions, moreover, are made within the context of our biopsychosocial view of disability and the perceived future prospects and impact on the family of persons with disabilities. These issues give rise to a number of race- and class-based implications, which are also discussed. Innovations in biogenetics, such as CRISPR and the potential of genetic enhancement procedures, are briefly introduced, as well as the deployment of eugenic policies internationally.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":214,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
