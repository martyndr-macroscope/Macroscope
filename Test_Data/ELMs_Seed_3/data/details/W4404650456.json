Microalgae possess unique capabilities that make them an attractive feedstock for biofuel production, including their ability to capture and sequester carbon dioxide, their efficient use of water and land resources, and the potential for them to utilize waste streams as nutrient sources. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the environmental and economic implications of microalgae‐derived fuels, highlighting the key benefits and remaining challenges. The integration of synthetic biology to enhance microalgae strains, optimize cultivation and processing, and diversify revenue streams is explored as a means to address the economic barriers to large‐scale commercialization. As research and development in this field continue to progress, the future prospects of microalgae‐based biofuels are discussed, underscoring their potential to reshape the global energy landscape towards a more sustainable and economically viable future.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":8},"references":56,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
