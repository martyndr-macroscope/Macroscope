Despite its potential, Bio Design has received little attention within design studies. This paper focuses on synthetic biology's role in Bio Design, applying engineering principles to biology. It critiques the limited framework provided by traditional design methodologies for engaging with biological systems' unique characteristics. Utilizing Oxman's digital design framework, we propose a schematic conceptual model for Bio Design. This model emphasizes the collaborative interplay between genetic and environmental factors and acknowledges the inherent agency within biological systems. Through this, we argue for a re-evaluation of design processes that respects the complex, emergent nature of biology as a design medium.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":1},"references":59,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
