It promises answers to some of the grand challenges society is facing: worsening climate crisis, insufficient food supplies for ever growing populations, and many persisting infectious and genetic diseases. While many challenges remain unaddressed, after almost two decades since its inception a number of products created by engineered biology are starting to reach the public. European scientists and entrepreneurs have been participating in delivering on the promises of synthetic biology. Associations like the European Synthetic Biology Society (EUSynBioS) play a key role in disseminating advances in the field, connecting like-minded people and promoting scientific development. In this perspective article, we review the current landscape of the synthetic biology community in Europe, discussing the state of related academic research and industry. We also discuss how EUSynBioS has helped to build bridges between professionals across the continent.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":12},"references":32,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
