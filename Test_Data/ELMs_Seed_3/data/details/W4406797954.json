In this context, the study examines the effects of digital technology, as reflected by the digital economy and society index (DESI), on key agricultural performance metrics, including agricultural output and real labor productivity per person. The paper develops a strong analytical method for quantifying these associations using predictive models, such as exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and artificial neural networks. The method fully illustrates how economic and technological components interact, including labor productivity, agricultural output, and GDP per capita. The results demonstrate that digital technologies significantly impact agricultural output and labor productivity. These findings illustrate the importance of digital transformation in modernizing and improving agriculture’s overall efficacy. The study’s conclusion highlights the necessity of integrating digital technology into agricultural policy to address productivity problems and nurture sustainable growth in the sector.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":4},"references":104,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
