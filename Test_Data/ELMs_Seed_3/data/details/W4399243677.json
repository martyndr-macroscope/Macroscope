However, currently, only a limited number of fungal strains, typically Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus, are fully characterized and utilized for design practices, and many local strains with the potential to rival traditional and biodegradable materials remain unexplored. This study aims to unlock accessible and local supply chain potentials for mycelium in biodesign, addressing several key questions: How can mycelium biodesign be made more accessible to designers with limited background in mycology? How can local biological waste be effectively mapped? How can mycelium spawn be locally sourced beyond commercial producers? and, what is the role of mycologists and designers in creating a symbiotic community to support the development of local material streams? To address these inquiries, this paper uses New York City (NY, USA) as a case study to develop a practical methodology for initiating an accessible mycelium-based design practice. The approach showcased in the paper emphasizes the localization of resources and stakeholders, involving the mapping of online suppliers, mushroom farms, cultivation groups, urban agriculture organizations, and community gardens for their mycelium spawn and biological substrate sources. Long term, this research aims to comprehend the movement of mycelium matter as a vital force for scaling up biodesign, while facilitating the development of novel, bespoke, and more accessible natural materials.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"green","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":5,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
