This chapter contrasts the focus on difference in the ontological turn with a focus on similarity in cognitive anthropology and cognitive science more broadly. Mobilizing debates in philosophy of science, this chapter develops an alternative model of partially overlapping ontologies that demonstrates how complex relations between ontologies emerge from both similarities and differences in representational needs and relational practices of actors. The second part of the chapter addresses relations between ontologies through community perspectives, from farmers’ ontologies of agricultural pests to seed classifications to fish taxonomies to the Amerindian forest entity Caipora. This research shows how ontological diversity in the communities requires a pluralist understanding of representations and relations that become expressed through diverse ontologies.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":560,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
