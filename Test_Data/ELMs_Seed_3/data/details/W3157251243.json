These processes also affect the urban environment. High-tech urban clusters, accumulating significant scientific potential, through the opening of science art laboratories, in which collaborative projects of researchers and artists are carried out, stimulate the clusters development, using the intuitive principles of art. This article analyzes the examples of a successfully functioning Ljudmila laboratory in Ljubljana, the International Synthetic Aesthetics project, the My Neighborhood social networking project, and describes the case of the restoration of a historic elm tree in Biscarrosse, France. According to the results of the study, the authors conclude that cooperation between scientists and people of creative professions can turn out to be a significant vector for the development of not only science and art, but also social life in the cities where the practice of Science Art is used.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":9,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
