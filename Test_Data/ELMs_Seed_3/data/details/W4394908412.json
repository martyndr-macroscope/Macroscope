This scenario represents a great challenge since updated literature shows that, as a trend, there is a lack of political will and phenomena such as social denial. As a result, it was necessary to achieve a critical examination of the literature regarding actions that support climate change awareness from a sustainable approach. A narrative review of relevant sources was carried out, the main results of which point to the fact that the income participation variable since 1820 is concentrated at 10 percent in the richest social classes, who have consistently received 50 percent of all income. Furthermore, it could be seen that addressing climate change, as a process, is subject to the study of its causes and the transformation of the ecosystem from more sustainable practices oriented towards human and non-human well-being. The study allowed us to conclude that, to achieve this purpose, innovative capabilities must be promoted that promote technological entrepreneurship through innovation and development alternatives","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":65,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
