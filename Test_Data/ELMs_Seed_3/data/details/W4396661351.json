This has driven the creation of vast quantities of data and led to deep concerns about the politics of digital data and computational methods. To date, critical investigation of these concerns has focused on large commercial platforms built on top of the Web, and their use of machine learning methods. Meanwhile, less attention has been paid to the underlying design and protocols of Web itself, and how these might be implicated in the very same process and concerns. We explore ongoing endeavors to transform the Web from a library of documents intended for humans to a “semantic Web” using symbolic artificial intelligence to enable machine reasoning across multiple heterogenous data sources. In principle, this would transform the production and circulation of knowledge at Web scale. We present the findings from an experimental, interdisciplinary study exploring the epistemological politics and sociomaterial practices involved in situated accomplishment of the semantic Web. Our findings have consequences for the future of the Web and the future of Web-based platforms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":28,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
