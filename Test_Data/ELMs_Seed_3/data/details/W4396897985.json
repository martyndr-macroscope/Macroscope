In Guatemala, this role extends to encompassing Biodesign education and the promotion of biomaterials for sustainable product innovation. Consequently, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala has established a specialized course focusing on product Design and Development in this realm. Design Thinking emerges as a prominent methodology in this context, originating from Stanford University and significantly impacting product design endeavors. Its integration into Biodesign processes underscores its potential to foster creativity and bolster overall design thinking capabilities. The text advocates for an exploration and assessment of teaching and learning practices to facilitate comprehensive education in Sustainable Design using biomaterials. This investigation extends to pedagogical techniques and methodologies employed in other universities worldwide, including Universidad EAFIT in Colombia, Università La Sapienza in Italy, and Morningside Academy for Design in the United States. Through directed interviews with professionals engaged in biomaterials education and product creation, the objective is to identify best practices and enhance the development processes in Guatemala. Ultimately, the overarching goal is to uncover methodologies used globally to broaden the applicability of product design and promote multidimensional design strategies that integrate sustainable principles, thus informing and improving practices in Guatemala and beyond.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":3,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
