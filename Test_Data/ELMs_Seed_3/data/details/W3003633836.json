However, low availability often becomes problematic when a bioactive natural product is promising to become a pharmaceutical or leading compound. Advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering provide a feasible solution for sustainable supply of these compounds. In this review, we have summarized current progress in engineering yeast cell factories for production of natural products, including terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenylpropanoids. We then discuss advanced strategies in metabolic engineering at three different dimensions, including point, line, and plane (corresponding to the individual enzymes and cofactors, metabolic pathways, and the global cellular network). In particular, we comprehensively discuss how to engineer cofactor biosynthesis for enhancing the biosynthesis efficiency, other than the enzyme activity. Finally, current challenges and perspective are also discussed for future engineering direction.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":146},"references":231,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
