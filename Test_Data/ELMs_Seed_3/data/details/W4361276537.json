One of the best biomaterials is bacterial cellulose (BC). There are several ways to produce BC, from using a pure strain to producing the fermented drink kombucha, which has a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeasts (SCOBY). Studies have shown that the use of agricultural waste can be a low-cost and sustainable way to create BC. This article conducts a literature review to analyze issues related to the creation of BC through kombucha production. The databases used were ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and SpringerLink. A total of 42 articles, dated from 2018 to 2022, were referenced to write this review. The findings contributed to the discussion of three topics: (1) The production of BC through food waste (including patents in addition to the scientific literature); (2) Areas of research, sectors, and products that use BC (including research that did not use the kombucha drink, but used food waste as a source of carbon and nitrogen); and (3) Production, sustainability, and circular economy: perspectives, challenges, and trends in the use of BC (including some advantages and disadvantages of BC production through the kombucha drink).","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":25},"references":42,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
