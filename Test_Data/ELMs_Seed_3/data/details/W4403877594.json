It explores the role of bioreactors in additive fabrication, highlighting their distinct characteristics compared with conventional digital manufacturing. The discussion is centered on the differences in materializing biologically-active (living) versus biologically-passive, or biologically-derived (nonliving) matter in which ingredients require closed-loop fabrication environments that differ from traditional additive manufacturing tools. Two novel biofabrication platforms, Microbial Design Studio and B | reactor are presented as examples with case studies demonstrating their use in various manufacturing workflows with live cells. The article emphasizes the unique capabilities of bioreactors in engaging with living matter and facilitating complex interactions between biological, algorithmic, and mechanical systems in additive manufacturing.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":20,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
