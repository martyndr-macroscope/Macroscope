Recently, it established a new initiative—the Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry—to showcase the tremendous importance of the chemical sciences by highlighting developments on the verge of becoming game-changing commercial breakthroughs [1]. Some have been truly transformational for our society, such as RNA vaccines and rapid tests, both key technologies to enable a smooth transition to the new normal after the COVID-19 pandemic. This year, the Top Ten efforts continue—featuring a brand-new logo and further actions to disseminate and promote the project beyond this publication. The new selection of emerging technologies gathers both well-established, high-technology readiness level (TRL) applications and ground-breaking opportunities for the chemical industry. Of course, many of them still address the ongoing coronavirus crisis, focusing on new pharmaceutical solutions to prevent the spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, many tackle the climate crisis and provide new roadmaps to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [2]. The consequences of global warming are here—heatwaves, floods, and wildfires devastate our planet constantly. Chemistry will provide pivotal tools towards a sustainable future [3], many included in this singular selection. IUPAC experts have selected the Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry 2021—ten ideas to catalyse industrial innovations and transform our world.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":47},"references":31,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
