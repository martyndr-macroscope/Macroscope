Recently, they have inspired functional designs from nano fibres to optimised buildings and architectures. We investigate the diversity of cactus skin properties in terms of toughness and resistance to cutting damage. Cacti are well known for their extreme adaptations to harsh environments, with soft, fleshy stems that expand and contract with water uptake and storage. This functioning is made possible by an extendable outer envelope (skin) and a fluted 3-dimensional structure of the stem. We explore the mechanical toughness and underlying structural organisation of the cactus skin in four species of cactus showing different growth forms. The toughness properties of the cactus skin is only one part of a multi-functional structure for surviving in extreme environments. The study suggests that survival involves a relatively “light” investment of tough materials in the outer envelope instead of a rigid “defensive” layer. This is capable of elastic deformation and enables water storage in challenging, arid environments. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the diversity of skin toughness and underlying structures in the biological world as providing potential new designs for technical envelopes.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":57,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
