In the Philippines, however, very few works have been conducted to isolate and identify indigenous, urease-producing (ureolytic) bacteria suitable for MICP. In this study, we isolated seven, ureolytic and potentially useful bacteria for MICP from marine sediments in Iligan City. DNA barcoding using 16s rDNA identified six of them as Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Bacillus paralicheniformis, Bacillus altitudinis, Bacillus aryabhattai, and Stutzerimonas stutzeri but the seventh was not identified since it was a bacterial consortium. Bio-cementation assay experiments showed negligible precipitation in the control (without bacteria) at pH 7, 8, and 9. However, precipitates were formed in all seven bacterial isolates, especially between pH 7 and 8 (0.7–4 g). Among the six identified bacterial species, more extensive precipitation (2.3–4 g) and higher final pH were observed in S. stutzeri, and B. aryabhattai, which indicate better urease production and decomposition, higher CO2 generation, and more favorable CaCO3 formation. Characterization of the precipitates by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) confirmed the formation of three carbonate minerals: calcite, aragonite, and vaterite. Based on these results, all six identified indigenous, ureolytic bacterial species from Iligan City are suitable for MICP provided that the pH is controlled between 7 and 8. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the urease-producing ability and potential for MICP of P. stutzeri, P. pseudoalcaligenes, S. stutzeri, and B. aryabhattai.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":7},"references":52,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
