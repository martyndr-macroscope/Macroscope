WSUD aims to align water systems with natural ecosystems by minimizing runoff, improving water quality, and promoting biodiversity while also offering recreational and aesthetic benefits for urban residents. While the environmental advantages of WSUD are well-established, its social and economic aspects warrant more in-depth exploration. This review analyses the social and economic impacts of WSUD, focusing on its effects on community well-being, property values, infrastructure costs, and public engagement. It also discusses the significance of citizen perceptions, socio-economic equity, and financing mechanisms in the adoption of WSUD. The findings highlight the necessity for interdisciplinary approaches and policy reforms that incorporate social and economic considerations into WSUD planning to ensure long-term success and sustainability. This analysis aims to enhance understanding of how WSUD can contribute to resilient, equitable, and sustainable urban communities.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":59,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
