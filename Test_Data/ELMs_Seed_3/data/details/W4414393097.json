As a creative partner, AI enhances biodigital design by enabling generative algorithms, advanced simulations, and sensor-driven systems that cocreate with natural processes – optimizing material performance, reducing waste, and accelerating innovation across fields such as architecture, fashion, food and biomedicine. As a reflective tool, AI supports interdisciplinary coherence and ethical accountability by analyzing semantic patterns, mapping knowledge networks, and modelling long-term ecological and societal impacts. These capabilities allow AI to illuminate the flow of ideas across disciplines and support ongoing alignment with ethical and ecological values. Yet, AI also presents risks, including the erosion of human agency, amplification of systemic biases, and increasing fragmentation across sectors. To address this, this paper proposes the GRACE framework – Goal, Function, Resonance, Agency, Collaboration and Embodiment – as a guide for responsible and sustainable integration of AI in biodigital fabrication. The framework emphasizes aligning AI applications with regenerative, equitable and ecological principles. The paper aims to promote ethical and interdisciplinary AI-driven innovation that reimagines our relationship with materials and living systems. Future research should focus on operationalizing this framework and developing AI tools that uphold these values throughout the entire lifecycle of design and fabrication.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":24,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
