It firstly depicts the core knowledge at the base of new Emerging Materials and Technologies (EM&amp;Ts), namely: Interactive Connected Smart Materials, wearable based (ICS), Nanomaterials, Advanced Growing Materials, and Experimental Wood-Based Materials. It then provides the theoretical findings of a literature review carried out to perimeter the peculiarities of the four areas, the used approaches, and methodologies; the results of a collaborative workshop aimed at re-elaborating the findings of the literature review and setting the ground for the contents of the original framework for designing and teaching EM&amp;Ts. It finally displays the result of both the literature review and the collaborative workshop in the form of the unique method divided into three phases (understanding, shaping, and applying). It will also include a section dedicated to the tools elaborated to support the method, such as a material toolkit and integration cards. A discussion closes the text by showing the pro and cons of the new method and its further development.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":24,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
