One species of the group, Pseudomonas putida, thrives as a colonizer of plant roots and frequently inhabits soils polluted with various types of chemical waste. Owing to a combination of historical contingencies and inherent qualities, a particular strain, P. putida KT2440, emerged time ago as an archetype of an environmental microorganism amenable to recombinant DNA technologies, which was also capable of catabolizing chemical pollutants. Later, the same bacterium progressed as a reliable platform for programming traits and activities in various biotechnological applications. This article summarizes the stepwise upgrading of P. putida KT2440 from being a system for fundamental studies on the biodegradation of aromatic compounds (especially when harboring the TOL plasmid pWW0) to its adoption as a chassis of choice in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Although there are remaining uncertainties about the taxonomic classification of KT2440, advanced genome editing capabilities allow us to tailor its genetic makeup to meet specific needs. This makes its traditional categorization somewhat less important, while also increasing the strain’s overall value for contemporary industrial and environmental uses.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":9,"cited_by_count":31},"references":96,"networkCitations":9,"seed":false}
