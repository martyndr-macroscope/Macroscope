Thus, this chapter explores strategies for a human-centered and regenerative built environment that addresses the challenges of urbanization, climate change, and societal needs through biomaterials. This approach focuses on creating housing and infrastructure that enhances people’s quality of life while reducing environmental footprints, prioritizing sustainability, resilience, and adaptability to changing climate conditions. Key considerations include indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and built environment restoration. Regenerative design principles focus on systems that restore and regenerate natural ecosystems. Emerging innovations, biomaterials, and circular economy concepts are fundamental in implementing these principles. By using renewable resources and reducing waste, buildings and infrastructures can contribute positively to the environment rather than depleting it. Finally, case studies will illustrate how these strategies impact health, sustainability, and resilience.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":1},"references":58,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
