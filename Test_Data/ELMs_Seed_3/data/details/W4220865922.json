However, empirical research indicates that such attempts to integrate multiple ways of knowing often fall short and significant knowledge conflicts remain. Scholars suggest this may be due to inadequate attention to power in the regulatory arena. The purpose of this study is to examine how power and knowledge influence the process and outcome of EIA in a participatory context. We develop a case study analysis of the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project, located in Labrador, Canada. We use situational analysis to analyze documents produced over the course of the EIA and semi‐structured interviews. We find evidence of pluralism in knowledge production in the EIA process, but a distinct knowledge hierarchy in EIA outcome. We argue that this knowledge hierarchy is achieved through depoliticization of the EIA process. In particular, we identify the concept of “project inertia” as a distinct mechanism of depoliticization present in EIA and make policy prescriptions to improve the Canadian EIA process. This research contributes to broader theoretical discussions about pluralism in decision‐making processes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":5},"references":123,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
