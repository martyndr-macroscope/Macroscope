The resulting strain P. putida Iso2 produced isobutanol with a substrate specific product yield ( Y Iso/S ) of 22 ± 2 mg per gram of glucose under aerobic conditions. Furthermore, we identified the ketoacid decarboxylase from Carnobacterium maltaromaticum to be a suitable alternative for isobutanol production, since replacement of kivD from L. lactis in P. putida Iso2 by the variant from C. maltaromaticum yielded an identical Y Iso/S . Although P. putida is regarded as obligate aerobic, we show that under oxygen deprivation conditions this bacterium does not grow, remains metabolically active, and that engineered producer strains secreted isobutanol also under the non‐growing conditions.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":25},"references":56,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
