Its intrinsic properties have been stimulating the global biopolymer market, with strong growth expectations in the coming years. Several bacterial species are capable of producing bacterial cellulose under different culture conditions; in this context, strategies aimed at metabolic engineering and several possibilities of carbon sources have provided opportunities for the bacterial cellulose's biotechnological exploration. In this article, an overview of biosynthesis pathways in different carbon sources for the main producing microorganisms, metabolic flux under different growth conditions, and their influence on the structural and functional characteristics of bacterial cellulose is provided. In addition, the main industrial applications and ways to reduce costs and optimize its production using alternative sources are discussed, contributing to new insights on the exploitation of this biomaterial in the context of the bioeconomy.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":13},"references":150,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
