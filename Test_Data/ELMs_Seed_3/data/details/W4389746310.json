{"id":"W4389746310","title":"Philosophy of technology in the digital age : The datafication of the World, the homo virtualis, and the capacity of technological innovations to set the World free","authors":["Vincent Blok"],"venue":"","year":2023,"doi":"10.18174/639666","url":"https://doi.org/10.18174/639666","openalex":"https://openalex.org/W4389746310","abstract":"Disruptive technologies disrupt the World in which we live and act. My hypothesis is that technological innovations themselves constitute the World in a non-anthropocentric and non-determinist manner. This broader understanding of the impact of digital technologies raises critical questions regarding the converge of the physical and the virtual in the digital age. I end with a progressive perspective on the emancipatory potential of disruptive innovations to set the world free, as is needed in times of climate change.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":13},"references":33,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
