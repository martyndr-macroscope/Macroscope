Hansen's thesis developed in Feed-Forward regarding twenty-first-century media. It is suggested that it is an adequate response for a cosmotechnology for the post-Anthropocene. I develop a possible example to illustrate what this may be. This theory is embellished by excursions into Deleuze and Guattari's position regarding the Outside; I develop my own thoughts on technology referred to Lassen and Macht technologies that are in tension with one another. Limitations of data are raised including Gregory Chaitin's Omega principle. What may be possible subversions are discussed. Lastly, Parisi's critical computation and 'blind optics' of machinic vision are introduced.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":36,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
