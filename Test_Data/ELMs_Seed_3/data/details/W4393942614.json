Mycelium Textiles represent a novel typology of mycelium-based composites (MBC). The Myx Sail absorbers are grown on a composition of different layers of plant fibres combining woven jute textile with hemp mat and loose wood wool substrate enhancing the mechanical and acoustic properties of the composite. Two complementary acoustic tests were conducted to measure the absorbing properties of the mycelium material and its effects on the acoustics of the exhibition hall. The results show that the sail acts effectively as an acoustic absorber especially in higher range of frequencies, reducing the reverberation time and improving speech intelligibility. The effect of the sail on the overall room acoustics is especially effective, if the sound source is placed directly underneath the sail. The results of a complementary survey amongst visitors on their subjective perception of comfort and well-being however indicate that the degree to which a grown surface (and by extension, a grown building) is perceived positively or negatively depends on the relationship the individual has with Nature.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":2},"references":7,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
