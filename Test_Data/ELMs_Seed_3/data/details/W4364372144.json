The article is devoted to the analysis of changes in the problematic area of the philosophy of technology. This analysis is necessary if we are to comprehend the current state of the philosophy of technology and envision its future development. Methods. The philo­sophical and methodological analysis employed here allowed for the discovery of the trend in the development of conventional approaches to technology understanding based on the expansion and evolution of the organoprojection principle, which explains the development and operation of artificial neural networks. The conclusion about the role and ubiquitous penetration of technology in modern society was based on the system-structural method; it objectively prompted philosophers to revise the fundamental ideas in the field of technology and technosphere. Artificial intellectual objects with a certain level of autonomy — i. e., those that take on the characteristics of a subject — are included in the definition of \"technology\". Results and Discussion. One of the most important contemporary trends in the growth of the philosophy of technology is the inclusion of issues related to the in­tegration of technical and scientific knowledge and the emergence of a single complex in philosophical discourse, as well as the analysis of technoscience and its manifestations in areas like biotechnology and digital technologies. Issues pertaining to social technologies in the me­ dium term, such as the socio-humanitarian expertise of technical pro­jects, are touched upon, among others. The issue of a scientist, engi­neer, or technician's social responsibility is one of the traditional but newly interpreted problems. The foundation of the philosophical anal­ysis of growing responsibility is the discovery of the connection be­tween freedom and the coming demand for technological activity. An apparent trend is a greater emphasis on humans, on protecting them as a species, and on altering their status in the technical world, for in­stance, within the human-computer system. It's still up for debate whether it is possible to create a hybrid human form integrated with electronic components. Conclusion. The range of issues in contempo­rary philosophy of technology has significantly expanded, according to the trends examined.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":17,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
