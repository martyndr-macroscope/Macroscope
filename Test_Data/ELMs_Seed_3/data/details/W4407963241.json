The study aims to inspire discussions on more-than-human agency and nature as a co-teacher, incorporating post-humanist perspectives, viewed through a lens of local, social, and cultural contexts. Drawing on the concept of Wild Pedagogies and grounded in interactions between educators, students, and more-than-humans, this study highlights how mindful interconnectedness and respect for more-than-human agency can foster profound learning opportunities. Field observations suggest that educators in Yamanoko, who embrace amateurism and respect the agencies of both learners and more-than-humans, effectively facilitate meaningful engagement with more-than-human agency as a co-teacher for students. The critical re-examination of concepts that have long been considered 'benign', such as conventional constructivism and professionalism, can facilitate a transformative shift in educational culture towards a more respectful worldview. This consideration leads to re-discover the culturally ingrained sense of vernacular 'nature as a co-teacher', which is often practiced unconsciously, and highlights its distinction from the prevailing stewardship pedagogy. Through cross-cultural exchange, we can explore and deepen these practices in pluralistic vernacular ways.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":54,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
