In this prospective review, we take a snapshot of current activity in this rapidly developing area, focussing on prominent examples for high-performance applications such as those required for protective materials and the aerospace sector. The continued growth of this emerging field will be facilitated by the convergence of expertise from a range of diverse disciplines, including molecular biology, polymer chemistry, materials science and process engineering. This review highlights the most significant recent advances and address the cross-disciplinary challenges currently being faced.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":27},"references":181,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
