This scientific paper explores innovative strategies for the utilization of construction and demolition waste (CDW) to promote a sustainable future in the built environment. A comprehensive literature review is conducted to analyze existing research and highlight the potential of CDW recycling and repurposing. Case studies of green building projects that incorporate CDW are presented to demonstrate successful implementations and their environmental benefits. Life cycle assessments are utilized to evaluate the overall environmental impact and resource efficiency of these projects. The economic viability of CDW utilization is analyzed through cost-benefit assessments and return on investment calculations. The paper also emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement and policy support to foster the adoption of sustainable practices in the construction industry. The findings indicate that innovative utilization of CDW contributes to waste reduction, energy conservation, and resource preservation, making a substantial contribution to sustainable development and a greener future.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":16,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
