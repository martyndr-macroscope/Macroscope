The instrument was adapted from the Attitude towards Science Measure (ATSM) based on some theoretical and research review. The instrument focused on six sub-constructs of attitude towards science: Learning science in school, practical work in science, science outside of school, the importance of science, self-concept in science, and future participation in science. A total of 452 primary school students in Sabah had responded to the 37-item questionnaire. The internal consistency reliability (composite reliability and Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient), convergent validity (Average Variance Extracted), and discriminant validity (cross-loadings, Fornell-Larcker criterion, and Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio) for each item of the instrument were being assessed. The results of PLS-SEM analysis show that all scales were unidimensional. Internal reliability using Cronbach’s alpha varies between .651 to .723, and the composite reliability varies between .801 to .844, indicating a satisfactory level of internal consistency. The instrument assessment has shown that ATS is a valid and reliable instrument to measure 10-12 years old primary school students’ interests, attitudes, values, and priorities in issues related to science.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":26,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
