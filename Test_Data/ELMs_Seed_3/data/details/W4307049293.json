Currently, in scientific policy, discussions about ELSI have been conducted using the framework of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). This study examines a current and significant case study in Japan, Molecular Robotics (Molbot), to discuss and practice RRI in emerging science. In the case of Molbot, the research community spontaneously set out to create a framework of ethical principles in collaboration with social scientists. This was done by looking at previous similar cases and conducting workshops for the consideration of ELSI in future scenarios. This process of creating and accepting the ethical principles of Molecular Robotics by the community is significant for this field as it shows the appearance of scientific autonomy by Molbot researchers. Furthermore, this process can be regarded as the co-production of knowledge on ELSI and RRI at the early stage of research and development in an interdisciplinary research field and serve as the start of a blueprint for other emerging S&amp;T seeking a favorable relationship with society.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":7},"references":28,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
