Luck, I argue, is part and parcel with the actions required to protect our epigenomes, and points to the need of dismissing the ensuing individual responsibility claims. But what about the consensual alternative of appeals to collective responsibilities? If a consideration of luck reveals the vulnerabilities, circumstances and uncertainties that call into question individual responsibilities, the same kind of reasoning could apply analogously to collective agencies. Luck is no less of a challenge to our moral intuitions in the case of collective epigenetic responsibilities, and demands abandoning dominant atomistic framings parsing out individuals and collectives in the societal uptake of epigenetics.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":15},"references":101,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
