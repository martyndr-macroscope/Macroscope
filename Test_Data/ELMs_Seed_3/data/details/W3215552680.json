Pathogenic fungi, which also pose a constant threat to public health, remain understudied. Relevant data remains comparatively scarce and scattered among many different sources, hindering the development of sequencing-based detection workflows for novel fungal pathogens. No prediction method working for agents across all three groups is available, even though the cause of an infection is often difficult to identify from symptoms alone. Results We present a curated collection of fungal host range data, comprising records on human, animal and plant pathogens, as well as other plant-associated fungi, linked to publicly available genomes. We show that it can be used to predict the pathogenic potential of novel fungal species directly from DNA sequences with either sequence homology or deep learning. We develop learned, numerical representations of the collected genomes and visualize the landscape of fungal pathogenicity. Finally, we train multi-class models predicting if next-generation sequencing reads originate from novel fungal, bacterial or viral threats. Conclusions The neural networks trained using our data collection enable accurate detection of novel fungal pathogens. A curated set of over 1,400 genomes with host and pathogenicity metadata supports training of machine learning models and sequence comparison, not limited to the pathogen detection task.
