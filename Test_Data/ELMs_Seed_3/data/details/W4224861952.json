In order to improve the accuracy of subsequent image alignment and defect detection, this paper compares the effects of the pixel-level edge detection algorithm and the subpixel-level edge detection algorithm and finally selects the subpixel-based edge detection algorithm to extract the edge of the image. In addition, this paper compares the traditional defect detection algorithm through research and experiment and proposes an improved image phase difference method according to the actual situation. The experimental research shows that the traditional arts and crafts intelligent analysis system based on digital technology proposed in this paper has a very good effect. At the same time, with the support of this system, the intelligent analysis of traditional arts and crafts in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area can be carried out efficiently.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":21,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
