This is essential in the context of varying climatic conditions that affect the availability of resources for agriculture. The integration of tools such as IoT and sensor networks can allow farmers to obtain real-time data on their crops, assessing key health factors, such as soil conditions, plant water status, presence of pests, and environmental factors, among others, which can finally result in data-based decision-making to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. Also, this can be enhanced by incorporating tools such as drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can increase monitoring capabilities through comprehensive field surveys and high-precision crop growth tracking. On the other hand, big data analytics and AI are crucial in analyzing extensive datasets to uncover patterns and trends and provide valuable insights for improving agricultural practices. This paper highlights the key technological advancements and applications in smart crop management, addressing challenges and barriers to the global adoption of these current and new types of technologies and emphasizing the need for ongoing research and collaboration to achieve sustainable and efficient crop production.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":88},"references":163,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
