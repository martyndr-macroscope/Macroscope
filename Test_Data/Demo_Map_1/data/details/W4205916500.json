Moreover, this paper combines the existing hardware equipment to construct the painting works' recreation system and obtains the image processing module. After the system is constructed, the effect of copying and recreating painting works is analyzed through the mobile digital multimedia big data analysis technology. Finally, this paper constructs the system of this paper through simulation methods and uses experiments to calculate the feature recognition effect and copy effect of the painting works of the system. Through experimental analysis, it can be known that the copying and recreation system of painting works based on mobile digital multimedia big data analysis proposed in this paper can help painters effectively improve the effect of recreation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":21,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
