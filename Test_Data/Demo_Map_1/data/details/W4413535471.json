Moreover, this paper analyzes the electromagnetic field numerical calculation theory required for the simulation calculation of the design of photonic resonance coupling structure and dynamic modulation structure in combination with the actual requirements of the virtual direction of artistic design, including finite difference frequency domain method, rigorous coupled wave analysis, and time-domain coupled mode theory. In addition, this paper combines the simulation analysis to add the modulated finite difference frequency domain method and the extended model of the strict coupled wave analysis. According to the teaching experimental research, the intelligent networked classroom model for design art major in private colleges and universities proposed in this paper has good effects, and can effectively promote the teaching effect of design art in private colleges and universities.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":0},"references":17,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
