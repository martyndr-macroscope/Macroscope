Green roofs have several advantages at different levels, of which this paper highlights the ability to retain rainwater, to reduce problems with flooding in peaks of rainfall, and to increase in urban green infrastructure with all the benefits associated. In this sense, green roofs’ impact on the design of a public stormwater drainage system and their implications for urban stormwater management was analyzed when compared with conventional roofs. If green roofs are used on the buildings in the study urban area, which has about 2.1 ha and is located in rainfall region B of Portugal, then the weighted average runoff coefficient (Cm) for the study area is 0.59. This scenario leads to a reduction in the maximum flow rate of 15.89% compared to the use of conventional roofs, with a Cm of 0.70 for the same area. Thus, the use of green roofs instead of conventional roofs can have positive impacts on the surface runoff in urban areas and contribute to more sustainable urban drainage.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":3},"references":30,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
