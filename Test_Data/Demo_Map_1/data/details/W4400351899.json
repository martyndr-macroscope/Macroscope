The purpose of this research is to identify the determinants of the purchase intention of sustainable fashion, and the relationship between price and the purchase of sustainable fashion. A questionnaire was administered, which made it possible to define the concept of sustainable fashion, to use PLS-SEM to identify the determinants, and to apply linear regression models and t-tests of two independent samples (two-tailed test). The concept of sustainable fashion comprises the dimensions of manufacturing with a reduced environmental impact, consuming second-hand fashion products, manufacturing in an environmentally friendly way, reusing fashion products, manufacturing to last longer, manufacturing according to fair trade principles, using recycled materials, and manufacturing from organic materials. The PLS-SEM results show that purchase intention is determined by consumer knowledge, environmental beliefs, and willingness to pay more. The research also revealed that there is a non-linear (quadratic or exponential) relationship between the price of the product and the price increase that consumers are willing to pay and that they value the dimensions of sustainable fashion differently. The purchase intention determinants of consumers and non-consumers of sustainable fashion are identical, yet the dimensions of sustainable fashion are valued differently by each group.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":10},"references":97,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
