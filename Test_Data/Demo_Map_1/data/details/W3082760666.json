However, P. putida on its own cannot make much use of such complex substrates, mainly because it lacks an efficient extracellular depolymerizing apparatus. We seek to address this limitation by adopting a recombinant cellulosome strategy for this host. In this work, we report an essential step in this endeavor—a display of designer enzyme-anchoring protein \"scaffoldins\", encompassing cohesin binding domains from divergent cellulolytic bacterial species on the P. putida surface. Two P. putida chassis strains, EM42 and EM371, with streamlined genomes and differences in the composition of the outer membrane were employed in this study. Scaffoldin variants were optimally delivered to their surface with one of four tested autotransporter systems (Ag43 from Escherichia coli), and the efficient display was confirmed by extracellular attachment of chimeric β-glucosidase and fluorescent proteins. Our results not only highlight the value of cell surface engineering for presentation of recombinant proteins on the envelope of Gram-negative bacteria but also pave the way toward designer cellulosome strategies tailored for P. putida.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":10,"cited_by_count":24},"references":90,"networkCitations":10,"seed":false}
