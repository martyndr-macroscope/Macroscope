This paper constructs 35 grassroots social governance innovation samples. Using the TOE theoretical framework and a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this paper analyzes the joint effects and interactive relationships of multiple factors on grassroots social governance innovation performance from three dimensions: technology, organization, and environment. The research reveals that internal environmental openness is a necessary condition for achieving high innovation performance in grassroots social governance, and proposes four grouping models that affect the performance of grassroots social governance innovation. This paper explores the inner logic of grassroots social governance innovation from a histological perspective, and on this basis proposes an adaptive path to enhance the performance of grassroots social governance innovation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":4},"references":40,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
