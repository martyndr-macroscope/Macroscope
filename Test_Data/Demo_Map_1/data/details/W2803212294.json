We discuss the shift in position of the authorities, academia, media, non-governmental organizations, regulatory agencies, patients, and doctors which could enable further advances in the research and application of the therapy. In addition, we discuss methods to obtain optimal phage preparations and suggest the potential of novel applications of phage therapy extending beyond its anti-bacterial action.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":126},"references":255,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
