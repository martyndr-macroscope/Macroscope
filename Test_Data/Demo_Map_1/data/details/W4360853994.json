Studies have shown this is due to insufficient cognition of the structural relationship between data and events. Shili Theory is an attractive concept. To embed intelligent agricultural technology in events and the natural environment, especially to unify and standardize agricultural production data, firstly, this paper has defined the concept of Shili Theory which researches the natural regularity of the event by Shili Mirrored Structure. Secondly, this paper has proposed a Shili Mirrored Structure based on the technology development path (from the human brain memory mechanism to the information storage mechanism to intelligent technology). Finally, the structure has been applied to develop an intelligent system of agricultural production data management. In rice production of Jilin Province, it forms the event chain of the whole plant 5T (seed, seeding, paddy shoot, grain, product period operation) and grain period 5T (harvesting, field stacking, drying, warehousing, storing). The system application shows that this management structure can reduce data flow, improve data utilization, and enhance the correlation between data and events. It can realize the quality improvement of the agricultural production process, especially revealing the 8.83% significant latent loss in rice harvest.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":4},"references":57,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
