They convert chemical energy from fuels into electricity through chemical reactions with an oxidizing agent. Fuel cells are highly efficient and can produce electricity with very little pollution. They are used in a variety of applications, including powering buildings and vehicles, and as a backup power source. However, the infrastructure for fuel cells is still not fully developed and the cost of fuel cells is currently high, hindering their widespread adoption. This article discusses various advanced fuel cell types with descriptions of their working principles and applications. It provides some insights on the requirements of solar-derived chemical fuel cells as well as some novel materials for the fabrication of solar-derived chemical fuel cells. Discussions on the limitations of solar-derived fuel cells were provided in relation to environmental hazards involved in the use of these cells.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":10},"references":66,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
