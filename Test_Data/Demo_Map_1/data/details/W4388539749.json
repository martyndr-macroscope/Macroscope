Pseudomonas possess characteristics of tolerance and stress resistance making them valuable hosts for industrial and environmental biotechnology. However, efficient and high-throughput genetic engineering tools have limited metabolic engineering efforts and applications. To improve their genome editing capabilities, we first employed a computational biology workflow to generate a genus-specific library of potential single-stranded DNA-annealing proteins (SSAPs). Assessment of the library was performed in different Pseudomonas using a high-throughput pooled recombinase screen followed by Oxford Nanopore NGS analysis. Among different active variants with variable levels of allelic replacement frequency (ARF), efficient SSAPs were found and characterized for mediating recombineering in the four tested species. New variants yielded higher ARFs than existing ones in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and expanded the field of recombineering in Pseudomonas taiwanensisand Pseudomonas fluorescens. These findings will enhance the mutagenesis capabilities of these members of the Pseudomonas genus, increasing the possibilities for biotransformation and enhancing their potential for synthetic biology applications. .","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":7},"references":77,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
