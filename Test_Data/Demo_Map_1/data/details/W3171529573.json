An analysis of recent literature about the economic impact of linear to circular (L2C) transition is made. The review investigates the economic implications (i.e. cost-benefit) of deployment of enabling technologies, tools and methodologies within the circular water systems. The study is enhanced by presenting the results of our investigation into the policy impact (push-barriers) of L2C transition. As the vehicle for the L2C transition, nature-based solutions (NBS) and its economic and policy implications is discussed. A framework is proposed for the monetary assessment of the costs of investment in NBS technologies, infrastructure and education against the environmental and socio-economic benefits within the policy frameworks. This framework may build the early foundation for bridging the gap that exists for a systematic and objective economic impact (cost-benefit) analysis of L2C transition in the Water sector. This framework will lead to a generic multi-parametric cost model of NBS for Circularity Water Systems.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":32},"references":78,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
