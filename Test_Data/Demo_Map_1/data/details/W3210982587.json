The common focus is on achieving development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the future of the Planet and its People. In the field of fashion and textiles, this momentum toward sustainability translates also into an embryonic process of transformation of the material dimension. This positive transformation is characterized by the choice of new textile solutions supported by growing investments, radical experimentation, and a strong commitment to sustainability. Within this framework, there is a growing interest in bio-based materials, not only from material engineering experts, but also from designers who are starting to explore the possibilities offered by these materials through experiments more focused on design and aesthetics. According to the presented scenario, the proposed article investigates how to strategically implement the systematization of experiments in order to promote the development of an efficient and effective production chain for the growth of bacterial cellulose (BC). To do so, the authors will draw on the knowledge reservoir produced by the De- FORMA project - of which they are all members. This project has just initiated experimentation around the systematization of growth processes and characterization of bacterial cellulose. Specifically, the materials and methods used during the project's initial research phases will be here introduced and illustrated.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":16,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
