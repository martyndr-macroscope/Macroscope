The focus of the research will be on material design and its ability to contribute to the innovation of territories. In line with the principles of hyperlocal design, it will investigate approaches and virtuous experiences that will contribute to the re-activation of specific territorial contexts starting from endogenous resources and knowledge. Through the detailed exploration of the current scenario and the analysis of best practices, the contribution will argue its hypothesis in favour of project experiences rooted within a specific territorial context, reducing the material circuits. Aiming to provide a reflection on a specific project scenario, the paper will present a selection of projects realised at the Control + Junk Lab Study Centre at the Iuav University of, as peculiar case histories about the Venice Lagoon area. This contribution aims to provide new research perspectives in this area, oriented to the reactivation of traditional knowledge systems, recognised as depositories of indigenous knowledge of territories and local biocultural practices.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":5,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
