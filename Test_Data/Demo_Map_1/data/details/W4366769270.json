The high specific surface area and the abundance of hydrogen‐bond adsorption active sites in pore structure of HOFs@Fe 3+ facilitate strong interactions with the double OH in bisphenol A (BPA), resulting in the highest saturation adsorption of BPA that has been reported so far (452 mg g ‐1 ). In addition, the ordered conjugate stacking framework structure and hydrogen bond of HOFs@Fe 3+ and the variable valence properties of Fe 3+ create new pathways for efficient separation of photogenerated carriers. The results show that HOFs@Fe 3+ can completely adsorb and photodegrade 50 ppm BPA within 20 min, owing to the abundant hydrogen bond that acts both as adsorption sites to accelerate the mass transfer process and as catalytic sites to ensure adsorption and photodegradation can be matched synergistically. Meanwhile, the efficiency of photocatalytic H 2 production by HOFs@Fe 3+ reaches 21.55 mmol g ‐1 h ‐1 with non‐noble metal Fe 3+ as co‐catalyst. This tri‐functional material with high adsorption capacity, high photodegradation efficiency, and high photocatalytic H 2 production activity can be successfully used to solve the long‐standing conflict between environment and energy.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":70},"references":52,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
