The textile chain is wide and diversified according to the final product. The basic raw material is the fibers/filaments, however, other compounds/materials are necessary for the formation of the part. In this context are the trimmings, elements that are part of the finishing of the pieces and that can be used for decoration or functionality. The materials most used in the production of trim are synthetic. Therefore, this article aims to present a review about sustainable trims, obtained from different materials, which are usually discarded in nature, and which are increasingly being used in the textile and fashion industry, as well as clothing companies that have already adopted sustainable practices and the challenges that arise when adopting sustainable materials.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":46,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
