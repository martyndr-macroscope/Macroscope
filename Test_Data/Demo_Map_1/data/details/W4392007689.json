The research is based on an exhaustive literature evaluation in the fields of ergonomical and sustainable materials in fashion. The framework consists of three components: designing for ergonomics, selecting sustainable materials, and assessing the environmental impact of the production process. To validate the framework, a survey was conducted among fashion and textile industry professionals. The results imply a high level of awareness and interest in the incorporation of ergonomics and material sustainability, but also reveal some obstacles in the industry's implementation of these practises. The study concludes that a comprehensive approach to ergonomic design and material sustainability can result in improved working conditions for employees, reduced environmental impact, and improved product quality in the apparel manufacturing industry.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":16,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
