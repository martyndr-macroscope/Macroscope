Bacterial cellulose has been produced directly from fermentation into sheets but not yet investigated in terms of producing filaments directly from fermentation. This leaves a wealth of material qualities unexplored. Further, by growing the material directly into filaments, production such as wet spinning are made redundant, thus reducing textile manufacturing steps. The aim of this study was to grow the bio-material, namely bacterial cellulose directly into a filament. This was achieved using a method of co-designing with the characteristics of biological materials. The method combines approaches of material-driven textile design and human-centred co-design to investigate co-designing with the characteristics of living materials for biological material production. The project is part of a wider exploration of bio-manufacturing textiles from waste. The practice-based approach brought together biological sciences and material design through a series of iterative experiments. This, in turn, resulted in designing with the inherent characteristics of bacterial cellulose, and by doing so filaments were designed to be fabricated directly from fermentation. In this investigation, creative exploration was encouraged within a biological laboratory space, showing how interdisciplinary collaboration can offer innovative alternative bioproduction routes for textile filament production.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":11,"cited_by_count":14},"references":29,"networkCitations":11,"seed":false}
