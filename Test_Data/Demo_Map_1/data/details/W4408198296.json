However, New Zealandâ€™s construction codes and sustainability standards lack cohesive, region-specific guidance, posing challenges for industry professionals in selecting appropriate materials. This study aims to identify the key factors influencing SCM selection within the New Zealand construction sector. An online questionnaire was distributed to 115 industry professionals, and data were analyzed using a structural equation modeling (SEM) with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the relationships among social, economic, environmental, and technical factors. The finding was that technical factors are vital in achieving sustainable construction. Additionally, the social, economic, environmental, and technical factors were strongly correlated, affecting the selection of SCMs. Based on this research, construction consultants should advise customers on materials and the long-term economic benefits of investing in sustainable materials, which will cut operating expenses and environmental effects.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":58,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
