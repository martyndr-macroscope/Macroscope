Visions of sociotechnical change often ascribe responsibility for achieving the desired change to specific actors. However, there is little research on how visions create, change, and preserve responsibilities in the present. Drawing on Vision Assessment, we present a case-study on visions of neuromorphic computing in NeuroSys, a research and innovation cluster located in the Aachen region in Germany, which develops brain-inspired computing technology, also known as neuromorphic computing. Based on interviews, participant observation, and document analysis, we identify a core vision, which imagines the region as a prominent center of neuromorphic computing, and three satellite visions, focusing on, respectively, entrepreneurship, science, and society. We analyze all visions through the lens of “responsibility boundary-work” operating in the dimensions of time, space, and actor constellation. This concept captures the selective conferral and deferral of responsibilities through visions, highlighting how normative boundaries are drawn in local practices. We further shed light on the larger institutional conditions shaping responsibility boundary-work by attending to the “politics of visions.” Power struggles are enacted through the ways in which visions confer and defer responsibilities. Tensions between these practices reflect conflicts over desirable social orders and power distributions within them, revealing the socio-political nature of visions. We discuss the implications of these findings for governance approaches that pursue responsible research and technology development, and we conclude that responsibility boundary-work may limit the potential of governance to conceive of and work toward responsible futures.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":0},"references":86,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
