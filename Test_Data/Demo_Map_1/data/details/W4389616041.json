Previously, extracytoplasmic function sigma factors (ECFs), a diverse group of alternative sigma factors with distinct promoter specificities, were shown to have great potential as context-independent regulators, but so far, they have only been used in a few model species. Here, we show that the alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti , which has been proposed as a plant-associated bacterial chassis for synthetic biology, has a similar phylogenetic ECF acceptance range as the gammaproteobacterium Escherichia coli . A common set of orthogonal ECF-based regulators that can be used in both bacterial hosts was identified and used to create 2-step delay circuits. The genetic circuits were implemented in single copy in E. coli by chromosomal integration using an established method that utilizes bacteriophage integrases. In S. meliloti , we demonstrated the usability of single-copy pABC plasmids as equivalent carriers of the synthetic circuits. The circuits were either implemented on a single pABC or modularly distributed on 3 such plasmids. In addition, we provide a toolbox containing pABC plasmids compatible with the Golden Gate (MoClo) cloning standard and a library of basic parts that enable the construction of ECF-based circuits in S. meliloti and in E. coli . This work contributes to building a context-independent and species-overarching ECF-based toolbox for synthetic biology applications.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":2},"references":76,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
