While design is a human-centered field and practice, many intruders or competing theories challenge human-centered ap-proaches and propose ways to include nonhumans in design. This article explores different perspectives for post-anthropocentric design approaches and focuses on how design can approach the notion more-than-human as an intruder to human-centered design. Proposing practice-based studies of making-with the environment as an alternative to human-centered design, it explores how to design beyond ideas of \"human progress\". Firstly, more-than-human and related concepts are introduced. Secondly, how human-centered design can be challenged is explained through the concept of core theories and intruders, relating it with \"more-than-human\" and posthuman theories. Afterwards, traditional knowledge is introduced as a concept to explore more-than-human approaches, and a case study is introduced as a post-anthropocentric making activity. The case study demonstrates that designers should acknowledge and listen to traditional and indigenous knowledges, while shifting to a more-than-human design approach.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":10},"references":34,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
