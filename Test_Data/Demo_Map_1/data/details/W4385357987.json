Based on the fundamental biological studies on spider silk, significant research efforts have been devoted to biotechnology and chemical synthesis to mimic or even exceed the properties of natural spider silk fibers. Moreover, the natural spider silk fiber has been simulated with the burgeoning development of numerous spinning technologies, including wet spinning, dry spinning, electrostatic spinning, and microfluidic spinning, which continuously help to optimize the properties of synthetic spider silk. The unique characteristics of natural spider silk include high refraction transmission, heat resistance, antimicrobial properties, biocompatibility, and super shrinking. Biconical recreation of spider silk with special features and extraordinary capabilities demonstrates potential applications in biomedicine, smart wearables, artificial muscles and sensors, aerospace and other domains.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":6},"references":143,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
