Through an extensive review of literature, existing research, and case studies, we critically examine the application of biomimicry principles in enhancing circular economy practices. Our methodology synthesises insights from across disciplines, employing a thematic and gap analyses to uncover prevalent trends and identify research deficits. Building on Janine Benyus' seminal biomimicry work, we introduce a novel framework derived from Life's Principles to evaluate the sustainability of circular economy efforts, focusing on their consistency with or deviation from biomimetic principles. Our research finds a significant correlation between the circular economy's emphasis on reducing waste and improving resource efficiency and biomimicry's focus on nature‐inspired sustainable design. We pinpoint “resource efficiency” and “eco‐friendly chemistry” as primary areas where circular economy measures reflect biomimetic ideals. However, our analysis also reveals a considerable gap in incorporating local socio‐economic factors into circular economy frameworks. This oversight highlights the necessity for in‐depth research into how circular economy initiatives can be tailored to enhance socio‐economic resilience and community well‐being. By underscoring these parallels and identifying key research opportunities, our article elucidates how biomimicry could drive more effective circular economy practices. We argue that future research should focus on bridging the identified gap by exploring how circular economy models can incorporate local socio‐economic considerations, thereby ensuring more impactful sustainability outcomes.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":14},"references":82,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
