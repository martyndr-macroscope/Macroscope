Two case studies are presented, one harnessing plant electrophysiological signals and the other leveraging state-change properties of natural protein and cellulose materials.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":63,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
