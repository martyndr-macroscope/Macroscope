Cultivated on sweetened black tea, the mutually proliferating bacteria (Acetobacter xylinum, A. xylinoides, and Bacterium gluconicum) and yeast strains (Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomycodes ludwigii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) produces a fermented liquor along with the floating bacterial cellulosic pellicle called as Kombucha. This review explores the possible applications of kombucha SCOBY to use bacterial cellulose-based engineered living materials, commercial superabsorbent spheres by various marketing ventures like food, pharmaceutics, biomedical applications for bio-sensing and bio-catalysis, crop biostimulants, biocontrol agents in the management of plant and animal illnesses, post-harvest management in crops, water purification, pollutant detection, environmental biotechnology, and production of SCOBY from alternative substrates and agrarian waste management. The plausible use of bacterial cellulose hydrogels in dryland agriculture for their exceptional water-absorbing capability, eco-friendly nature, capacity to break down naturally, and compatibility with other living organisms is also elaborated in this paper. Furthermore, diverse microbial species to enhance the variety and functional properties of SCOBY, health benefits and its influence on human welfare is vividly discussed in the paper. The very in-depth study on the uses of SCOBY also paves way for the research exploration of this under-utilized microbial boon in food and farm sector for circular based regenerative agriculture in near future.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":1},"references":52,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
