The broadly-used GAL promoter system for engineered yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) suffers from several drawbacks; specifically, unintended induction during laboratory development, and unintended repression in industrial production applications, which decreases overall production capacity. Eukaryotic synthetic circuits have not been well examined to address these problems. Here, we explore a modularised engineering method to deploy new genetic circuits applicable for expanding the control of GAL promoter-driven heterologous pathways in S. cerevisiae . Trans - and cis - modules, including eukaryotic trans -activating-and-repressing mechanisms, were characterised to provide new and better tools for circuit design. A eukaryote-like tetracycline-mediated circuit that delivers stringent repression was engineered to minimise metabolic burden during strain development and maintenance. This was combined with a novel 37 °C induction circuit to relief glucose-mediated repression on the GAL promoter during the bioprocess. This delivered a 44% increase in production of the terpenoid nerolidol, to 2.54 g L −1 in flask cultivation. These negative/positive transcriptional regulatory circuits expand global strategies of metabolic control to facilitate laboratory maintenance and for industry applications.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":29},"references":74,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
