This study employed a framework synthesis approach to identified factors affecting the smallholders' decision-making in innovation adoption in animal husbandry in South-East Asia (SEA) and unravelled the interactions between these factors. First, we composed an initial framework based on worldwide reviews on (agriculture) innovation adoption. Next, we conducted a systematic review and identified 19 adoption factors: 7 individual, 6 socio-institutional, and 6 environmental factors. These factors were subdivided into 58 subfactors and scored both absolutely and relatively on their influence on farmers' decision-making processes. At the individual farmers' level, human and social capital subfactors with high importance were skills and knowledge, education, access to training, and being a member of a farmer group. At the socio-institutional level, learning platforms (extension services and training) were moderately important. These subfactors were interrelated and influenced by other factors, like age and culture. Important innovation characteristics affecting farmers' motivation for innovation adoption were benefits, price, and compatibility. Highly important (sub)factors that contributed to the financial capital of farmers at the socio-institutional level, are the provision of grants, incentives, and loans. Water, soil condition, and climate risk were highly important environmental pressures affecting farmers' innovation adoption. Finally, we synthesized the factors with (high) importance into the Framework for Innovation Adoption of Animal Husbandry Farmers in SEA (FIFSEAFootnote1","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":90,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
