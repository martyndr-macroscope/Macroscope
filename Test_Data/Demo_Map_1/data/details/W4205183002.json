In some countries, such as the US, synthetic biology is academically and industrially established, while in others, including Germany, it is still an upcoming field of research. Issues with funding schemes, commercial translation of technologies, public perception, and regulations need to be addressed to establish synthetic biology as a key discipline of the 21st century. This perspective article reviews the German and European synthetic biology landscape and how the German Association for Synthetic Biology (GASB) is addressing the above-mentioned challenges with its events and community-building activities.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":12},"references":28,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
