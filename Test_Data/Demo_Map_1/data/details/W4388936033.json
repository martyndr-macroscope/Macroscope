Methods for separating the wheat germ in both the grain cleaning and grinding departments have been studied. A method has been proposed for obtaining wheat germ using a beaker with subsequent pneumatic separation of passing products. To grind wheat germ to a finely dispersed composition with a solid particle size of less than 100 microns, a dry mechanical activation method using a disintegrator is provided. The chemical and amino acid composition of the resulting wheat germ flour was studied. The homogeneous fine composition of wheat germ flour made it possible to use it in the production of bakery products without deteriorating their quality. The developed technology for processing wheat germ is resource saving, environmentally friendly and allows you to preserve completely all biologically valuable substances present in the by-products of wheat processing.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":11,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
