The Crescentia cujete species produces cuias, fruits that turn into domestic objects through an ancestral artisanal process that can be considered highly ecological from a design perspective. The study starts with a literature review in Biodesign, Biology, and Anthropology. Then, a mixed method approach was adopted, involving historical research on cuiaÂ´s production process, direct interaction with trees in a bioeconomy context, interviews and participative observation of traditional artisans, and the integration of these methods. The historical record indicated that biofabrication using cuieiras is an ancient practice, and the results of the experiments demonstrated the potential of cuieira trees for biofabrication nowadays, as evidenced by a broad range of tests that enhance our understanding of this plant-human collaboration. The success of this partnership is partly attributed to the designers' deep engagement with the trees, establishing a level of intimacy that facilitates a strong alliance in design. Furthermore, the process of form-giving involves an ongoing dialogue that acknowledges the dependence of form on ecological considerations. Finally, the discussion and conclusion draw attention to the design field's undervaluation of indigenous objects and techniques and highlight the disparity between industrialized systems versus designing with living organisms.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":4,"cited_by_count":2},"references":16,"networkCitations":4,"seed":false}
