Building on an ancient relationship between fungi and humankind—well documented by ethnomycology literature and advanced through both biotechnology and creative practice—a new partnership between design, science and industry leaders has pioneered the market introduction of fungi-derived products. The careful crafting of material, aesthetic and performance properties, paired with an open, collaborative and conscious approach to material innovation, has meant that the early concept designs, protypes, and commercially realised applications, present a holistically considered future of mycelium products, environments and systems. This chapter charts an overview of key moments, considerations and stakeholders in this growing design domain, with a view to providing a resource for the next generation of innovators, who will advance the scope and future applications of fungi in design.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":6},"references":19,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
