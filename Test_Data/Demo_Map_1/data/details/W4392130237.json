MedTech companies play a crucial role in advancing circularity within the sector by adopting sustainable approaches to product design, resource management, and waste reduction. This research aims to explore how MedTech companies initiate and drive transformation towards circular practices and the key factors influencing their successful transition. Using a qualitative approach, four multinational MedTech companies' case studies are conducted, employing semi-structured interviews with 33 managers and healthcare professionals. The results reveal a model grounded in dynamic capabilities, comprising three stages: sensing, seizing, and transforming, guided by adaptability and flexibility. The study extends the understanding of how MedTech companies can proactively respond to environmental challenges and embrace circular economy practices. Furthermore, the model offers practical implications for MedTech companies to foster sustainable practices, optimize resources, and enhance circularity in the healthcare industry.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":10},"references":43,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
