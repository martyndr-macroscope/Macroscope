Multiple scenarios and speculative cultural manifestations for food futures coexist and compete for public and political attention. The proposed paper will discuss speculative design and art approaches to food, focusing on de-extincted meat and in vitro meat. De-extinction is treated through the examples of Center for Genomic Gastronomy's 'De-extinction Deli', which ironically suggests that animal species brought back from extinction would again become objects for consumption, and Ai Hasegawa's 'I Wanna Deliver a Dolphin', in which the designer proposes that human women might give birth to endangered Maui dolphins, and, as one of several possibilities, that the animals might then be eaten by their 'mothers'. In vitro meat is discussed through the Tissue Culture and Art Project's Victimless Utopia series, which featured the first actual lab-grown meat to be consumed by humans, as well as Next Nature's speculative design prototypes of in vitro meat products. I argue that these artists and designers capture what Hal Herzog has called 'the troubled middle', who exhibit most clearly our propensity to put animals to more than one use: we might have a pet bunny, yet eat rabbit in a restaurant. These art and design pieces, therefore, provide the audience with open-ended scenarios, inducing reflection about what our present, and future, meat consumption can be like, as well as what it can entail.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":0},"references":10,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
