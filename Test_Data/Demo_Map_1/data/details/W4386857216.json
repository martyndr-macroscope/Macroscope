Recent happenings in the fashion industry especially activities of fast fashion have promoted rapid production of apparel and accessories to meet the taste and preferences of consumers. These products have resulted in clothing waste ending up in landfills, or burnt in the open, which poses severe environmental risks. Considering this, a mini review was conducted to investigate sustainable technological innovations within circular fashion and bio-based materials which have been advanced in the fashion industry. These recent advances have influenced the possibility of ensuring a cost-effective solution for consumers, limiting waste, and reducing carbon emissions in the environment. Furthermore, we present a selection of case studies by brands and designers on new approaches and materials developed within the circular fashion concept and for bio-based materials. Findings show varying approaches and technologies developed within the circular fashion concept to reduce clothing waste products in the environment. Circular fashion has introduced approaches such as resale, repair, and rent models, the concept of recycling for textile waste, and the concept of disassembly in design which ensures the possibility of easily deconstructing the various parts of a product without any difficulty. Additionally, the development of bio-fabricated materials, bio-dyes, and do-it-yourself (DIY) materials from natural sources has promoted bio-materials with less environmental impact. Consumer perception remained an important element for effective sustainable fashion. Findings revealed that price plays a critical role in influencing consumers to purchase bio-based materials and recycled clothing, with others willing to buy these products due to the environmental impact. It is recommended for effective collaborative efforts between consumers, industry, and the government, for a positive mindset and shift towards a sustained fashion industry.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":14},"references":80,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
