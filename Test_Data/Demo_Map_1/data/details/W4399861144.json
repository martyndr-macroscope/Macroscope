The chapters illuminate various roles that artefacts can play in human perception and action during interaction with materials and tools. In Chapter 10 \"Traces of Craft Experience in Artefacts\", textile practitioner-researcher Nithikul Nimkulrat discusses the traces of making that can be seen in the artefacts resulting from her attentive material engagement. The artefact can reveal the maker's intentions and interactions with the materials, tools, and environment, even if the process of making involves digital tools and takes place in a virtual space. Expert practitioners can read traces in the artefact and follow the processes of other craft practitioners, their actions, and tools used. The author argues that these are traces of human thoughts that demonstrate the inseparable process of making and thinking in the haptic engagement with materials.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"hybrid","network":{"internal_citations":8,"cited_by_count":1},"references":158,"networkCitations":8,"seed":false}
