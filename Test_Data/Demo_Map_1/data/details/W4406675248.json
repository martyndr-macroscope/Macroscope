Despite these potential benefits, their production and commercialization still face several obstacles that might hinder their widespread adoption. The present systematic review aimed to offer a thorough analysis of the multi-level supply-side barriers across researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals. Searches were performed in Web of Science, SCOPUS, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore between June and July 2023. Publications between 2019 and 2023 were considered for analysis (n = 176). Content was coded following a PICO structure and the results were reported following the PRISMA checklist. We found that technological and knowledge barriers were the most identified, followed by economic, regulatory, supply stability, and behavioral challenges. Moreover, we found that 82% of the documents identified more than one barrier, reflecting the complex interaction between the different challenges in the field. Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, establishing clear regulatory frameworks, and enhancing communication strategies are relevant recommendations for overcoming these barriers. These findings draft a multifaceted roadmap of the key barriers in the commercialization of new, sustainable biopolymer production technologies, and carry significant implications for future research, policy development, and industry practices.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":10},"references":126,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
