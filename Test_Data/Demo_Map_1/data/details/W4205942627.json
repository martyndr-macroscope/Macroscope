In this sense, the Italian designer Carmelo Di Bartolo proposes as part of his philosophy, the consideration of design of materials integrating bionics, through a discourse and practice that values nature in the design process. Consider the product integrating a material-based approach as a suggestive and communicative element, or as a constitutive part of an efficient structure. The teachings of Di Bartolo are reflected in experiences developed in undergraduate and graduate education, as well as research in Chile. A reference being exemplified in the WINNER project that proposes the design of a dynamic facade based on the analysis of functional principles of nature, responsive to the solar energy capture.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"diamond","network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":11,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
