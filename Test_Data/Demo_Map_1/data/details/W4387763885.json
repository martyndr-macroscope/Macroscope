The main driver of this trend is the search for a sustainable future by proposing novel alternatives that could substitute or integrate into society’s current production and consumption models. This study presents the development of an open-source bioreactor capable of enhancing and optimizing a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) production process. The bioreactor is part of a greater design-driven project aiming to process edible and non-edible materials. The study presents the experiments and methods that led to the development and refinement of the current bioreactor, and all the information needed to replicate it with tools and equipment currently available under the Creative Commons status. The aim of sharing open-source methods and results to reproduce the bioreactor is to support different interdisciplinary teams of scientists and designers in generating high amounts of SCOBY, accelerating R&amp;D with this auspicious yet underexplored source of bacterial cellulose.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":5},"references":36,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
