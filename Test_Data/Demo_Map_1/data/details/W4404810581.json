This paper explores these challenges through the case study of bacterial cellulose using qualitative methodology of 20 semi-structured interviews with design and science practitioners. Key themes include (1) collaboration: mentorship, types of experiences, and limitations, (2) differences: terminology, learning and resources, and (3) the role of designers in the laboratory. Findings indicate that while scientists adapt with bacterial cellulose, fashion researchers struggle with biotechnological terminology and practices. Insights from the fashion participants also reveal strategies for overcoming these challenges. This paper concludes by proposing the Interdisciplinary Innovation in Fashion Biotechnology Framework to foster collaboration between the fields. Future work should focus on opportunities for designers to access and engage with scientific laboratories, while encouraging scientists to collaborate with designers in studio environments.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":5,"cited_by_count":2},"references":23,"networkCitations":5,"seed":false}
