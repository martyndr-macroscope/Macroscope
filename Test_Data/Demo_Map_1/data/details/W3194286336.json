We focus on the question of how RRI can have long-lasting impact and persist beyond the time horizon of funded projects. For this purpose, we suggest the concept of 'responsibility by design' which is intended to encapsulate the idea of embedding RRI in research and innovation in a way that makes it part of the fabric of the resulting outcomes, in our case, a distributed European Research Infrastructure.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":6,"cited_by_count":61},"references":60,"networkCitations":6,"seed":false}
