This paper argues that participation and responsibility are incompatible with the uncontrolled dynamics of the market and with what Gerald Doppelt calls the 'Lockean code' of private ownership of the means of production. Responsible innovation aims, in part, to facilitate the expression of what Anthony Giddens terms 'life politics.' Without challenging the mediation of the relationship between science, technology, and society by the market, arguments for participatory science and technology and responsible innovation remain within the political framework of Giddens' Third Way. This paper makes the case for looking beyond Third Way politics toward socialist democratic planning as the future for participatory and responsible innovation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":9},"references":139,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
