To augment existing expression plasmids for metabolic engineering, we developed a series of dual‐inducible duet‐expression vectors for P. putida KT2440. A number of inducible promoters (P lac , P tac , P tetR/tetA and P bad ) were used in different combinations to differentially regulate the expression of individual genes. Protein expression was evaluated by measuring the fluorescence of reporter proteins (GFP and RFP). Our experiments demonstrated the use of compatible plasmids, a useful approach to coexpress multiple genes in P. putida KT2440. These duet vectors were modified to generate a fully inducible CRISPR interference system using two catalytically inactive Cas9 variants from S. pasteurianus (dCas9) and S. pyogenes (spdCas9). The utility of developed CRISPRi system(s) was demonstrated by repressing the expression of nine conditionally essential genes, resulting in growth impairment and prolonged lag phase for P. putida KT2440 growth on glucose. Furthermore, the system was shown to be tightly regulated, tunable and to provide a simple way to identify essential genes with an observable phenotype.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":15},"references":51,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
