Based on the obtained front free-form surfaces, this paper establishes the relationship between the discrete points on the subsequent free-form surfaces and their spatial solid angles and, through extremely complex theoretical deduction, finally obtains the subsequent free-form surfaces. In addition, by combining the two free-form surfaces to enter the 3D modeling software, we can obtain an optical lens with multiple free-form surfaces to improve the digital simulation effect. Finally, this paper uses the intelligent system constructed in this paper to conduct multiple sets of simulation experiments to evaluate the digital effect and artistic design effect of the system constructed in this paper. From the experimental research, it can be known that the art online design system based on digital simulation technology constructed in this paper basically meets the expected goals of the system constructed in this paper.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":0,"cited_by_count":2},"references":22,"networkCitations":0,"seed":false}
