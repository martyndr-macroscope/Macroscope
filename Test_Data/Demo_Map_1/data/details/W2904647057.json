It draws on a one-year collaboration among two anthropologists, two artists, a soil ecologist, and a geographer working toward an exhibition on the heavily anthropogenic soils of cities. The preparation of speculative Soil Fictions—narrative installations shown in the exhibition—allowed experimenting with new modes of inquiry that proved complementary to more traditional ethnographic methods. The authors argue in favor of wider recognition of such experiments within anthropology.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":9},"references":64,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
