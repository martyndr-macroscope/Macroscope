Cellular agriculture addresses the environmental burdens associated with conventional animal agriculture by cultivating animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs from cell cultures rather than traditional livestock farming. The chapter explores cellular agriculture's technological advancements, economic implications, and regulatory challenges, emphasizing its role in decreasing deforestation, methane emissions, and water usage. Furthermore, it highlights the potential for cellular agriculture to reduce the reliance on antibiotics, thereby contributing to public health. Through a comprehensive analysis of current research, case studies, and future projections, this chapter underscores the critical importance of cellular agriculture in the global effort to combat climate change and foster a sustainable food system.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":0},"references":128,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
