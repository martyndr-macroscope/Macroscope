This characteristic is a result of the interplay of composition, structure and self-assembly of spider silk proteins (spidroins). Advances in synthetic biology have enabled the design and production of spidroins with the aim of biomimicking the structure-property-function relationships of spider silks. Although in nature only fibers are formed from spidroins,","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":23},"references":139,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
