Our investigation seeks to examine BISCO plaster (BRP) and a mixture of resin and hardener in three proportions (30%, 45%, and 60%) to achieve our ultimate goal, which is to preserve the environment and achieve the vision of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2030 to reach zero carbon emissions by 2060? Emissions tests were performed, and although the CO2 level was zero, they emitted SO2 sulfur dioxide and NO2 nitrogen dioxide, and 60% was the lowest emission rate. We also used ANSYS 2023 R1 software to compare them with their mechanical properties resulting from tensile and compression testing. In this study, we looked closely at the mechanical characteristics of different materials designed for wall coverings, with particular emphasis on their environmental sustainability. We carried out experiments to gauge the tensile and compressive stress on samples with varying mixing ratios. Our main objective was on crucial mechanical properties such as the modulus of elasticity, ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, yield strain, modulus of resilience, and ductility. Through meticulous scrutiny, we determined that the amalgamation of these mechanical attributes at the 30% mixing ratio provides an optimal combination for attaining structural integrity, adaptability, and resilience in wall coverings. Significantly, this ratio also underscores a commitment to environmentally conscious material selection. Our study offers important new insights into the selection of wall covering materials by providing a detailed understanding of their mechanical behavior under various stress conditions. It aligns with the increasing significance of environmental responsibility in contemporary design and construction. By emphasizing the 30% mixing ratio, our findings establish a foundation for informed decision making, promoting the utilization of sustainable materials that achieve a balance between strength, flexibility, and longevity. This ensures optimal performance in practical applications while simultaneously minimizing the environmental impact.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":4},"references":33,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
