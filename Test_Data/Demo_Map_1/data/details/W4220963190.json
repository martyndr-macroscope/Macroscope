This article assumes that a general typology of metaphors developed by practices related to bio-art can be categorised into two categories: pictorial and operational metaphors. Through these, information regarding several biological issues is transferred to the public arena. Based on the analysis, this article attempts to answer the following questions: How does bio-art develop metaphors to advance epistemic and discursive agendas that constitute public understanding of a set of deeply problematic assumptions regarding how today’s biology operates? Under the influence of today’s synthetic biology, could bio-media operationally reframe these epistemic agendas by reframing complex and multi-layered metaphors towards post-metaphoric structures? Finally, what are the scientific, cultural, and social implications of reframing?","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":6},"references":52,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
