Phoenix canariensis palm leaves, one of the most common plants found in the local environment of the Alicante region (Spain), was used as a biomass raw material. Determining appropriate processing parameters and their desired range of maximum cellulose extraction states is key to improving yields. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the effect of processing conditions on cellulose extraction by optimizing the hydrothermal process, as a part of overall combined processes involving several steps. Specifically, the time of the steam-explosion stage was varied between 15 and 33 min in order to maximize the cellulose extraction yield. The composition of both the extracted fibers and the resulting by-product solutions generated during the different steps were determined by FTIR and TGA in order to analyze the effectiveness of removing hemicellulose, lignin and extractives as well as the removed substances at each stage for their further valorization. Additionally, the morphology of cellulosic fibers was evaluated by SEM and their crystallinity by XRD. Crystalline cellulose fibers were successfully extracted from pruning biomass wastes, achieving more efficient removal of hemicellulose and lignin when the hydrothermal process was assessed over 25–33 min. This resulted in finer and smoother fibers, but the crystallinity of α-cellulose decreased as the time of steam-explosion increased to 33 min. The characterization of waste solutions generated after the different extraction steps confirmed that the most effective treatments to remove lignin and hemicellulose from the cell wall are alkaline pretreatment and a hydrothermal process.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":"gold","network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":23},"references":47,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
