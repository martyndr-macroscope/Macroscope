However, this approach lacks a comprehensive visual comfort framework, as it does not simultaneously address spatial glare distribution, uniform high useful daylight levels across all sensor points, and overheating prevention through regulated annual solar exposure. Nevertheless, decentralized control facilitates autonomous operation of the individual façade components, addressing all the objectives. This study integrates a biomimetic functional approach with building performance simulations by computational design to evaluate different kinetic façade configurations. Through the implementation of parametric modeling and daylight analysis, we have identified an optimal angular configuration (60° for the focal region, 50° for the non-focal region) that significantly increases building performance. The optimized design demonstrates substantial improvements, reducing excessive sunlight exposure by 45–55% and glare incidence by 65–72% compared to other dynamic solutions. The recommended steeper angles achieve superior performance, maintaining high useful daylight illuminance (UDI &gt; 91.5%) while dramatically improving visual comfort. Sensitivity analysis indicates that even minor angular adjustments (5–10°) can induce a 10–15% variation in glare performance, emphasizing the necessity of precise control mechanisms in both focal and non-focal regions of the façade. These findings establish a framework for creating responsive building façades that balance daylight provision with occupant comfort in real-time operation.","is_oa":true,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":7,"cited_by_count":2},"references":63,"networkCitations":7,"seed":false}
