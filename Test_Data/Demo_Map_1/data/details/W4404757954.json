Designers have started to develop innovative approaches towards the use of bio-based materials. Developing innovative approaches in textile surface formation, the use of natural materials, and sustainable design conceivable as a significant step. The use of natural materials such as grass roots provides an organic and natural feel in design, while making an important contribution to sustainable textile and fashion design. In this study, the use of bio-based materials in textile surface formation will be exemplified with contemporary artists and designers. Bio-based materials will be examined under the headings of bacteria and yeasts, fungi, algae, and PLA. In this context, the \"Grassroot\" used in textile surface formation will be described. \"Grassroot\" is an expression used to create a surface by directing plant roots and seeds through molds. \"Grassroot\", being a natural material, stand out as an alternative option with infinite sustainability in textile surface formation. Artists such as Diana Scherer and Zena Holloway have done important work in creating textile surfaces using grass root, creating a unique bridge between nature and human creativity. These artists will be emphasized, and their works will be explained with examples. The study was restricted based on the characteristics of the sample and was constrained by the instances that were chosen.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":2,"cited_by_count":0},"references":6,"networkCitations":2,"seed":false}
