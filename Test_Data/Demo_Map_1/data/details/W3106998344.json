I argue that, while it can be difficult to convey the complex natural characteristics of corals through displays of coral specimens in museums, exhibitions such as Coral: Something Rich and Strange (2013–14), and artworks such as Christine and Margaret Wertheim’s Crochet Coral Reef (2005–present) and Tamiko Thiel’s Unexpected Growth (2018–19), can deepen a sense of wonder in exhibition visitors and foster experiences of connection between humans and marine invertebrates – ultimately to encourage ‘response-ability’ to and for the natural world. I suggest that collaborative, cross-disciplinary modes of exhibition making – such as displaying works of art alongside scientific or natural history specimens – provides curators with opportunities to intensify the affective responses of audiences.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":1,"cited_by_count":3},"references":11,"networkCitations":1,"seed":false}
