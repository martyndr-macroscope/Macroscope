While the classic conservation debate on coral reef restoration still treats these ecosystems as “sick patients,” a radically different view of convivial conservation is beginning to challenge exclusive human control over these endangered habitats. Putting aside notions of natural “purity” and adopting a much more humble and highly interconnected perspective on marine habitats, we can begin to see reefs as transformative, sympoïetic and blasted seascapes for a convivial future. The discipline of biodesign has been primarily focussed on researching ecological relationships with regard to new materials and products. The emerging interest in shaping the multi-layered ecological relationships of habitats for other-than-human lives, however, is steering design practice towards terraforming or, in the case of marine environments, “aquaforming.” This paper argues for taking convivial conservation practices in marine environments as a starting point for the development of a new design methodology that focuses on the design of living systems in open environments: a proposed methodology called Sympoïetic Design.","is_oa":false,"oa_status":null,"network":{"internal_citations":3,"cited_by_count":1},"references":48,"networkCitations":3,"seed":false}
