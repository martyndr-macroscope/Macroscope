The paper \"Bio Design: Nature + Science + Creativity\" emerged as a pivotal work during this period, showcasing approximately seventy innovative projects that utilized living materials and processes to address the challenges posed by finite resources and a burgeoning global population. This exploration underscored both the aesthetic and functional dimensions of bio design while simultaneously raising ethical questions regarding the manipulation of life for human benefit. The findings from this research contributed meaningfully to the discourse surrounding sustainable design practices and the future of bioengineering [1*].\n\nIn parallel, another paper tackled the integration of engineering design principles into synthetic biology, aiming to enhance the efficiency of creating synthetic gene networks. This work highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations among biologists, engineers, artists, and social theorists, suggesting that diverse perspectives are crucial for shaping the field. The insights gained from these collaborations not only illuminated the societal implications of biological technologies but also fostered innovative research and design principles. This advocacy for a broader design approach marked a significant shift in the discourse on synthetic biology, emphasizing the need for a holistic understanding of the field [2*].\n\nFurther exploring this intersection, another paper examined the implications of treating living matter as programmable material. By focusing on collaborations between synthetic biologists and artists, the authors presented innovative projects that challenged traditional boundaries, such as biological computers and self-assembling packaging. These initiatives prompted critical questions about creativity, the nature of designed matter, and the role of aesthetics in scientific inquiry. The work ultimately contributed to a deeper understanding of how synthetic biology could reshape our relationship with nature and technology, reflecting a continuity of thought from earlier discussions while pushing the boundaries of creativity and ethics in design [3*]. \n\nOverall, the period from 2010 to 2014 marked a significant evolution in the discourse surrounding bio design and synthetic biology, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethical considerations inherent in manipulating living systems.\n\n## 2015–2019\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, a significant body of research emerged addressing the intricate relationships between biotechnology, synthetic biology, and their implications for society, ethics, and environmental sustainability. This period marked a notable shift towards interdisciplinary collaboration, emphasizing the integration of natural systems into technological frameworks, and a growing recognition of the ethical dimensions inherent in these fields.\n\nOne of the foundational concepts introduced during this period was the notion of \"embodied intelligence,\" which proposed a framework for integrating living systems into the built environment. This approach diverged from traditional machine-based methodologies, focusing instead on materials capable of basic decision-making to enhance sustainability in design practices, such as Bio Design. The findings indicated that embodied intelligence could redefine sustainability by promoting material longevity and reducing maintenance needs, ultimately fostering environments that support life processes and enhance urban fertility [4*].\n\nIn parallel, the intersection of biotechnology and art, termed \"BioArt,\" gained traction as a means to challenge conventional perceptions of life and creativity. This multidisciplinary approach highlighted how BioArt could raise awareness about biotechnological advancements while provoking critical discussions regarding ethical implications and societal impacts. The authors argued that BioArt serves as a platform for public engagement, fostering dialogue on complex issues such as genetic engineering and sustainability, thus positioning it as a significant cultural phenomenon in contemporary society [5].\n\nThe discourse surrounding synthetic biology also evolved, with critiques of the traditional \"ethical, legal and social implications\" (ELSI) framework advocating for a shift towards \"post-ELSI\" practices. This transition was characterized by an emphasis on flexibility and adaptability in interdisciplinary collaborations, particularly within the UK synthetic biology community. The authors identified various roles assumed by social scientists in these collaborations, suggesting that a post-ELSI landscape could foster more productive methodologies in technoscience [6].\n\nThe metaphors associated with epigenetics were scrutinized, revealing that while certain source domains could be identified, the target domains remained ambiguous. This ambiguity underscored the challenges scientists faced in defining the implications of epigenetics and effectively communicating this emerging field to the public [7]. Moreover, the evolving metaphors in synthetic biology were examined, with a focus on how they shaped perceptions of life and responsibility, advocating for interdisciplinary dialogue to foster responsible research practices [37].\n\nThe potential of synthetic biology to reshape societal futures was further explored through the creation of novel life forms, with bioengineers redefining nature as a malleable entity. This \"promise-economy\" surrounding synthetic biology often led to bold claims about future advancements, sometimes detached from current research limitations. The emergence of \"digital biology\" emphasized the programmable nature of life and the socio-technical implications of these innovations [8]. Concurrently, public engagement in synthetic biology was highlighted as crucial for fostering understanding and dialogue, with calls for innovative communication strategies to enhance public discourse [9].\n\nThe transformative potential of synthetic biology in pharmaceutical production was also a focal point, with advancements in computational and experimental tools facilitating the discovery and optimization of bioactive molecules. Successful applications, such as the semi-synthetic production of artemisinin, demonstrated how engineered microbial systems could efficiently produce pharmaceuticals, thereby enhancing the diversity of chemical libraries and improving production processes [10].\n\nEducational initiatives, such as the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, were recognized for their role in enhancing microbiology education through synthetic biology projects. The interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology was emphasized, with iGEM fostering collaboration among students and raising awareness of ethical issues in biotechnology [11]. This educational framework was complemented by discussions on the evolution of synthetic biology, which transitioned from traditional biological analysis to synthesis as a means of understanding and engineering biological systems [12].\n\nThe philosophy of biomimicry emerged as a significant area of inquiry, proposing that understanding Nature as a model, measure, and mentor could inform sustainable practices and foster a deeper relationship between humanity and the natural world [13]. This perspective was echoed in discussions on the integration of biological systems into architectural design, where metabolically engineered building units were proposed to create self-sustaining living environments, enhancing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability [26].\n\nThe ethical implications of synthetic biology and its applications in food production were critically examined, particularly in the context of in vitro meat technologies. The discourse highlighted the promises of healthier, environmentally friendly, and more humane meat alternatives, while also scrutinizing the underlying assumptions and omissions in this narrative [15]. The complexities surrounding the corporatization of agriculture and the ethical challenges posed by smart farming technologies were also addressed, advocating for a biomimetic framework that aligns technological innovations with ecological principles [43].\n\nAs the field of synthetic biology continued to evolve, the governance of innovation became a critical focus, with calls for responsible research and innovation (RRI) practices to guide the development of emerging technologies. The need for reflexivity and inclusivity in shaping synthetic biology futures was emphasized, with collaborative processes involving various stakeholders being essential for fostering responsible innovation [58].
